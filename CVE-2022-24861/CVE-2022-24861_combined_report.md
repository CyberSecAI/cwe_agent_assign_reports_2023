## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **rootcause** of **JDBC drivers not being validated prior to use**. This allows an attacker to provide a malicious JDBC driver containing hardcoded credentials, leading to remote code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified CWE-798 as a strong candidate due to the **lack of validation** of JDBC drivers, which could allow for the inclusion of malicious code or **hard-coded credentials**. The CVE description explicitly mentions that JDBC drivers are not validated. This directly aligns with CWE-798.

The evidence from the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section states that the application downloads a JDBC driver from a URL provided by the user and loads the driver class without proper validation, enabling an attacker to provide a malicious JAR file. This malicious JAR file could contain code that uses **hard-coded credentials**.

The Retriever Results highlight CWE-798 as a potential match.

Based on the analysis, the primary CWE is CWE-798, representing the use of hard-coded credentials within a malicious JDBC driver.
CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) and CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) are considered as secondary candidates if the malicious driver specifically contains one or the other. The selection of CWE-798 is at the optimal level of specificity.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-24861

## Vulnerability Description
Databasir is a team-oriented relational database model document management platform. Databasir 1.01 has remote code execution vulnerability. **JDBC drivers are not validated prior to use** and may be provided by users of the system. This can lead to code execution by any basic user who has access to the system. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds to this issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **JDBC drivers are not validated prior to use**
- **impact:** remote code execution
- **attacker:** basic user with access to system
- **product:** Databasir
- **version:** 1.01

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24861:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the application handles JDBC driver loading. Specifically, the application downloads a JDBC driver from a URL provided by the user and then loads the driver class using `URLClassLoader`. This process does not validate the downloaded JAR file, allowing an attacker to provide a malicious JAR file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unvalidated JAR Loading:** The application downloads and loads JAR files from user-specified URLs without proper validation or sanitization.
- **Remote Code Execution:** By providing a malicious JAR file containing arbitrary code, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server.
- **Lack of input validation:** The application does not validate the content of the JAR file nor the driver class name.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application. This could lead to:
    - Data breach or exfiltration.
    - Full compromise of the server and application.
    - Denial of service attacks.
- **System takeover:** An attacker could gain complete control of the affected server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Database Extension Configuration:** The attacker manipulates the application by creating a database extension and providing a malicious URL as the "JDBC Driver Download Address."
- **Project Sync:** The attacker then initiates a "Sync" operation within a project using the malicious database extension, which triggers the download and execution of the attacker's crafted JAR.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the application.
- **Ability to configure database extensions:** The attacker must have sufficient privileges to create or modify database extensions.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs a way to host the malicious jar file and provide a valid URL to it.

**Technical Details and Description**

The vulnerability occurs within the `CustomDatabaseConnectionFactory.java` file, specifically in the `getConnection` method. The method performs the following actions:

1.  Downloads the JDBC driver JAR file from a URL specified in the database type configuration.
2.  Creates a `URLClassLoader` to load classes from the downloaded JAR.
3.  Loads the specified driver class using `Class.forName()`
4.  Instantiates the driver class via `getConstructor().newInstance()`, thereby executing any code within the constructor or static blocks of the provided class.

The vulnerability is triggered when the application connects to a database using an attacker-controlled driver. The attacker provides a malicious JAR file that executes arbitrary code on the server during the class loading or instantiation process.

The fix involved adding the `DriverResources::validateJar` method which validates if the driver class implements the `java.sql.Driver` interface. Additionally, the `JwtTokens` class was modified to use a configurable secret via the `databasir.jwt.secret` property instead of a hardcoded value, and the `resolveDriverClassName` was refactored.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.

**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The main difference between the use of hard-coded passwords and the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys is the false sense of security that the former conveys. Many people believe that simply hashing a hard-coded password before storage will protect the information from malicious users. However, many hashes are reversible (or at least vulnerable to brute force attacks) -- and further, many authentication protocols simply request the hash itself, making it no better than a password.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29960:** Engineering Workstation uses hard-coded cryptographic keys that could allow for unathorized filesystem access and privilege escalation
- **CVE-2022-30271:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used by default.
- **CVE-2020-10884:** WiFi router service has a hard-coded encryption key, allowing root access




## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

### Extended Description

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Sensitive information could include data that is sensitive in and of itself (such as credentials or private messages), or otherwise useful in the further exploitation of the system (such as internal file system structure).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses




## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.

### Extended Description


Many web applications use template engines that allow developers to insert externally-influenced values into free text or messages in order to generate a full web page, document, message, etc. Such engines include Twig, Jinja2, Pug, Java Server Pages, FreeMarker, Velocity, ColdFusion, Smarty, and many others - including PHP itself. Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.


Template engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression "{{7*7}}" and determine if the output returns "49" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.


In some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.


Template engines can be used on the server or client, so both "sides" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.


### Alternative Terms
Server-Side Template Injection / SSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a server.
Client-Side Template Injection / CSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a client.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-94

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Since expression languages are often used in templating languages, there may be some overlap with CWE-917 (Expression Language Injection). XSS (CWE-79) is also co-located with template injection.

**[Maintenance]** The interrelationships and differences between CWE-917 and CWE-1336 need to be further clarified.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-34359:** Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a "prompt injection" attack.
- **CVE-2017-16783:** server-side template injection in content management server
- **CVE-2020-9437:** authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection




## CWE-287: Improper Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
authentification: An alternate term is "authentification", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.
AuthN: "AuthN" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authentication" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from "AuthZ," which is an abbreviation of "authorization." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.
AuthC: "AuthC" is used as an abbreviation of "authentication," but it appears to used less frequently than "AuthN."

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).




## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
SQL injection: a common attack-oriented phrase
SQLi: a common abbreviation for "SQL injection"

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-943

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** SQL injection can be resultant from special character mismanagement, MAID, or denylist/allowlist problems. It can be primary to authentication errors.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-32530:** SQL injection in security product dashboard using crafted certificate fields
- **CVE-2021-42258:** SQL injection in time and billing software, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-27101:** SQL injection in file-transfer system via a crafted Host header, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.

### Extended Description


A hard-coded password typically leads to a significant authentication failure that can be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:

```
		Inbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.
		Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.
```
In the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.

The Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.
