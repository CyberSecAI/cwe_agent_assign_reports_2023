CWE-805 is related as it involves incorrect length values leading to out-of-bounds access.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe805[\"CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe125\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe805 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe126 primary\n    class cwe125,cwe805 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows: The application attempts to write data to a buffer, but due to some error, it reads beyond the allocated bounds of the buffer, leading to **buffer over-read**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause described in the vulnerability description and CVE details. The vulnerability description clearly states \"**buffer over-read**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by indicating a \"global-buffer-overflow during a write operation within the `AP4_StdcFileByteStream::WritePartial` function which indicates an attempt to write data beyond the allocated buffer of a global variable, `AP4_GlobalOptions::g_Entries`\". This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read).\n\nThe graph relationships highlight that CWE-126 is a variant of CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), providing a more specific classification. The selection of CWE-126 is preferred due to its higher specificity compared to its base class, CWE-125.\n\nThe Retriever results support this assessment, with CWE-126 being the top combined result. CWE-125 and CWE-805 were also considered, but CWE-126 was deemed the most accurate representation of the vulnerability based on the provided evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity

Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**:

Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index,

abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 5282.34\n**Source**: sparse\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the

that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation. When this",
