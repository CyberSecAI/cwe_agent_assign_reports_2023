## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in Bento4 through 1.6.0-639. A **buffer over-read** exists in the function AP4_StdcFileByteStreamWritePartial located in System/StdC/Ap4StdCFileByteStream.cpp, called from AP4_ByteStreamWrite and AP4_HdlrAtomWriteFields.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **buffer over-read**
- **product:** Bento4
- **version:** through 1.6.0-639
- **component:** function AP4_StdcFileByteStreamWritePartial located in System/StdC/Ap4StdCFileByteStream.cpp

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content relates to potential vulnerabilities found in the `mp4split` binary of the Bento4 project. Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Bug 1 (Global Buffer Overflow):** The fuzzer identified a global-buffer-overflow during a write operation within the `AP4_StdcFileByteStream::WritePartial` function which indicates an attempt to write data beyond the allocated buffer of a global variable, `AP4_GlobalOptions::g_Entries`.
*   **Bug 2 (Segmentation Fault):** The fuzzer triggered a segmentation fault (SEGV) due to a read access at address 0x000000000000,  within `AP4_DescriptorListWriter::Action`. This suggests that the program is attempting to read from an invalid memory location, possibly due to a null pointer dereference or incorrect pointer arithmetic when handling descriptors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Global Buffer Overflow:**  A write operation goes out of bounds of a global variable.
*   **Segmentation Fault/Null Pointer Dereference:** Reading from an invalid memory address due to potential issues with pointers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bug 1:** Could potentially overwrite critical global program data, leading to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Bug 2:**  Leads to a crash, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerabilities are triggered through a crafted MP4 file provided as input to the `mp4split` binary.
*   The input file is processed through the `AP4_StdcFileByteStream`, `AP4_ByteStream` and `AP4_DescriptorListWriter` functionalities leading to the crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a maliciously crafted MP4 file to the `mp4split` tool.
*   No special privileges are explicitly mentioned to trigger these vulnerabilities in the context of the issue, implying it can be exploited by a user with access to running the `mp4split` tool.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities were found using a fuzzer, indicating that the input format might not be thoroughly validated.
*   The reporter indicated that the vulnerabilities were found in version `v1.6.0-639`, and they could not be reproduced in the latest version, suggesting the vulnerability may have been patched.
*   The crash.zip file provides a potential proof of concept (PoC) that was used by the reporter.

## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.

### Extended Description
If an attacker can manipulate the length parameter associated with an input such that it is inconsistent with the actual length of the input, this can be leveraged to cause the target application to behave in unexpected, and possibly, malicious ways. One of the possible motives for doing so is to pass in arbitrarily large input to the application. Another possible motivation is the modification of application state by including invalid data for subsequent properties of the application. Such weaknesses commonly lead to attacks such as buffer overflows and execution of arbitrary code.

- **CVE-2001-0825:** Buffer overflow in internal string handling routine allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a length argument of zero or less, which disables the length check.




## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not initialize a critical resource.

### Extended Description
Many resources require initialization before they can be properly used. If a resource is not initialized, it could contain unpredictable or expired data, or it could be initialized to defaults that are invalid. This can have security implications when the resource is expected to have certain properties or values.

## CWE-170: Improper Null Termination
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not terminate or incorrectly terminates a string or array with a null character or equivalent terminator.

### Extended Description
Null termination errors frequently occur in two different ways. An off-by-one error could cause a null to be written out of bounds, leading to an overflow. Or, a program could use a strncpy() function call incorrectly, which prevents a null terminator from being added at all. Other scenarios are possible.

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Factors: this is usually resultant from other weaknesses such as off-by-one errors, but it can be primary to boundary condition violations such as buffer overflows. In buffer overflows, it can act as an expander for assumed-immutable data.

**[Relationship]** Overlaps missing input terminator.

**[Applicable Platform]** 

Conceptually, this does not just apply to the C language; any language or representation that involves a terminator could have this type of problem.


**[Maintenance]** As currently described, this entry is more like a category than a weakness.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2000-0312:** Attacker does not null-terminate argv[] when invoking another program.
- **CVE-2003-0777:** Interrupted step causes resultant lack of null termination.
- **CVE-2004-1072:** Fault causes resultant lack of null termination, leading to buffer expansion.




## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.
