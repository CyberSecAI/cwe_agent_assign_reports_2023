## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-303 | Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-1390 | Weak Authentication | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-287 | Improper Authentication | 0.5 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-303, which is a child of CWE-1390. CWE-1390 is a child of CWE-287. This hierarchical relationship helps us understand the different levels of abstraction. CWE-303 is at the Base level and provides the most specific description of the **incorrect implementation** of the authentication algorithm, making it the best choice. The other CWEs are at the Class level, and are thus less specific and less preferable.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with an **incorrect implementation** of an authentication algorithm, leading to a **weak authentication** and finally resulting in **improper authentication**. The root cause is the incorrect implementation, which then leads to the impact of **improper authentication**.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description states that the issue is due to expired passwords being able to access the database, leading to **improper authentication**.

The CVE Reference Links Content Summary provides strong evidence: "Expired passwords were not being properly enforced, allowing users with expired passwords to still access the database with full privileges." This indicates an issue with how the authentication algorithm is implemented.

The Retriever Results suggested several CWEs, including CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication), CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), and CWE-303 (Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm).

Based on the provided evidence, CWE-303 (Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm) is the most appropriate choice because it directly addresses the **incorrect implementation** of the authentication logic. CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) are broader and less specific. The hierarchy shows that CWE-303 is a child of CWE-1390, making it a more specific case of **weak authentication**.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.81
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-836: Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product records password hashes in a data store, receives a hash of a password from a client, and compares the supplied hash to the hash obtained from the data store.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users. In fact, it should be noted that recoverable encrypted passwords provide no significant benefit over plaintext passwords since they are subject not only to reuse by malicious attackers but also by malicious insiders. If a system administrator can recover a password directly, or use a brute force search on the available information, the administrator can use the password on other accounts.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 5746.46
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for
