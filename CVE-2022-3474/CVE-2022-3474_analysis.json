CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is a class-level CWE, while CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) is a base-level CWE. The vulnerability involves sending sensitive information, specifically user-provided credentials, to an unintended recipient. While CWE-522 broadly covers the insufficient protection of credentials, CWE-201 more accurately captures the act of inserting sensitive information into sent data, explaining the root cause. CWE-522 is a parent of several more specific weaknesses which should be examined for a better fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe201 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe202[\"CWE-202: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries\"]\n    cwe201 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe522 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the following:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Bad credential handling** within the remote assets API.\n2.  **Weakness:** The system sends all user-provided credentials instead of only the required ones.\n3.  **Impact:** Potential exposure of credentials for unrelated domains to a compromised or malicious remote downloader server.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **bad credential handling** as the root cause, leading to the exposure of sensitive information. The retriever results suggested CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) as a potential candidate. However, after analyzing the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) was also considered because the vulnerability resulted in sending all user-provided credentials.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-522 is a Class-level CWE with several child CWEs that provide more specific details. The vulnerability description highlights that Bazel sends credentials for unrelated domains to the remote downloader, making CWE-201 more applicable.\n\nThe final decision favors CWE-522 as the primary weakness because the **root cause** is **bad credential handling**, and CWE-201 as the secondary weakness to highlight that all user-provided credentials are sent. These CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the **root cause** and the resulting vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
