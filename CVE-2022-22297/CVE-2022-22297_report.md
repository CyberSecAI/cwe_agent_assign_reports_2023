## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-792 | Incomplete Filtering of One or More Instances of Special Elements | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-792, is a variant of CWE-791, which in turn is a child of CWE-790. This shows a hierarchical relationship where CWE-792 is the most specific and relevant. CWE-78, while related to command injection, is considered a secondary candidate because the description focuses on **incomplete filtering** rather than direct command injection.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with an **incomplete filtering of special elements** (CWE-792) in the command line interpreter, leading to the ability to inject commands, which results in **arbitrary file read** and information disclosure.

## Summary of Analysis
Based on the provided evidence, the primary weakness is the **incomplete filtering of special elements** in the command line interpreter. This allows an authenticated user to read arbitrary files via specially crafted command arguments. The "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" section clearly identifies the **rootcause** as "**incomplete filtering of special elements**". The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" also supports this, stating the "**Root cause of vulnerability** is incomplete filtering of special elements in the command line interpreter".

CWE-792 (Incomplete Filtering of One or More Instances of Special Elements) perfectly matches this description. It is a Variant-level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction.

CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')) is a secondary candidate because the vulnerability allows the attacker to inject commands, but the primary issue is the **incomplete filtering** that enables this.

The selection of CWE-792 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the **root cause** described in the vulnerability description.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is "asymmetric."

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*This CWE was not selected because the vulnerability does not explicitly involve resource consumption or amplification.*

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*This CWE was not selected because the vulnerability does not involve resource shutdown or release issues.*

## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*This CWE was not selected because it does not relate to interaction frequency control.*

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

*This CWE was not selected because while it relates to injection, it is too high-level. CWE-792 and CWE-78 are more specific.*

## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the "technical impact" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

*This CWE was not selected as it does not directly relate to the described vulnerability.*

## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.

*This CWE was not selected due to its high-level nature.*

## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected because it does not involve memory allocation issues.*

## CWE-99: Improper Control of Resource Identifiers ('Resource Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not restrict or incorrectly restricts the input before it is used as an identifier for a resource that may be outside the intended sphere of control.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*This CWE was not selected because the vulnerability is not about resource identifier control.*

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

*This CWE was not selected because it is a high-level, catch-all CWE.*
