It has a parent CWE of CWE-285, Improper Authorization, and CWE-284, Improper Access Control. The vulnerability description clearly states a **missing permission check**, which directly aligns with the definition of CWE-862. The secondary CWEs considered were CWE-497, Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere, and CWE-668, Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere. These are related because the **missing authorization** leads to exposure. However, CWE-862 is the most direct and specific representation of the **root cause**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|ChildOf| cwe284\n    cwe497 -->|CanFollow| cwe862\n    cwe668 -->|CanFollow| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe497,cwe668 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization check** (CWE-862), which allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate hosts and ports of Compuware configurations and credentials IDs. This enumeration is the exposure of sensitive information (CWE-497/CWE-668) which could lead to further exploitation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-862, **Missing Authorization**, as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of a **missing permission check** in the vulnerability description. The supporting evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this, stating that the vulnerability stems from a lack of permission checks.\n\nThe retriever results also listed CWE-862 as the top candidate.\n\nThe relationship analysis showed that CWE-862 is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), but CWE-862 is more specific. The secondary CWEs, CWE-497 and CWE-668, represent the impact of the **missing authorization**, but CWE-862 is the **root cause**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-862 directly describes the **missing permission check**, while CWE-497 and CWE-668 describe the resulting information exposure.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
