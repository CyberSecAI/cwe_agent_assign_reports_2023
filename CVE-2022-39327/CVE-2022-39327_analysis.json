CWE-88 is a peer of CWE-78 (CanAlsoBe) and refers to the **IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION** of argument delimiters in a command, which can contribute to the command injection vulnerability. The relationship between these CWEs highlights how the lack of proper input handling can lead to command injection vulnerabilities. Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, providing a detailed view of the weaknesses.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe88[\"CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe78 -- CANALSOBE --> cwe88\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe88 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the Azure CLI **FAILING** to properly neutralize special elements in parameter values, specifically `&` and `|` symbols. PowerShell strips quotation marks, allowing these characters to be interpreted as command execution operators by `cmd.exe`. This leads to arbitrary command execution, representing the impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the vulnerability in Azure CLI is primarily due to **IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION** of special elements, leading to OS command injection. The evidence supports this: \"The core issue is that PowerShell strips quotation marks from input before passing the command to `cmd.exe`. When the command contains special characters like `|` or `&`, these are then interpreted by `cmd.exe` as command execution operators rather than literal parts of a string.\" This directly aligns with CWE-78.\n\nCWE-88 is also considered, as the vulnerability involves improper handling of argument delimiters. However, the primary issue is the injection of OS commands, making CWE-78 the more appropriate primary classification. The selection is based on the provided evidence and the CWE descriptions, ensuring the chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
