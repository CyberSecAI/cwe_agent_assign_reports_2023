The \"Alternative Terms\" for CWE-1333 includes \"ReDOS\" which is present in the Vulnerability Description. The other CWEs were considered but were not as closely aligned with the specific details of the vulnerability. CWE-185 is a parent Class of several more specific Base CWEs related to Regular Expression issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe185[\"CWE-185: Incorrect Regular Expression\"]\n    cwe697[\"CWE-697: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Data Query Language\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    cwe185 -->|CHILDOF| cwe697\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe185 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **inefficient regular expression complexity** (CWE-1333) leading to excessive CPU consumption, which results in a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-1333 as the primary candidate due to the direct mention of \"Regular Expression Denial of Service\" (ReDOS) in both the vulnerability description and as an alternative term for CWE-1333. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause lies in how the `getProcessedPath` function handles long or invalid file path strings, leading to resource exhaustion.\n\nThe decision is based on the provided evidence, specifically:\n- Vulnerability Description: \"A **Regular Expression Denial of Service** (ReDOS) vulnerability\"\n- CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"The `scaffold-helper` package is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack when processing specially crafted file paths...The vulnerability lies in the way the `getProcessedPath` function handles excessively long or invalid file path strings, leading to resource exhaustion.\"\n- CWE-1333 Alternative Terms: \"ReDOS: ReDOS is an abbreviation of 'Regular expression Denial of Service'.\"\n\nCWE-1333 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: the use of an inefficient regular expression that leads to denial of service.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-625: Permissive Regular
