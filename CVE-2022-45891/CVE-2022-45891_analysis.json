Since the **authorization** check is **missing** entirely, CWE-862 is more appropriate than CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization**, where an **authorization** check is performed, but is done incorrectly.\nCWE-434 **Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type** can result from **missing authorization**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe434 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe434 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of root cause and weaknesses is as follows:\n1.  **Missing Authorization (CWE-862):** The application **fails to perform authorization** checks.\n2.  **Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type (CWE-434):** As a consequence of the **missing authorization**, attackers can upload files without proper validation.\n3.  Impact: Attackers can call restricted functions, perform unauthenticated uploads, and access content uploaded by other users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **Missing Authorization (CWE-862)** as the primary weakness, allowing unauthenticated access to restricted functionalities and data. The key evidence supporting this classification is the statement, \"Planet eStream before 6.72.10.07 allows attackers to call restricted functions, and perform unauthenticated uploads (Upload2.ashx) or access content uploaded by other users (View.aspx after Ajax.asmx/SaveGrantAccessList).\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also mentions \"Flaws in the **authorization** scheme of the web application\" and \"**Authorization bypass** vulnerability that allows an attacker to get access to restricted functions of the web application.\"\nThe retriever results listed CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization**, CWE-862 **Missing Authorization**, CWE-285 **Improper Authorization**, CWE-425 **Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')**, CWE-284 **Improper Access Control**, CWE-434 **Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type**, CWE-183 **Permissive List of Allowed Inputs**, and CWE-639 **Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key**.\nCWE-862 is a Class-level CWE. The description for CWE-862 states: \"The product does not perform an **authorization** check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\" This aligns with the **missing authorization** in the vulnerability description allowing attackers to call restricted functions and upload files.\nCWE-434 **Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type** is included because the vulnerability description mentions \"unauthenticated uploads\". CWE-434 is a base-level CWE. The description for CWE-434 states: \"The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\" This aligns with the ability to perform unauthenticated uploads.\nCWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** was considered but not used because it describes scenarios where an **authorization** check is performed incorrectly, whereas the vulnerability description indicates that **authorization** checks are **missing** altogether.\nCWE-285 **Improper Authorization** was considered but not used because it is a higher-level Class, and CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** is a more specific child of CWE-285. The mapping guidance for CWE-285 discourages its use and suggests mapping to CWE-862 instead.\nCWE-284 **Improper Access Control** was considered but not used because it is a Pillar-level CWE, and CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** is a more specific descendant of CWE-284. The mapping guidance for CWE-284 discourages its use and suggests using more specific descendants.\nCWE-425 **Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')** was considered but not used because the primary issue is the **lack of authorization** checks, rather than direct access to resources without proper navigation.\nCWE-183 **Permissive List of Allowed Inputs** was considered but not used because there is no evidence that the application uses a permissive list of allowed inputs that is too permissive.\nCWE-639 **Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key** was considered but not used because there is no mention of a user-controlled key being used to bypass **authorization**.\n\nThe selected CWEs, CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** and CWE-434 **Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type**, are at the optimal level of specificity, representing the **root cause** and a direct consequence of the vulnerability, respectively. They are also base and class level which are preferred levels of abstraction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
