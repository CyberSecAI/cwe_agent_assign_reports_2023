The class CWE-116 can precede CWE-74 (Injection) which is a parent of CWE-79 (XSS). The vulnerability involves a failure to sanitize and encode input which leads to a bypass of CSRF protection, effectively allowing for a type of cross-site scripting attack.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n\n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe116 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe116 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to restrict or sanitize the input step ID** (root cause), which leads to **improper URL encoding**. This ultimately allows attackers to **bypass CSRF protection**, resulting in a potential XSS vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The key aspect is the **lack of sanitization of the input step ID**, which leads to the ability to bypass CSRF protection.\n\nThe **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** state that the **rootcause is that the Jenkins Pipeline Input Step Plugin does not restrict or sanitize the optionally specified ID of the input step**. The **impact** is that it allows attackers to bypass the CSRF protection of any target URL in Jenkins.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the connection between improper encoding (CWE-116) and injection vulnerabilities (CWE-74), and how XSS (CWE-79) fits into this chain.\n\nCWE-79 is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability ultimately leads to a bypass of CSRF protection, which can be exploited through a crafted URL, effectively resulting in a form of cross-site scripting. The lack of sanitization and encoding are contributing factors, but the end result aligns most closely with the characteristics of CWE-79.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
