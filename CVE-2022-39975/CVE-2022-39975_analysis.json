However, since the description explicitly states that the system **does not check user permission**, CWE-862 is a more accurate and specific classification than its parent. CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** was also considered but not selected as the system **does not check** which indicates a missing check, rather than an incorrect check. CWE-668 was added as a secondary mapping candidate, with the rationale that the unpublished content pages are being exposed to the wrong sphere (unauthorized users).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of the following:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing Authorization** (CWE-862) - The Layout module **does not check user permission** before showing the preview.\n2.  **Impact:** Information Disclosure - Attackers can view unpublished Content Page pages.\nThe chain is relatively direct, with the missing authorization leading directly to information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **root cause** identified in the vulnerability description: the Layout module **does not check user permission** before showing the preview. This immediately suggested CWE-862 **Missing Authorization**. The retriever results and complete CWE specifications were then reviewed to validate this choice.\n\nThe primary CWE is based on the evidence that the system **does not check** permissions:\n> The Layout module in Liferay Portal v7.3.3 through v7.4.3.34, and Liferay DXP 7.3 before update 10, and 7.4 before update 35 **does not check user permission before showing the preview of a Content Page type page**\n\nThe relationship analysis confirmed that CWE-862 is a child of CWE-285 **Improper Authorization**, but the more specific **Missing Authorization** is more appropriate.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability as described.\nThe additional CWE-668 reflects the impact of the vulnerability, with the unpublished content pages being exposed to unauthorized users.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.392\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
