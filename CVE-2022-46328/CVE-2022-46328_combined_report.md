## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **"input validation vulnerability"** in smartphones, which is the root cause. The **lack of proper input validation** leads to a potential compromise of **"data confidentiality"**. This is the direct impact of the vulnerability.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and associated information. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions an **"input validation vulnerability"** as the root cause, which directly maps to CWE-20: Improper Input Validation. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" also supports this, stating the **"Root Cause: Input verification vulnerabilities."**

The retriever results also list CWE-20 as a candidate. Although CWE-20 is discouraged for direct mapping due to its generality, the provided information does not sufficiently specify the *type* of input validation issue, so a more specific mapping isn't possible. The retriever results also provided CWE-1284 and CWE-1286.

The graph relationships influenced the final selection by guiding the search for more specific CWEs related to input validation. While a more specific CWE would be preferred, there is not sufficient evidence to use it as the primary CWE. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity given the available information.

## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product receives input or data, but it does
        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the
        properties that are required to process the data safely and
        correctly.

### Extended Description


Input validation is a frequently-used technique for checking potentially dangerous inputs in order to ensure that the inputs are safe for processing within the code, or when communicating with other components. When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.


Input validation is not the only technique for processing input, however. Other techniques attempt to transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well (see CWE-138 for more examples.)


Input validation can be applied to:


  - raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.

  - metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size

Data can be simple or structured. Structured data can be composed of many nested layers, composed of combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or structured data.

Many properties of raw data or metadata may need to be validated upon entry into the code, such as:


  - specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.

  - implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size

  - indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures

  - symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.

  - well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax 

  - lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token

  - specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)

  - consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.

  - conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic 

  - equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same

  - authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data

Implied or derived properties of data must often be calculated or inferred by the code itself. Errors in deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor to improper input validation. 

Note that "input validation" has very different meanings to different people, or within different classification schemes. Caution must be used when referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it. For example, some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control to an attacker over an input when they should not be able to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred to as input validation.


Finally, it is important to emphasize that the distinctions between input validation and output escaping are often blurred, and developers must be careful to understand the difference, including how input validation is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a query. The name "O'Reilly" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, this valid name cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the "'" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis. It is also a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Consider lower-level children such as Improper Use of Validation Framework (CWE-1173) or improper validation involving specific types or properties of input such as Specified Quantity (CWE-1284); Specified Index, Position, or Offset (CWE-1285); Syntactic Correctness (CWE-1286); Specified Type (CWE-1287); Consistency within Input (CWE-1288); or Unsafe Equivalence (CWE-1289).
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-1284: Specified Quantity
- CWE-1285: Specified Index, Position, or Offset
- CWE-1286: Syntactic Correctness
- CWE-1287: Specified Type
- CWE-1288: Consistency within Input
- CWE-1289: Unsafe Equivalence
- CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

CWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.


**[Maintenance]** As of 2020, this entry is used more often than preferred, and it is a source of frequent confusion. It is being actively modified for CWE 4.1 and subsequent versions.

**[Maintenance]** Concepts such as validation, data transformation, and neutralization are being refined, so relationships between CWE-20 and other entries such as CWE-707 may change in future versions, along with an update to the Vulnerability Theory document.

**[Maintenance]** Input validation - whether missing or incorrect - is such an essential and widespread part of secure development that it is implicit in many different weaknesses. Traditionally, problems such as buffer overflows and XSS have been classified as input validation problems by many security professionals. However, input validation is not necessarily the only protection mechanism available for avoiding such problems, and in some cases it is not even sufficient. The CWE team has begun capturing these subtleties in chains within the Research Concepts view (CWE-1000), but more work is needed.

**[Terminology]** 

The "input validation" term is extremely common, but it is used in many different ways. In some cases its usage can obscure the real underlying weakness or otherwise hide chaining and composite relationships.


Some people use "input validation" as a general term that covers many different neutralization techniques for ensuring that input is appropriate, such as filtering, canonicalization, and escaping. Others use the term in a more narrow context to simply mean "checking if an input conforms to expectations without changing it." CWE uses this more narrow interpretation.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)
- **CVE-2021-30860:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) leads to integer overflow (CWE-190) in mobile OS, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.

- **CVE-2008-1440:** lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop
- **CVE-2008-2374:** lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read




## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.

### Extended Description


Often, complex inputs are expected to follow a particular syntax, which is either assumed by the input itself, or declared within metadata such as headers. The syntax could be for data exchange formats, markup languages, or even programming languages. When untrusted input is not properly validated for the expected syntax, attackers could cause parsing failures, trigger unexpected errors, or expose latent vulnerabilities that might not be directly exploitable if the input had conformed to the syntax.

- **CVE-2007-5893:** HTTP request with missing protocol version number leads to crash




## CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product acts as an intermediary HTTP agent
         (such as a proxy or firewall) in the data flow between two
         entities such as a client and server, but it does not
         interpret malformed HTTP requests or responses in ways that
         are consistent with how the messages will be processed by
         those entities that are at the ultimate destination.

### Extended Description


HTTP requests or responses ("messages") can be malformed or unexpected in ways that cause web servers or clients to interpret the messages in different ways than intermediary HTTP agents such as load balancers, reverse proxies, web caching proxies, application firewalls, etc. For example, an adversary may be able to add duplicate or different header fields that a client or server might interpret as one set of messages, whereas the intermediary might interpret the same sequence of bytes as a different set of messages. For example, discrepancies can arise in how to handle duplicate headers like two Transfer-encoding (TE) or two Content-length (CL), or the malicious HTTP message will have different headers for TE and CL.


The inconsistent parsing and interpretation of messages can allow the adversary to "smuggle" a message to the client/server without the intermediary being aware of it.


This weakness is usually the result of the usage of outdated or incompatible HTTP protocol versions in the HTTP agents.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** Request smuggling can be performed due to a multiple interpretation error, where the target is an intermediary or monitor, via a consistency manipulation (Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length headers).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24766:** SSL/TLS-capable proxy allows HTTP smuggling when used in tandem with HTTP/1.0 services, due to inconsistent interpretation and input sanitization of HTTP messages within the body of another message
- **CVE-2021-37147:** Chain: caching proxy server has improper input validation (CWE-20) of headers, allowing HTTP response smuggling (CWE-444) using an "LF line ending"
- **CVE-2020-8287:** Node.js platform allows request smuggling via two Transfer-Encoding headers




## CWE-927: Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The Android application uses an implicit intent for transmitting sensitive data to other applications.

### Extended Description


Since an implicit intent does not specify a particular application to receive the data, any application can process the intent by using an Intent Filter for that intent. This can allow untrusted applications to obtain sensitive data. There are two variations on the standard broadcast intent, ordered and sticky.


Ordered broadcast intents are delivered to a series of registered receivers in order of priority as declared by the Receivers. A malicious receiver can give itself a high priority and cause a denial of service by stopping the broadcast from propagating further down the chain. There is also the possibility of malicious data modification, as a receiver may also alter the data within the Intent before passing it on to the next receiver. The downstream components have no way of asserting that the data has not been altered earlier in the chain.


Sticky broadcast intents remain accessible after the initial broadcast. An old sticky intent will be broadcast again to any new receivers that register for it in the future, greatly increasing the chances of information exposure over time. Also, sticky broadcasts cannot be protected by permissions that may apply to other kinds of intents.


In addition, any broadcast intent may include a URI that references data that the receiving component does not normally have the privileges to access. The sender of the intent can include special privileges that grant the receiver read or write access to the specific URI included in the intent. A malicious receiver that intercepts this intent will also gain those privileges and be able to read or write the resource at the specified URI.

## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.

### Extended Description


Code frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).

**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. "Resource exhaustion" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..
- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.




## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-118
ChildOf -> CWE-20

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist




## CWE-287: Improper Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
authentification: An alternate term is "authentification", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.
AuthN: "AuthN" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authentication" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from "AuthZ," which is an abbreviation of "authorization." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.
AuthC: "AuthC" is used as an abbreviation of "authentication," but it appears to used less frequently than "AuthN."

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).




## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.

### Extended Description
This weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.

### Alternative Terms
TOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to "Time Of Check To Time Of Use".
TOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-362
ChildOf -> CWE-362

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** TOCTOU issues do not always involve symlinks, and not every symlink issue is a TOCTOU problem.

**[Research Gap]** Non-symlink TOCTOU issues are not reported frequently, but they are likely to occur in code that attempts to be secure.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2015-1743:** TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed
- **CVE-2003-0813:** A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.
- **CVE-2004-0594:** PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.
