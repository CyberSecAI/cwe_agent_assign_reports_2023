## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **misconfiguration** of an invalid SAM file path, leading to **improper input validation** and **flawed logic** in the authentication process, ultimately resulting in an **authentication bypass**.

## Summary of Analysis
Initially, the high-level description suggested CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) might be appropriate, since the **authentication bypass** is the main **weakness**. However, the CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicates a more specific cause related to an invalid SAM file path. This led to considering CWE-289 (Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name) as a more precise mapping, given the misconfiguration acts as an "alternate name" allowing unauthorized access.

The decision is primarily based on the provided evidence, specifically the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" which states: "Specifically, if the server is configured with an invalid SAM file path, the authentication might succeed even with invalid credentials. This is due to an issue in how the `ntlm_fetch_ntlm_v2_hash` function handles lookups in the SAM database."

CWE-289 is chosen for its specificity, representing how an invalid SAM file path allows bypassing authentication. CWE-1390 is considered a broader classification, which is less specific and is related by the child-parent relationship. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) was considered but not used, because authentication *is* performed, but it can be bypassed due to the misconfiguration of the SAM file path. The optimal level of specificity is achieved by choosing CWE-289.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-24883

## Vulnerability Description
FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Prior to version 2.7.0, server side authentication against a `SAM` file might be successful for invalid credentials if the server has configured an invalid `SAM` file path. FreeRDP based clients are not affected. RDP server implementations using FreeRDP to authenticate against a `SAM` file are affected. Version 2.7.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, use custom authentication via `HashCallback` and/or ensure the `SAM` database path configured is valid and the application has file handles left.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **authentication bypass**
- **vector:** invalid SAM file
- **product:** FreeRDP
- **version:** prior to 2.7.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2022-24883:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the server-side authentication process of FreeRDP when using a Security Account Manager (SAM) file. Specifically, if the server is configured with an invalid SAM file path, the authentication might succeed even with invalid credentials. This is due to an issue in how the `ntlm_fetch_ntlm_v2_hash` function handles lookups in the SAM database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The code does not properly validate the configured path to the SAM database. It proceeds with the authentication process even if the specified path is invalid, leading to an authentication bypass.
- **Flawed Logic:** The logic in `ntlm_fetch_ntlm_v2_hash` appears to have an issue where it may still return a successful result even if the user lookup in the SAM database fails.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the RDP server by bypassing authentication using invalid credentials.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation would grant the attacker access to the resources and data available on the RDP server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed remotely via the RDP protocol.
- **Server Misconfiguration:** The vulnerability is triggered by a misconfiguration on the RDP server where an invalid SAM database path is set.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the vulnerable RDP server over the network.
- **RDP Client:** An RDP client is required to interact with the server.
- **Knowledge of Misconfiguration:** The attacker does not need to know valid usernames and passwords but needs to target a server that has an invalid path to the SAM database configured.

**Additional Notes:**
- FreeRDP-based clients are not directly affected. This vulnerability is on the server side, specifically for RDP server implementations that use FreeRDP for SAM file authentication.
- A fix for this issue was released in FreeRDP version 2.7.0.
- Workarounds include using custom authentication via `HashCallback` or ensuring the SAM database path is valid.
- The provided code diff shows changes to the `ntlm_fetch_ntlm_v2_hash` function in `winpr/libwinpr/sspi/NTLM/ntlm_compute.c`, which was part of the fix for this vulnerability

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses




## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

### Extended Description


Many file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as ".." and "/" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the "../" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as "/usr/local/bin" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.


### Alternative Terms
Directory traversal
Path traversal: "Path traversal" is preferred over "directory traversal," but both terms are attack-focused.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-706
ChildOf -> CWE-706
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add ".txt" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.

**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.

**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing "/" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).

**[Terminology]** 

Like other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use "directory traversal" only to refer to the injection of ".." and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.


Other variants like "absolute pathname" and "drive letter" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve ".." or equivalent.


**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.

**[Research Gap]** 

Incomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that "..\" is vulnerable, but not test "../" which may also be vulnerable.


Any combination of directory separators ("/", "\", etc.) and numbers of "." (e.g. "....") can produce unique variants; for example, the "//../" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama
- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the "\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)
