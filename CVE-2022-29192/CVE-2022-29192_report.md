## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-617 | Reachable Assertion | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-1284, is related to improper input validation, specifically concerning quantities. It's a child of CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) and can precede CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value). CWE-617, reachable assertion, represents the direct impact of the **missing** input validation, leading to a program crash due to the assertion failure.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing** input validation (CWE-1284) of the `input_min` and `input_max` tensors. Because the code does not ensure that those are scalar values when `axis` parameter is unspecified (-1), this leads to a `CHECK`-failure, which is an assertion that the application can reach which then leads to a Denial of Service.
- **Root Cause:** CWE-1284 - Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
- **Impact:** CWE-617 - Reachable Assertion leading to Denial of Service.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on the **missing** input validation and the resulting denial-of-service. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad` operation **does not fully validate** the input arguments. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause is the **lack of validation** on the `input_min` and `input_max` tensors, which leads to a `CHECK`-failure and a program crash.

The retriever results and similar CVE descriptions point strongly to CWE-1284, which aligns with the **missing validation** of the input quantities. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-1284 is a specific type of input validation issue (child of CWE-20).

The selection of CWE-1284 is based on the evidence that the vulnerability is caused by the **failure to validate** that the `input_min` and `input_max` tensors are scalars. This fits the description of CWE-1284, which concerns the improper validation of specified quantities in input. While the `CHECK`-failure could be classified as a more generic CWE related to errors, the root cause is specifically the input validation issue, making CWE-1284 the more appropriate choice as the primary CWE.

CWE-617 is considered a secondary CWE as it describes the impact of the vulnerability - a reachable assertion.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately capture the root cause and the immediate impact of the vulnerability. CWE-1284 identifies the specific type of input validation issue, while CWE-617 describes the direct consequence of that issue.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-606: Unchecked Input for Loop Condition
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly check inputs that are used for loop conditions, potentially leading to a denial of service or other consequences because of excessive looping.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains an iteration or loop with an exit condition that cannot be reached, i.e., an infinite loop.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.

## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. However, classification research is limited for weaknesses of this type, so there can be gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE that force use of this weakness, even at such a high level of abstraction.

## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Truncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
