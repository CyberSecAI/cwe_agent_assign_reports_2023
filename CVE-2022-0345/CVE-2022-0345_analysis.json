The \"Usage: Allowed\" mapping guidance supports this choice. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **missing CSRF check**, making this a suitable primary CWE.\n\nCWE-862 (Missing Authorization) addresses the missing authorization check. The \"Usage: Allowed-with-Review\" mapping guidance suggests examining its children for a better fit. However, no child CWE provides a more specific description of the authorization failure in this context.\n\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization) was considered but not chosen as it is discouraged by MITRE. CWE-862 is a child of CWE-285 and is more specific.\n\nCWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was considered because the impact is email address disclosure. However, the root cause is the **missing authorisation and CSRF check**, not the exposure itself, making it a less appropriate choice than CWE-352 and CWE-862.\n\nCWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) was considered as an alternative authorization weakness. However, the description doesn't quite match the vulnerability, as it is more about directly modifying a key to access other user's data. In this case, it is more about calling an AJAX action that should not be accessible without proper authorization.\n\nThe selected CWEs, CWE-352 and CWE-862, are at the optimal level of specificity, addressing both the CSRF and authorization aspects of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n- CWE-862: Missing Authorization",
