While it broadly applies given the **incorrect input validation** description, the guidance discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available. CWE-1286 **Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input** is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-20, offering a more specific classification that aligns better with the vulnerability description. The relationship indicates a move from general input issues to more specific syntactic issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe1286[\"CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\"]\n    \n    cwe1286 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe1286 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with **incorrect input validation** (CWE-20), leading to potential directory enumeration or DoS. The **insufficient input validation** allows for arbitrary directory creation and enumeration, ultimately resulting in data exposure or service disruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed to CWE-20 due to the **incorrect input validation**. However, the MITRE guidance advises against using this Class-level CWE when more specific alternatives exist. The retriever results suggested CWE-1286, which focuses on syntactic correctness. Although the description doesn't explicitly mention syntactic errors, the broader context of directory enumeration and crafted input suggests that the input is not validated against the expected syntax.\n\nThe vulnerability description states \"The foldername parameter in Bolt 5.1.7 was discovered to have **incorrect input validation**, allowing attackers to perform directory enumeration or cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted input.\"\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section states \"The vulnerability is due to **insufficient input validation** or sanitization in the application, allowing for arbitrary directory creation and enumeration.\"\n\nGiven the available evidence, CWE-20 is selected as the primary CWE, with CWE-1286 as a secondary CWE reflecting a more specific aspect of the input validation failure. This selection is based on the explicit mention of **incorrect input validation** and the potential for syntactic deviations in the crafted input.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
