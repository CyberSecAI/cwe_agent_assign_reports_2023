It is a child of CWE-311 (**CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data**). No chain relationships are relevant in this case. The base level of abstraction is appropriate because the application **fails to prevent users from connecting over unencrypted connections**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    \n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe311 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to prevent users from connecting over unencrypted connections**, leading to the transmission of sensitive information in cleartext. This allows an attacker to intercept and modify network traffic, bypassing SSL/TLS encryption, and potentially using the application as a platform for attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identifies the root cause as the **failure to prevent users from connecting over unencrypted connections**. The evidence for this is directly stated in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" as \"**rootcause:** **failure to prevent users from connecting over unencrypted connections**\" and in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" as \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to prevent users from connecting over unencrypted connections.\"\n\nThe Retriever Results list CWE-319 (**CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information**) as the top candidate, which aligns with the vulnerability description. The application's **failure to prevent users from connecting over unencrypted connections** directly leads to the transmission of sensitive information in cleartext. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-319 states that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities, and its Usage is Allowed.\n\nBased on the evidence and the CWE specifications, CWE-319 is the most appropriate and specific classification for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\nCWE-319 (**CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information**)\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-522 (**CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials**): While related to security, this is more about how credentials are stored/transmitted, not the lack of encryption.\n*   CWE-614 (**CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute**): This is related to cookies, which is not the primary issue in the described vulnerability.\n*   CWE-295 (**CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation**): This is about certificate validation, which is not the core issue here.\n*   CWE-327 (**CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm**): This is about the algorithm itself, not the absence of encryption.\n* CWE-649 (**CWE-649: Reliance on Obfuscation or Encryption of Security-Relevant Inputs without Integrity Checking**): The application is not performing checking of integrity.\n*   CWE-208 (**CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy**): Timing discrepancies are not relevant to the described vulnerability.\n*   CWE-757 (**CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')**): This is about downgrading algorithms, not the absence of encryption.\n*   CWE-923 (**CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints**): This is about restricting communication channels, not the absence of encryption.\n*   CWE-1204 (**CWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)**): Initialization vectors are not relevant to the described vulnerability.",
