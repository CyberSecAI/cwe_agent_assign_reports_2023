CWE-201 is a more specific case of CWE-200, where the sensitive information is actively sent to an unauthorized actor. CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is related as the information is sent without encryption. These relationships help refine the selection to the most accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe319 -->|RELATED| cwe201\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe319,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to strip the Authorization header on HTTP downgrade**, leading to **insertion of sensitive information into sent data**, and finally resulting in **account access exposure and compromise**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, several CWEs related to information exposure and authorization were considered. However, based on the detailed description, the core issue is the **failure to strip the Authorization header**, leading to it being sent in cleartext during an HTTP downgrade. This aligns directly with CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) as the primary weakness. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly states that the **failure to remove the Authorization header during an HTTP downgrade can lead to the exposure of sensitive authentication information.**\n\nThe selection of CWE-201 is further justified by its Base level of abstraction, which is preferred for mapping root causes. The mapping guidance for CWE-201 allows its usage and confirms that it fits the description of sensitive data being transmitted to another actor.\n\nCWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is considered as a secondary weakness as the failure to strip the header results in the sensitive information being transmitted in cleartext.\n\nOther CWEs like CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key), and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) were considered but deemed less appropriate as they address broader access control and authorization issues, whereas the vulnerability is specifically about the leakage of sensitive data during transmission due to the failure to strip the Authorization header during an HTTP downgrade.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
