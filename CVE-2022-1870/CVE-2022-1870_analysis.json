It is related to CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference), CWE-672 (Operation on a Resource after Expiration). CWE-416 can be preceded by CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input) and CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition). CWE-787 is a base CWE and can be preceded by CWE-825.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on a Resource after Expiration\"]\n\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe120 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe416\n    cwe123 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe416\n    cwe787 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe825\n    cwe825 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe787,cwe825,cwe120,cwe123,cwe672 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **use after free** (CWE-416) in the App Service of Google Chrome, potentially leading to **heap corruption**. The attacker exploits this through a crafted Chrome Extension.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points to CWE-416 as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description, key phrases, and CVE reference summary. The description clearly states \"**Use after free** in App Service\" as the root cause. The CVE reference links content summary confirms \"Root cause of vulnerability: Use after free\" and \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Use after free in App Service\".\n\nThe relationship graph and retriever results reinforce this assessment, with CWE-416 being a variant-level CWE.\n\nCWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is considered a secondary candidate because **heap corruption** is often a consequence of out-of-bounds write operations. However, the primary root cause identified is the **use after free**, so CWE-416 is the more accurate primary mapping.\n\nThe selection of CWE-416 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the **use after free** condition described in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* While a use-after-free could be related to improper resource shutdown, the vulnerability description specifically calls out the use of memory after it has been freed.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is not about sensitive information.\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* While race conditions can lead to use-after-free vulnerabilities, the description doesn't mention anything about threads.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* Improper locking could lead to memory corruption, but the description specifically calls out use-after-free.\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* See CWE-366\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
