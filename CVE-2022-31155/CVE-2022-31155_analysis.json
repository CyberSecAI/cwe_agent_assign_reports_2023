This is a child of CWE-284 Improper Access Control, which is a high-level Pillar. CWE-863 is more specific, as it describes a scenario where an authorization check is performed, but it's done incorrectly. The relationship informs the decision to choose the more specific CWE-863.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  A **bug in the authorization check** (CWE-863)\n2.  Leads to the ability for an attacker to delete other users' saved searches.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that there is a **bug in the authorization check**. This directly points to CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization. The vulnerability allows an attacker to delete other users' saved searches, which is a consequence of the authorization **bug**.\n\nThe evidence is strong, as the description explicitly mentions the authorization check issue: \"it is possible for an attacker to delete other users saved searches due to a **bug in the authorization check**.\"\n\nCWE-284: Improper Access Control was considered but is too general. While the vulnerability does involve access control, CWE-863 provides a more specific description of the problem \u2013 an incorrect authorization check, not a complete lack of access control. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-284 discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available.\n\nThe selection of CWE-863 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the root cause: a flawed authorization check.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
