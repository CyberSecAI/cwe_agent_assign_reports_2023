Matches the described **stack overflow** in the `snquote` function. |\n| CWE-674 | Uncontrolled Recursion | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary CWE. Could be the root cause if the stack overflow is caused by uncontrolled recursion. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-121, Stack-based Buffer Overflow, a variant of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion) is a class-level CWE and a child of CWE-834 (Excessive Iteration). If the stack overflow is caused by uncontrolled recursion, then CWE-674 would be the root cause, leading to CWE-121.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe674[\"CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\"]\n    cwe834[\"CWE-834: Excessive Iteration\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe674 -->|CHILDOF| cwe834\n    cwe121 -->|CANBE caused by| cwe674\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe674 secondary\n    class cwe787,cwe119,cwe834 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is: potentially CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion) -> CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow). If the **stack overflow** is due to uncontrolled recursion, then CWE-674 precedes CWE-121. Otherwise, the root cause may be something else, such as an off-by-one error or incorrect buffer size calculation within the `snquote` function.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is a **stack overflow** in the `snquote` function of Cesanta MJS v2.20.0. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**stack overflow** via snquote at mjs/src/mjs_json.c\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states that \"A **stack overflow** occurs due to an issue in the `snquote` function when processing a crafted JSON string, specifically within the `mjs_json.c` file at line 102.\" The Retriever Results list CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) as the top candidate with a score of 1.0.\n\nCWE-121 is a Variant-level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping. The description of CWE-121, \"A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function),\" accurately matches the vulnerability description.\n\nCWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion) is considered as a secondary CWE because the stack overflow may be caused by uncontrolled recursion in the `snquote` function. However, without more information, it is difficult to confirm. CWE-674 is a Class-level CWE, and the Mapping Guidance suggests examining children of this entry for a better fit.\n\nThe other CWEs listed in the Retriever Results (CWE-190, CWE-122, CWE-193, CWE-126, CWE-128, CWE-401, CWE-125, CWE-191) are not as directly relevant as CWE-121. While integer overflows (CWE-190) or off-by-one errors (CWE-193) could potentially contribute to a buffer overflow, the primary issue described is a **stack overflow**, making CWE-121 the most appropriate choice.\n\nThe final decision is based on the provided evidence and the relationships. Selecting CWE-121 is at the optimal level of specificity.",
