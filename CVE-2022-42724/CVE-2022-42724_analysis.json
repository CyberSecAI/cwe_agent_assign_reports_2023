CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a class-level CWE that could be related, representing a broader category of authorization issues. While CWE-863 is plausible, CWE-359 more directly reflects the vulnerability's root cause, which is the disclosure of role names. The final choice was driven by the specific information disclosure aspect, making CWE-359 the more accurate representation at a base level of abstraction.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe359 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing or incorrect authorization** check, leading to the **exposure of role names** to unauthorized users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a vulnerability in MISP where role names, intended to be restricted to site administrators, are being disclosed to non-site admin users. This constitutes an **exposure of sensitive information**. Additionally, organization administrators can assign roles intended for site admins to other users.\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section provides direct evidence: \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the disclosure of role names restricted to site administrators to non-site admin users.\" and \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** - **Information Disclosure:** Role names that should have been restricted to site administrators were being disclosed to non-site admin users.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is based on this direct evidence. This CWE accurately captures the nature of the vulnerability where role names (which can be considered private information in this context) are being exposed to unauthorized actors.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was considered, as the issue originates from authorization problems. However, CWE-359 is more specific and aligns directly with the **impact** of the vulnerability - the **disclosure of information**.\n\nTherefore, CWE-359 is the most accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability, aligning with the evidence provided.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
