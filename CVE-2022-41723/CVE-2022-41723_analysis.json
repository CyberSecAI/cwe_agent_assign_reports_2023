While CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is also a parent of CWE-405, CWE-407 more precisely captures the nature of the vulnerability related to algorithmic inefficiency. The vulnerability description details a specific algorithmic issue (quadratic complexity) rather than a general lack of resource control, making CWE-407 a more fitting choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    cwe405[\"CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe407 -->|CHILDOF| cwe405\n    cwe405 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe407 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **inefficient algorithmic complexity** in the HPACK decoder (CWE-407). This leads to **excessive CPU consumption**, and eventually results in a **denial of service (DoS)**. Therefore, the chain is: CWE-407 -> Excessive CPU Consumption -> DoS. CWE-400 is a high level abstraction of resource consumption that results from the vulnerability, but the more direct and specific cause is CWE-407.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nMy assessment is based on the provided evidence, particularly the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which states: \"A maliciously crafted HTTP/2 stream could cause **excessive CPU consumption** in the HPACK decoder. Specifically, when parsing a field literal containing two Huffman-encoded strings, the decoder would not verify all data is present before decoding the first string. This resulted in a **forced quadratic complexity** when repeatedly parsing a partial field, repeating the Huffman decoding of the string on each iteration.\"\n\nThe term \"quadratic complexity\" strongly suggests CWE-407 (Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity). The excessive CPU consumption is a direct consequence of this algorithmic inefficiency, leading to a denial-of-service.\n\nWhile CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is also relevant, it's a more general category. The specific weakness lies in the inefficient algorithm, making CWE-407 the primary and more precise classification. The relationship analysis further supports this, as CWE-407 is a child of CWE-405, which in turn is a child of CWE-400, indicating a more specific instance of resource consumption.\n\nI have chosen CWE-407 as the primary CWE because it identifies the root cause that led to the vulnerability where this issue has terms like \u201c**quadratic complexity**\u201d. The fact that there is a quadratic complexity issue is explicit evidence for the selection of CWE-407.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified
