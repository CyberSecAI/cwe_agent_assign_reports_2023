This allows an attacker to decrypt the credentials and gain unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the use of a hard-coded key. The vulnerability description mentions: \"Credentials for accessing this gateway are stored after being encrypted with the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode using a **hardcoded key**.\"\nThis is reinforced by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"The Motorola Solutions ACE1000 device communicates with an XRT Lan-to-radio gateway using an embedded client. The credentials for this gateway are stored after being encrypted with the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode using a **hardcoded key**.\"\n\nCWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) is also applicable because the description mentions the use of ECB encryption, which is known to be insecure. The use of ECB mode is explicitly called out in the \"Root Cause of Vulnerability\" and \"Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present\" sections of the CVE reference.\n\nCWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) is also relevant because a cryptographic key is a type of credential. The CWE specification for CWE-798 mentions: \"The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-321 as the primary CWE is based on the principle of selecting the most specific CWE that accurately represents the weakness. CWE-321 is a variant of CWE-798, making it more specific.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Selected:** The sensitive information is not stored in cleartext; it is stored encrypted, albeit with a weak method.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Why Not Selected:** Although the hardcoded key leads to weak credentials, it is better to focus on the root cause.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
