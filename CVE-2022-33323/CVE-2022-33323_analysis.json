CWE-287 is a Class level CWE, which has many child CWEs that are more specific.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe489[\"CWE-489: Active Debug Code\"]\n    cwe710[\"CWE-710: Insufficiently Protected Internal Information\"]\n    cwe215[\"CWE-215: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Debugging Code\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe489 -->|ChildOf| cwe710\n    cwe489 -->|CanPrecede| cwe215\n    cwe287 -->|ChildOf| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe489 primary\n    class cwe710,cwe215,cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause** of **active debug code** (CWE-489) leading to **authentication bypass** which then results in unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **authentication bypass** as the primary weakness. However, after a careful review of the evidence, the **root cause** is the **active debug code** (CWE-489), which directly enables the **authentication bypass**. The presence of active debug code is the underlying reason for the vulnerability.\n\nEvidence:\n\n*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**: **rootcause:** **authentication bypass**\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**: **Root cause of vulnerability**: Active debug code present in the Mitsubishi Electric MELFA SD/SQ series and F-series robot controllers. **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authentication bypass due to the active debug code, allowing unauthorized telnet login.\n\nThe graph relationships support the selection of CWE-489, as it is a base CWE and accurately represents the **root cause**.\n\nThe final decision to select CWE-489 is based on the evidence pointing to the presence of active debug code as the underlying cause of the **authentication bypass**. This CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the flaw in the system.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme

Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm,

abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication

Capture-replay\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 5780.03\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that
