A potential consequence of this **improper validation** is resource allocation without limits (CWE-770), which can lead to resource exhaustion (CWE-400). CWE-1284 can precede CWE-770, which is a child of CWE-400. The abstraction levels also influenced the selection. CWE-1284 and CWE-770 are base level, which is the preferred level, whereas CWE-400 is a class.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe770\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1284 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Insufficient bound checks** (translated to **improper validation** of input).\n2.  **Weakness:** Inadequate control over resource allocation, potentially leading to excessive resource consumption.\n3.  **Impact:** Denial of resources and/or possibly denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **insufficient bound checks** as the root cause, leading to potential denial of resources. The analysis focused on mapping this root cause to the most appropriate CWE.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**insufficient bound checks** in the System Management Unit (SMU) may result in a system voltage malfunction that could result in denial of resources and/or possibly denial of service.\"\n\nBased on the retriever results, CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) was selected as the primary CWE. The SMU likely handles voltage settings, which are quantities. **Insufficient bound checks** can be interpreted as **improper validation** of these quantities. The other top CWEs, such as CWE-119 and CWE-20, are considered too general. CWE-1284 aligns well with the vulnerability's description and the concept of validating quantities related to system voltage.\n\nCWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) was considered a secondary CWE because the improper validation of quantities could lead to excessive resource allocation. This is a reasonable potential consequence of the **insufficient bound checks**.\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) was considered as a possible impact as the **insufficient bound checks** could lead to denial of service.\n\nThe final selection prioritizes the root cause (**improper validation**) while also acknowledging potential consequences (resource allocation issues and denial of service). The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-1284 providing the most accurate representation of the **insufficient bound checks** in the SMU.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Rejected:* This CWE doesn't fit as the input isn't necessarily a resource identifier.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Rejected:* The description does not suggest the presence of a protection mechanism.\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
