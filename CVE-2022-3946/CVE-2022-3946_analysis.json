CWE-352 is a compound weakness that requires multiple conditions to be met, while CWE-862 is a Class-level weakness. Both CWEs are related to security checks that are not implemented in the vulnerable code. There isn't a direct parent-child relationship between these two, but they both contribute to the overall vulnerability. The abstraction levels influenced the selection by preferring the more specific Compound CWE-352 and Class CWE-862 over more abstract Pillar CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n\n    cwe352 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe345 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of weaknesses starts with the **missing authorization** and **missing CSRF check** in the AJAX action. This leads to a logged-in user being able to create, update, and delete shipping methods, ultimately impacting the e-commerce functionality.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-352 and CWE-862 as the most relevant CWEs based on the vulnerability description and the provided \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\". The key phrases \"missing authorisation and CSRF check\" directly support these mappings. The graph relationships helped to understand the context of these weaknesses within broader security concepts. The selected CWEs are at an optimal level of specificity, representing the specific flaws in the code.\n\nThe assessment is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\".\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n## Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n## CWE-424: Improper Protection of Alternate Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently protect all possible paths that a user can take to access restricted functionality or resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
