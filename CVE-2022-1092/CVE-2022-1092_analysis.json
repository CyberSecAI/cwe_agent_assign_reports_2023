While CWE-284 is a high-level Pillar, CWE-862 is a more specific Class that directly addresses the **lack of authorization** checks. CWE-352 (**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**) is also relevant due to the **lack of CSRF checks**. CWE-359 (**Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor**) is considered because the **lack of authorization** leads to the **retrieval of email addresses**, which constitutes private information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe352 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe352,cwe359 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of authorization and CSRF checks** in the `mycred-tools-import-export` AJAX action. This **missing authorization** allows any authenticated user to access the action, leading to the **exposure of email addresses**. The **missing CSRF check** allows for potential CSRF attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **lack of authorization** which directly maps to CWE-862 (**Missing Authorization**). The vulnerability description clearly states \"The myCred WordPress plugin before 2.4.3.1 does not have authorisation and CSRF checks in its mycred-tools-import-export AJAX action, allowing any authenticated user to call and and retrieve the list of email address present in the blog\". This maps directly to the definition of **Missing Authorization** where \"The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\" Additionally, the **lack of CSRF checks** maps to CWE-352 (**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**), and the **retrieval of email addresses** aligns with CWE-359 (**Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor**).\n\nThe graph relationships support the selection of CWE-862 as the primary CWE, as it is a more specific child of the high-level CWE-284 (**Improper Access Control**). While CWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**) is a parent of CWE-862, CWE-862 is more precise in describing the **missing authorization** check.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-862 is a Class, which is more specific than the Pillar CWE-284. CWE-352 is a Compound, reflecting the combination of weaknesses required for a CSRF attack, and CWE-359 is a Base that directly identifies the **exposure of personal information**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
