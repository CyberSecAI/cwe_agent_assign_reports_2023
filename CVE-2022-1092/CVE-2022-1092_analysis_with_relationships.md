# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2022-1092

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 1.0 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE |
| CWE-352 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | 1.0 | Compound | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-359 | Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-862, **Missing Authorization**, which is a child of both CWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**) and CWE-284 (**Improper Access Control**). While CWE-284 is a high-level Pillar, CWE-862 is a more specific Class that directly addresses the **lack of authorization** checks. CWE-352 (**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**) is also relevant due to the **lack of CSRF checks**. CWE-359 (**Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor**) is considered because the **lack of authorization** leads to the **retrieval of email addresses**, which constitutes private information.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of authorization and CSRF checks** in the `mycred-tools-import-export` AJAX action. This **missing authorization** allows any authenticated user to access the action, leading to the **exposure of email addresses**. The **missing CSRF check** allows for potential CSRF attacks.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on the **lack of authorization** which directly maps to CWE-862 (**Missing Authorization**). The vulnerability description clearly states "The myCred WordPress plugin before 2.4.3.1 does not have authorisation and CSRF checks in its mycred-tools-import-export AJAX action, allowing any authenticated user to call and and retrieve the list of email address present in the blog". This maps directly to the definition of **Missing Authorization** where "The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action." Additionally, the **lack of CSRF checks** maps to CWE-352 (**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**), and the **retrieval of email addresses** aligns with CWE-359 (**Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor**).

The graph relationships support the selection of CWE-862 as the primary CWE, as it is a more specific child of the high-level CWE-284 (**Improper Access Control**). While CWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**) is a parent of CWE-862, CWE-862 is more precise in describing the **missing authorization** check.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-862 is a Class, which is more specific than the Pillar CWE-284. CWE-352 is a Compound, reflecting the combination of weaknesses required for a CSRF attack, and CWE-359 is a Base that directly identifies the **exposure of personal information**.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. This is often a component in phishing attacks.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale:
