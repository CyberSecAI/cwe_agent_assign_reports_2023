This is a base-level CWE, providing sufficient specificity. CWE-119 is a broader class that encompasses out-of-bounds access, but CWE-823 is more specific. The relationships of CWE-823 with other CWEs such as CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) and CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as potential consequences further solidify the choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe823[\"CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe823 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe823 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe125\n    cwe823 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe823 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe125,cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of out-of-range pointer offset** (CWE-823), which leads to memory corruption. The specific type of memory corruption (read or write) is not explicitly stated, but both CWE-125 and CWE-787 are possibilities.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly pointed to CWE-823 due to the direct match in the vulnerability description: \"**use of out-of-range pointer offset**\". The retriever results also listed CWE-823 as a highly relevant candidate. The relationship analysis further supports this selection, as CWE-823 is a base-level CWE that accurately represents the weakness.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions the **use of out-of-range pointer offset**. This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-823.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability. While CWE-119 is a broader category, CWE-823 provides a more precise classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially

Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.\n\n\n\n## CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6918.96\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations for the resulting pointer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This",
