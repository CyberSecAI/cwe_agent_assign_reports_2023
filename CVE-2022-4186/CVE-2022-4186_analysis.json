CWE-20 has a hierarchical relationship with CWE-1284 (ChildOf) and CWE-113 (ChildOf). CWE-494 is a base level weakness and a child of CWE-345 and CWE-669.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe494[\"CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    cwe669[\"CWE-669: Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres\"]\n\n    cwe1284 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe494 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    cwe494 -->|CHILDOF| cwe669\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe494 secondary\n    class cwe1284,cwe113,cwe345,cwe669 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient validation of untrusted input** (CWE-20), leading to the ability of an attacker to bypass download restrictions. A crafted HTML page is used as the attack vector.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **insufficient validation of untrusted input** as the root cause, which directly aligns with CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation). The vulnerability description clearly states that the **insufficient validation** allowed an attacker to bypass download restrictions, confirming that **improper input validation** is the weakness.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by providing context on how **improper input validation** can lead to other vulnerabilities. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-20 captures the general **improper input validation**, while CWE-494 identifies the specific consequence of downloading code without integrity check that is not validated sufficiently.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is: \"**Insufficient validation of untrusted input** in Downloads in Google Chrome prior to 108.0.5359.71 allowed an attacker who convinced a user to install a malicious extension to bypass Downloads restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\"\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
