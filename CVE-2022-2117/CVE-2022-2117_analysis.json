While it's discouraged for direct mapping due to its generality, in this case, there's no more specific variant available that directly captures the **exposure of sensitive donor information** via the REST API. The secondary CWEs, CWE-306 and CWE-862, highlight the **missing authentication** and **authorization checks**, respectively, that led to this exposure. They are related as contributing factors to the primary weakness. CWE-306 and CWE-862 are children of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), but are more specific.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    cwe862 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of authentication (CWE-306) and authorization (CWE-862)** on the `/donor-wall` REST API endpoint. This leads to the **exposure of sensitive donor information (CWE-200)** to unauthenticated users. The chain highlights how the missing security checks directly result in the information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the resulting impact. The key phrase \"sensitive information disclosure\" immediately pointed to CWE-200. However, the retriever results and the vulnerability description key phrases also highlighted the absence of authentication and authorization. Therefore, CWE-306 and CWE-862 were considered as contributing factors.\n\nThe relationship graph confirmed that CWE-306 and CWE-862 can precede CWE-200, indicating that the missing checks led to the information exposure. While CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE, it is the most appropriate in this scenario because the vulnerability is centered around the **exposure of sensitive information** without proper access controls. The evidence supporting this decision comes directly from the vulnerability description: \"provides unauthenticated users with donor information even when the donor wall is not enabled.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-200, CWE-306, and CWE-862 represents the optimal level of specificity, capturing both the root cause (missing checks) and the resulting impact (information disclosure). The confidence score is high due to the clear alignment between the vulnerability description, the retriever results, and the CWE specifications.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Analysis:** This CWE was considered, but it doesn't directly apply because the vulnerability doesn't involve placing sensitive information into files or directories. Instead, it's about exposing information through an API endpoint.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Analysis:** This CWE was considered, but it doesn't fit because the vulnerability is not about transmitting information in cleartext. It's about exposing information without proper authorization.\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Analysis:** This CWE was considered, but it doesn't apply because the vulnerability isn't about storing information in cleartext.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Analysis:** This CWE was considered, but it doesn't apply because the vulnerability isn't related to resource reuse.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Analysis:** This CWE was considered, but it is more specific to system information. The donor information is not necessarily system information.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Analysis:** This CWE was considered, but it doesn't apply because the vulnerability is about exposing information without authorization, not about failing to remove it.\n\n## CWE-213: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product's intended functionality exposes information to certain actors in accordance with the developer's security policy, but this information is regarded as sensitive according to the intended security policies of other stakeholders such as the product's administrator, users, or others whose information is being processed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Analysis:** This CWE doesn't apply because there is no mention of incompatible policies.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n**Analysis:** While related, CWE-668 is too general. The more specific CWE",
