# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2021-30761

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-416, which is a Variant of CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference) and CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiration). CWE-416 can precede CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size) and CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition). CWE-119 is a Class that is related to buffer management issues, and is a parent of CWE-416 through CWE-825. The choice of CWE-416 is due to the explicit mention of "use-after-free" in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, making it the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **use-after-free** condition (CWE-416) in WebKit, triggered by processing maliciously crafted web content. This can lead to **memory corruption**, and ultimately, arbitrary code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary focus is on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability based on the available evidence. The **Vulnerability Description** mentions a **memory corruption** issue. However, the **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** provides a more specific root cause: a **use-after-free** issue in WebKit.

The retriever results also list several potential CWEs, with CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) having the highest score. However, the explicit mention of "use-after-free" in the CVE summary makes CWE-416 a more accurate and specific classification.

CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is considered as a secondary CWE due to its general nature and relationship to memory corruption issues, serving as a parent to the specific CWE-416 through CWE-825.

The final decision is based on the principle of selecting the most specific CWE that accurately represents the vulnerability, supported by the evidence from the CVE summary and the relationships between CWEs.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected as there was no evidence of sensitive information being left in memory after a release.*

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*This CWE was not selected as there was no evidence of locking issues in the description.*

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*This CWE was not selected as the issue is using memory after it's freed.*

## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
If two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected as there was no evidence of a race condition.*

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected as there was no evidence of input validation issues.*

## CWE-665: Improper Initialization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

*This CWE was not selected as the issue is using memory after it's freed, not uninitialized memory.*

## CWE-415: Double Free
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected as the issue is using memory after it's freed only once, not freed twice.*

## CWE-416: Use After Free
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory "belongs" to the code that operates on the new pointer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was selected as the primary weakness.*

## CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code uses a variable that has not been initialized, leading to unpredictable or unintended results.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
