This CWE can lead to resource allocation issues. In this case, it leads to a DoS condition due to the **improper handling of the length parameter**. The secondary CWE is CWE-770 (**Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**), which is a Class-level CWE and a potential consequence of CWE-130 if the **improper handling** leads to uncontrolled resource consumption.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe130[\"CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe130\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe130 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency** (CWE-130), which allows an attacker to send malicious crafted packets. This leads to a denial-of-service condition (DoS) because the software may allocate resources without limits (CWE-770).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-130 as the primary weakness. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section explicitly mentions \"**Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency**\" as the **rootcause**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also states that \"The vulnerability stems from the **Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency** (CWE-130)\". This aligns perfectly with the CWE-130 description, which discusses how **inconsistent length parameters** can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially malicious outcomes.\n\nThe retriever results also strongly support CWE-130 as the primary candidate.\n\nCWE-770 was considered as a potential secondary weakness since **Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency** (CWE-130) could potentially lead to uncontrolled resource allocation. The \"impact\" is DoS, which can be related to the **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling** (CWE-770).\n\nThe final decision is to select CWE-130 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of it being the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity
