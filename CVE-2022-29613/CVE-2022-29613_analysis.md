# Analysis for CVE-2022-29613

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.8 | Class | Primary | Discouraged |
| CWE-639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE identified is CWE-20 (**CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**). This is a Class-level CWE, and the mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available. CWE-20 is a parent of CWE-1284 (**CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input**), which could be a more specific alternative. However, the description doesn't explicitly mention the type of input that is not validated, making CWE-20 the most applicable, albeit discouraged, choice. CWE-639 (**CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key**) is considered a secondary CWE, as the **insufficient input validation** allows an attacker to potentially modify user-controlled keys to bypass authorization. CWE-639 is a child of CWE-863 (**CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization**).

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient input validation** (CWE-20), which allows an attacker to alter the employee number. This leads to an authorization bypass (CWE-639), ultimately resulting in the attacker being able to view personal details of other users, causing a limited impact on confidentiality.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified CWE-20 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of **insufficient input validation** in the vulnerability description. The description states, "Due to **insufficient input validation**, SAP Employee Self Service allows an authenticated attacker with user privileges to alter employee number." The retriever results also list CWE-20 as the top result. However, the mapping guidance for CWE-20 discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available. After reviewing the other candidate CWEs, CWE-1284 (**CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input**) was considered, but ultimately not selected as the primary CWE because the type of input that is not validated is not specified. CWE-639 (**CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key**) was selected as a secondary CWE because the altered employee number can be considered a user-controlled key that bypasses authorization. The graph relationships helped to understand the potential chain of vulnerabilities, starting from input validation to authorization bypass. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity given the available information in the vulnerability description.
Relevant CWE Information:
# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:
## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.
## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.
## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction
