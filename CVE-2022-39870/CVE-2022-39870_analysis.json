CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) is a very high-level Pillar, making CWE-927 a more specific and appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe927[\"CWE-927: Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe927 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    cwe927 -->|ChildOf| cwe668\n    cwe285 -->|ChildOf| cwe284\n    cwe668 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe927 primary\n    class cwe284,cwe285,cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control** due to the use of implicit intents, leading to the **exposure of sensitive information**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the vulnerability is caused by **improper access control**. The key phrase \"improper access control\" in the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** and the **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** directly support this. Additionally, the use of implicit broadcasts as the attack vector further clarifies the nature of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-927 (Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication) is selected as the primary CWE because it specifically addresses the use of implicit intents in Android applications for transmitting sensitive data, which aligns directly with the vulnerability description. The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** mentions the use of implicit broadcasts, which confirms this mapping.\n\nCWE-284 (Improper Access Control) was considered but not selected as the primary CWE because it is a high-level Pillar and less specific than CWE-927. While the vulnerability does involve **improper access control**, CWE-927 provides a more precise classification by focusing on the root cause related to implicit intents.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
