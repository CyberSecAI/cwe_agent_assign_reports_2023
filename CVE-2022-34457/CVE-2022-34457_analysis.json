CWE-732 has two child relationships to CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere). The secondary CWE is CWE-276, which is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-732. The relationships influenced the selection by providing a more granular view of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe276[\"CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions\"]\n\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe276 -->|CHILDOF| cwe732\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe732 primary\n    class cwe276 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe668 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper folder permission** (root cause), which leads to a non-admin user being able to modify files, resulting in privilege escalation and application unavailability (impact).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **improper folder permission** as the root cause, leading to privilege escalation. The vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary both clearly point to an access control issue.\n\nThe selection of CWE-732 is based on the evidence: \"**improper folder permission** when installed not to default path but to non-secured path which leads to privilege escalation\" and \"A local low-privileged attacker can modify files inside the installed directory.\" CWE-732's description, \"The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors,\" aligns well with this.\n\nThe relationships influenced the selection by pointing to a more specific Base CWE of CWE-276. CWE-276's description, \"During installation, installed file permissions are set to allow anyone to modify those files,\" matches the **improper folder permission** at installation.\n\nCWE-732 is the primary CWE because it directly addresses the **incorrect permission assignment** for a critical resource, as stated in the vulnerability description. CWE-276 is the secondary CWE because it explains when the **incorrect permission assignment** occurs during installation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
