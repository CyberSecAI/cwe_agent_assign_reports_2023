CWE-787 is related to CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), but the description provides enough details to use the more specific CWE-787. CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) and CWE-823 (Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset) were also considered because they are related to memory access issues. CWE-1285 (Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input) was also considered because the root cause is an **improper boundary check**, which means the index, position, or offset was not properly validated.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe823[\"CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset\"]\n    cwe1285[\"CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe823 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe823 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    cwe1285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe125,cwe823,cwe1285,cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **improper boundary check** in the UWB firmware, leading to an out-of-bounds write.\n\nRoot Cause: **Improper boundary check**\nWeakness: CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write\nImpact: Arbitrary memory write\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the provided CVE reference content summary.
