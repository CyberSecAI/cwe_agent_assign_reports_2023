There are no specific child or parent relationships that are relevant in this case. No chain relationships are present because this is the root cause vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe502 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is very simple:\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-502 - Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n2.  **Impact:** Remote Code Execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed towards CWE-502 due to the explicit mention of **Java deserialization** in the vulnerability description. The retriever results also listed CWE-502 as the top candidate.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"ForgeRock AM server before 7.0 has a **Java deserialization** vulnerability in the jato.pageSession parameter on multiple pages. The exploitation does not require authentication, and remote code execution can be triggered by sending a single crafted /ccversion/* request to the server. The vulnerability exists due to the usage of Sun ONE Application Framework (JATO) found in versions of Java 8 or earlier\"\n\nBased on the provided evidence and the high confidence in the initial assessment, CWE-502 is the optimal choice. All other CWEs were considered but deemed less relevant as they describe related but distinct weaknesses. CWE-502 directly addresses the core issue of deserializing untrusted data, making it the most specific and accurate classification for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nMarshaling, Unmarshaling: Marshaling and unmarshaling are effectively synonyms for serialization and deserialization, respectively.\nPickling, Unpickling: In Python, the \"pickle\" functionality is used to perform serialization and deserialization.\nPHP Object Injection: Some PHP application researchers use this term when attacking unsafe use of the unserialize() function; but it is also used for CWE-915.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-913\nChildOf -> CWE-913\nPeerOf -> CWE-915\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationships between CWE-502 and CWE-915 need further exploration. CWE-915 is more narrowly scoped to object modification, and is not necessarily used for deserialization.\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-12799:** chain: bypass of untrusted deserialization issue (CWE-502) by using an assumed-trusted class (CWE-183)\n- **CVE-2015-8103:** Deserialization issue in commonly-used Java library allows remote execution.\n- **CVE-2015-4852:** Deserialization issue in commonly-used Java library allows remote execution.",
