It falls under the broader category of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), a Pillar-level CWE. However, due to the specificity of the **incorrect authorization** mechanism described in the vulnerability, CWE-863 is chosen over CWE-284.\n\nCWE-863 has child CWEs that could be more specific, but the provided description does not give enough information to confidently select one of them. CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) is related, but the description doesn't explicitly state that the key is user-controlled.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is considered as a secondary CWE since the **impact** of the **inadequate authorization** is the exposure of sensitive information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe200 -->|IMPACT| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause** of **inadequate authorization** (**incorrect authorization**), which leads to the **impact** of sensitive information being accessible to unauthorized actors.\n\nInadequate Authorization (CWE-863) -> Exposure of Sensitive Information (CWE-200)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **root cause** described as \"**inadequate authorization for database query function**.\" The analysis considered several CWEs from the Retriever Results, including CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key), and CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor).\n\nThe primary selection, CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), is based on the description aligning with the **incorrect authorization** mechanism in the database query function. The vulnerability description key phrases confirm this: \"**rootcause: inadequate authorization for database query function**\"\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is added as a secondary weakness to represent the **impact** of the **incorrect authorization**. While CWE-200 is discouraged for representing root causes, it is appropriate here to capture the result of the vulnerability.\n\nThe CWEs are chosen at the most specific level supported by the provided evidence.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-202: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen trying to keep information confidential, an attacker can often infer some of the information by using statistics.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
