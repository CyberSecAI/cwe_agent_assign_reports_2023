The vulnerability description states that tokens are stored in plaintext, which directly matches the CWE's description. |\n| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability description says the plaintext tokens are exposed in read/write mode via the API. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship considered was the child-parent relationship between CWE-312 and its parent CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) and CWE-922 (Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information). CWE-312 is a more specific case of these broader categories, making it a better fit. CWE-201 is in a CanAlsoBe relationship with CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information) and CWE-202 (Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries), which highlights the potential for sensitive data leakage.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe922[\"CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe202[\"CWE-202: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries\"]\n\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe922\n    cwe201 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe209\n    cwe201 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe202\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n    class cwe311,cwe922,cwe209,cwe202 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper token storage** (CWE-312)\n2.  **Impact:** Tokens exposed in read/write mode via API (CWE-201)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **improper token storage** as the primary weakness. The Retriever Results suggested CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) and CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) as potential candidates. The final decision was heavily influenced by the direct match between the vulnerability description and the CWE-312 description. The fact that the tokens are exposed via the API is why CWE-201 was added as a secondary CWE.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision comes directly from the vulnerability description: \"The collection remote for pulp_ansible stores tokens in plaintext instead of using pulps encrypted field and exposes them in read/write mode via the API.\"\n\nCWE-312 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the storage of sensitive information in cleartext. While CWE-522 is related, it's a more general class of weakness, and CWE-312 provides a more precise characterization of the issue.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password): While related, this is specifically for passwords, whereas the vulnerability description refers to tokens, which may have different characteristics.\n*   CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials): Considered but deemed too general compared to CWE-312.\n*   CWE-922 (Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information): Considered, but CWE-312 is a more specific instance of this class.",
