CWE-285, \"Improper Authorization\" is also a child of CWE-284. The relationship shows a progression from a high-level access control issue to a more specific authorization problem. CWE-863 is chosen because the vulnerability description specifies that the access control mechanism is present but is performed incorrectly.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the root cause of **improper access control**, specifically an **incorrect authorization** mechanism. This leads to the impact of a local attacker being able to scan and connect to a PC via an unprotected binder call.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **improper access control** as the root cause, based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary. The retriever results suggested CWE-285, \"Improper Authorization,\" but the description also indicates the authorization is incorrectly performed. Thus, CWE-863, \"Incorrect Authorization,\" a more specific child of CWE-284 is more appropriate.\n\nThe selection of CWE-863 is based on the following evidence:\n*   \"Improper access control vulnerability\" - Vulnerability Description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary\n*   \"allows local attackers to scan and connect to PC by unprotected binder call\" - Vulnerability Description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary\n\nCWE-285 and CWE-284 were considered but deemed too high-level. The decision is supported by the MITRE mapping guidance, which discourages the use of high-level CWEs when more specific options exist.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\nNot selected, as the vulnerability is related to improper authorization, not insertion of sensitive information.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\nNot selected, as the vulnerability is related to improper authorization, not exposure of system information.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\nNot selected, as the vulnerability is related to improper authorization, not reuse of sensitive information.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\nNot selected because it is too high level of an abstraction and other options were available.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\nNot selected, as the vulnerability is related to incorrect authorization, not the handling of insufficient privileges.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\nNot selected, as the vulnerability is related to incorrect authorization, not the handling of insufficient permissions or privileges.\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\nNot selected because it is too high level of an abstraction and other options were available.\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\nNot selected, as the vulnerability is related to improper authorization, not making files or directories accessible to external parties.\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\nNot selected, as the vulnerability is primarily about access control, not exposure of sensitive information as the root cause.\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\nNot selected, as the vulnerability is related to improper authorization, not an observable discrepancy.\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 6759.49\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\nSelected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability involves an authorization check that is performed incorrectly.\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 6757.89\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead.
