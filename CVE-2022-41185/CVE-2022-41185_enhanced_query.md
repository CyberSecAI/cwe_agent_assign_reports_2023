# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-41185

# Vulnerability Description

    Due to **lack of proper memory management**, when a victim opens a manipulated Visual Design Stream (.vds, MataiPersistence.dll) file received from untrusted sources in SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Author - version 9, it is possible that a Remote Code Execution can be triggered when payload forces a stack-based overflow or a re-use of dangling pointer which refers to overwritten space in memory.

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...
