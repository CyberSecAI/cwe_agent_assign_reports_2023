CWE-113, a variant of CWE-93, focuses on HTTP headers. The vulnerability involves **CRLF injection** due to the **lack of validation on the redirect= parameter**, affecting HTTP headers, making CWE-93 the most appropriate primary classification. CWE-20, while relevant, is too general, and its mapping is discouraged by MITRE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\"]\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe93\n    cwe93 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe93\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe93 primary\n    class cwe113,cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of input validation** which leads to a **CRLF injection** vulnerability. This can then lead to XSS or information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **lack of validation** as the root cause, which aligns with CWE-93 and CWE-113. The key phrase \"**lack of validation on the redirect= parameter**\" and the description of the vulnerability as a \"**CRLF injection** vulnerability\" strongly support the selection of CWE-93 as the primary CWE. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause is a **lack of input validation** on the `redirect` parameter... This allows for CRLF injection.\"\n\nCWE-93 is the most specific and appropriate base-level CWE to describe the vulnerability. CWE-113 is a variant that is also relevant, as the CRLF injection specifically targets HTTP headers. CWE-20 is too general and is discouraged by MITRE when more specific CWEs are available. The final selection of CWE-93 as primary and CWE-113 as secondary is based on the evidence of **CRLF injection** in the context of HTTP headers due to **lack of input validation**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 7556.73\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n### CWEs Considered But Not Used:\n\n*   **CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'))**: This was considered but is not applicable because the vulnerability involves CRLF injection, not OS command injection.\n*   **CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)**: While the root cause is a **lack of input validation**, this CWE is too general. The vulnerability is more specifically a **CRLF injection**, making CWE-93 a better fit. MITRE also discourages using CWE-20 when more specific CWEs are available.\n*   **CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input)**: This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is not related to the validation of a specified quantity but rather the presence of CRLF sequences.\n*   **CWE-620 (Unverified Password Change)**: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability does not involve password changes.\n*   **CWE-117 (Improper Output Neutralization for Logs)**: While CRLF injection could potentially affect logs, the primary vulnerability is the injection itself, not the logging of the data.\n*   **CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF))**: This CWE is not directly related as the vulnerability is about injecting CRLF sequences, not forging requests.\n*   **CWE-641 (Improper Restriction of Names for Files and Other Resources)**: This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability doesn't involve file or resource naming.\n*   **CWE-138 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements)**: This CWE is too general and doesn't specifically address CRLF injection.",
