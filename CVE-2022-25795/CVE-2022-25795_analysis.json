CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-787 and CWE-788.\nThis means that CWE-122 is more specific than CWE-787.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe788[\"CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe788\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe122 secondary\n    class cwe788 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a maliciously crafted DWG file, which leads to **memory corruption**, specifically an **out-of-bounds write**, resulting in potential remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **memory corruption** vulnerability in Autodesk TrueView 2022 and 2021, triggered by maliciously crafted DWG files, potentially leading to remote code execution. The key phrase \"memory corruption\" suggested memory-related CWEs. The retriever results highlighted CWE-787 (**Out-of-bounds Write**) as the top candidate, which aligns with the description of writing data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary for CVE-2022-25795 reinforces this, describing a scenario where a crafted PDF file causes a dereference for a write beyond the allocated buffer in Autodesk AutoCAD.\n\nThe evidence supporting CWE-787 is strong, as the vulnerability description explicitly mentions **memory corruption**, and the CVE summary details an out-of-bounds write due to improper handling of crafted PDF files.\n\nCWE-122 (**Heap-based Buffer Overflow**) was considered since the **memory corruption** could result in a heap overflow. However, the provided information doesn't explicitly state that the buffer is allocated on the heap. Therefore, while possible, there isn't sufficient evidence to confirm a heap-based overflow.\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 as the primary CWE is based on the explicit mention of **memory corruption** and the detailed description of an out-of-bounds write in the CVE summary. This aligns with the CWE's description and mapping guidance.\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which highlights a clear case of **memory corruption** due to writing beyond buffer boundaries. The relationships between CWEs (CWE-787 and its children) were considered to ensure the most specific and accurate mapping.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
