While it is discouraged for direct mapping, in this case, it reflects the **improper authentication** process. CWE-757 (Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')) is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure). The vulnerability allows the disabling of network traffic encryption, suggesting a possible downgrade to a less secure or unencrypted communication, which is why it is a secondary CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe757[\"CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n\n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe757 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe757 secondary\n    class cwe284,cwe693 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper authentication** (CWE-287) in the Exynos baseband, leading to the ability to disable network traffic encryption between UE and gNodeB. This potentially allows a remote attacker to intercept or modify network traffic due to the absence of encryption. The disabling of network traffic encryption implies potentially downgrading to a less secure algorithm during negotiation (CWE-757).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which highlights **improper authentication** as the root cause.\n\nThe description states: \"**Improper authentication** in Exynos baseband prior to SMR DEC-2022 Release 1 allows remote attacker to disable the network traffic encryption between UE and gNodeB.\"\n\nThe primary CWE mapping is CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), as the vulnerability stems from insufficient validation or verification of the actor's identity. The retriever results also list CWE-287 as a potential candidate, though with a discouraged usage. However, given the explicit mention of \"**improper authentication**\" in the vulnerability description, it remains the most appropriate primary mapping.\n\nCWE-757 (Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')) is chosen as a secondary CWE because disabling encryption is essentially downgrading the security of the communication channel. This aligns with CWE-757's description: \"A protocol or its implementation supports interaction between multiple actors and allows those actors to negotiate which algorithm should be used as a protection mechanism... but it does not select the strongest algorithm that is available to both parties.\"\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-287 being a Class-level CWE directly related to the **root cause** and CWE-757 being a Base-level CWE detailing the consequence of disabling encryption.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
