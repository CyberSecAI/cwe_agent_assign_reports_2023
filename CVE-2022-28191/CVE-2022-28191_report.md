# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2022-28191

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-770 | Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-770, which is a child of CWE-400. While CWE-400 is a more general classification, the description clearly indicates that the vulnerability stems from the **allocation of resources without limits or throttling**, making CWE-770 a more specific and accurate representation of the weakness. CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE, and the guidance discourages its use when more specific Base-level children are available.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **uncontrolled resource consumption** issue in the Virtual GPU Manager, leading to a denial of service (DoS).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified **uncontrolled resource consumption** as the root cause, making CWE-400 a potential candidate. However, the description explicitly mentions "**uncontrolled resource consumption** can be triggered by an unprivileged regular user", and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms "**uncontrolled resource consumption** in the Virtual GPU Manager". Further analysis, especially considering the retriever results and the complete CWE specifications, pointed to CWE-770 as a more precise match.

The key evidence supporting CWE-770 is the "**uncontrolled resource consumption** can be triggered by an unprivileged regular user" statement, indicating that the resource allocation lacks proper limits or throttling.

CWE-770 is at the Base level of abstraction, which aligns with the recommendation to choose the lowest level that accurately represents the weakness.
