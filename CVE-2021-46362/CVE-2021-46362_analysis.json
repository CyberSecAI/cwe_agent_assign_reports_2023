CWE-78, a secondary CWE, is related to the impact, as successful template injection can lead to OS command execution. The relationships highlight the flow from the initial injection to potential system-level compromise. Abstraction levels were considered to ensure that the chosen CWEs were specific enough to represent the vulnerability while avoiding overly broad classifications.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code\"]\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command\"]\n    \n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe1336 -->|CANLEADTO| cwe78\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1336 primary\n    class cwe78,cwe94 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Server-Side Template Injection** (SSTI) due to **improper neutralization** of special elements. This leads to the ability to execute arbitrary code, potentially including OS commands, resulting in a compromised system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the report identified a **Server-Side Template Injection** vulnerability (SSTI) in Magnolia v6.2.3 and below. The core issue is the **improper neutralization** of special elements in the Registration and Forgotten Password forms, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted payload in the fullname parameter. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" clearly states the root cause as **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)** and notes the **insufficient input validation/filtering**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) as the primary CWE is strongly supported by the evidence. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **Server-Side Template Injection**, and the retriever results give CWE-1336 a score of 1.0. The CWE description aligns perfectly: \"The product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.\"\n\nCWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command) is included as a secondary CWE because the impact of successful template injection can include the ability to execute arbitrary OS commands. This CWE represents a potential consequence of the primary weakness.\n\nThe final selection of CWEs provides a specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability based on the provided evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an LDAP query using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended LDAP query when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
