# Analysis for CVE-2022-3807

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-770 | Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-789 | Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value | 0.8 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-476 | NULL Pointer Dereference | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling)** because the code allocates memory without proper checks on the size or number of resources. **CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value)** is a variant of **CWE-770**, representing the specific case where the size value is excessive, but the root cause is still the lack of limits or throttling. **CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference)** results from the unchecked memory allocation, where a null pointer is dereferenced if allocation fails.

## Vulnerability Chain
1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper Memory Allocation**: The code attempts to allocate a buffer without validating the size, leading to potential resource exhaustion (**CWE-770**).
2.  **Excessive Size Value:** The allocated memory might be excessively large (**CWE-789**).
3.  **Unchecked Allocation Result:** The code does not check if the memory allocation was successful.
4.  **Null Pointer Dereference:** If the allocation fails, a null pointer is dereferenced, leading to a crash (**CWE-476**).
5.  **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to the crash.

## Summary of Analysis
Initially, the analysis focused on the **resource consumption** impact and the reported **componentA vulnerability**. The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** provided crucial details about the **rootcause**: "unhandled memory allocation failure" and "**unchecked memory allocation**," as well as the resulting "Null Pointer Dereference."

The selection of **CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling)** as the primary CWE is based on the evidence that the code allocates memory without imposing restrictions on size, violating the intended security policy. The high retriever score for **CWE-770** also supports this choice.

**CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value)** is considered a secondary CWE as it specifies the variant where the allocated size is excessive, adding more detail to the allocation issue.

**CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference)** is a consequence of the unchecked memory allocation, and the code's attempt to dereference the null pointer if the allocation fails. This is why it is a secondary candidate.

The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they precisely represent the **rootcause** (CWE-770, CWE-789) and the direct consequence (CWE-476) of the vulnerability based on the **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**.

Other CWEs Considered and Rejected:

*   **CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'))** and **CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'))**: These are not relevant as the vulnerability is not related to input neutralization or web page generation.
*   **CWE-252 (Unchecked Return Value)**: While there's an unchecked return value aspect (allocation failure), the more direct issue is the resource allocation problem.
*   **CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type)**: Not related to file uploads.
*   **CWE-1325 (Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation)**: While related to memory allocation, the core issue isn't sequential allocation, but the lack of limits on the initial allocation.
*   **CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping)**: Not the primary issue, although the lack of a check on allocation could be considered a control flow problem.
*   **CWE-1241 (Use of Predictable Algorithm in Random Number Generator)** and **CWE-334 (Small Space of Random Values)**: Not relevant as the vulnerability does not involve random number generation.
*   **CWE-117 (Improper Output Neutralization for Logs)**: The vulnerability is not related to logging.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-3807 (Although the CVE description is a placeholder, the content refers to a related issue and previous CVE)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an unhandled memory allocation failure within the `AP4_RtpAtom::AP4_RtpAtom` constructor in `Ap4RtpAtom.cpp`. Specifically, the code attempts to allocate a buffer to parse an atom from a stream, and if this allocation fails, the program attempts to write the stream to null memory, causing a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unchecked Memory Allocation:** The code doesn't check if memory allocation via `new[]` is successful before proceeding to use the allocated memory.
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** In case of a memory allocation failure `new[]` returns null and the code attempts to dereference the null pointer, causing a crash.
- **Incomplete Fix:** The issue is described as an incomplete fix for a previous vulnerability (CVE-2019-13238) related to similar memory handling issues, highlighting the possibility of recurring flaws due to incomplete fixes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a crash due to the null pointer dereference, which would lead to a denial of service. The program terminates unexpectedly when it tries to process crafted input that triggers the memory allocation failure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input File:** The attack is triggered by providing a specially crafted input file (in this case, for the `mp42aac` tool) that is designed to cause a memory allocation failure during the parsing process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted input file to the `mp42aac` tool or any other process that uses vulnerable code.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided ASan trace clearly shows the out-of-memory error during the allocation, and the subsequent crash upon dereferencing the null pointer.
- A test case (`mp42aac_exhaustive_AP4_RtpAtom50.zip`) is provided, indicating the ease of reproducing this issue, and the possibility of a crafted input file leading to the crash.
- This vulnerability is not a new one and is described as a consequence of an incomplete fix of a previous issue.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.

### Extended Description
Two common programmer assumptions are "this function call can never fail" and "it doesn't matter if this function call fails". If an attacker can force the function to fail or otherwise return a value that is not expected, then the subsequent program logic could lead to a vulnerability, because the product is not in a state that the programmer assumes. For example, if the program calls a function to drop privileges but does not check the return code to ensure that privileges were successfully dropped, then the program will continue to operate with the higher privileges.

- **CVE-2020-6078:** Chain: The return value of a function returning a pointer is not checked for success (CWE-252) resulting in the later use of an uninitialized variable (CWE-456) and a null pointer dereference (CWE-476)
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).




## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

### Extended Description


Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:


  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.

  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.

  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.

  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.

  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.

  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.

There are three main kinds of XSS:

  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.

  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. 

  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. 

Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as "drive-by hacking."

In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.


### Alternative Terms
XSS: A common abbreviation for Cross-Site Scripting.
HTML Injection: Used as a synonym of stored (Type 2) XSS.
CSS: In the early years after initial discovery of XSS, "CSS" was a commonly-used acronym. However, this would cause confusion with "Cascading Style Sheets," so usage of this acronym has declined significantly.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

There can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.


**[Applicable Platform]** 

XSS flaws are very common in web applications, since they require a great deal of developer discipline to avoid them.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-25926:** Python Library Manager did not sufficiently neutralize a user-supplied search term, allowing reflected XSS.
- **CVE-2021-25963:** Python-based e-commerce platform did not escape returned content on error pages, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.
- **CVE-2021-1879:** Universal XSS in mobile operating system, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.

CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).




## CWE-1241: Use of Predictable Algorithm in Random Number Generator
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The device uses an algorithm that is predictable and generates a pseudo-random number.

### Extended Description


Pseudo-random number generator algorithms are predictable because their registers have a finite number of possible states, which eventually lead to repeating patterns. As a result, pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) can compromise their randomness or expose their internal state to various attacks, such as reverse engineering or tampering. It is highly recommended to use hardware-based true random number generators (TRNGs) to ensure the security of encryption schemes. TRNGs generate unpredictable, unbiased, and independent random numbers because they employ physical phenomena, e.g., electrical noise, as sources to generate random numbers.


### Alternative Terms

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, "randomness" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-3692:** PHP framework uses mt_rand() function (Marsenne Twister) when generating tokens




## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.

### Extended Description


Code frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-400
ChildOf -> CWE-665
ChildOf -> CWE-400

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).

**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. "Resource exhaustion" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..
- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.




## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.

### Extended Description


While the product might limit the amount of memory that is allocated in a single operation for a single object (such as a malloc of an array), if an attacker can cause multiple objects to be allocated in separate operations, then this might cause higher total memory consumption than the developer intended, leading to a denial of service.


### Alternative Terms
Stack Exhaustion: When a weakness allocates excessive memory on the stack, it is often described as "stack exhaustion," which is a technical impact of the weakness. This technical impact is often encountered as a consequence of CWE-789 and/or CWE-1325.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-36049:** JavaScript-based packet decoder uses concatenation of many small strings, causing out-of-memory (OOM) condition
- **CVE-2019-20176:** Product allocates a new buffer on the stack for each file in a directory, allowing stack exhaustion
- **CVE-2013-1591:** Chain: an integer overflow (CWE-190) in the image size calculation causes an infinite loop (CWE-835) which sequentially allocates buffers without limits (CWE-1325) until the stack is full.




## CWE-334: Small Space of Random Values
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

- **CVE-2002-0903:** Product uses small number of random numbers for a code to approve an action, and also uses predictable new user IDs, allowing attackers to hijack new accounts.
- **CVE-2003-1230:** SYN cookies implementation only uses 32-bit keys, making it easier to brute force ISN.




## CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes output that is written to logs.

### Extended Description


This can allow an attacker to forge log entries or inject malicious content into logs.


Log forging vulnerabilities occur when:


  1. Data enters an application from an untrusted source.

  1. The data is written to an application or system log file.

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Unrestricted File Upload: Used in vulnerability databases and elsewhere, but it is insufficiently precise. The phrase could be interpreted as the lack of restrictions on the size or number of uploaded files, which is a resource consumption issue.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

This can have a chaining relationship with incomplete denylist / permissive allowlist errors when the product tries, but fails, to properly limit which types of files are allowed (CWE-183, CWE-184).


This can also overlap multiple interpretation errors for intermediaries, e.g. anti-virus products that do not remove or quarantine attachments with certain file extensions that can be processed by client systems.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-5227:** PHP-based FAQ management app does not check the MIME type for uploaded images
- **CVE-2001-0901:** Web-based mail product stores ".shtml" attachments that could contain SSI
- **CVE-2002-1841:** PHP upload does not restrict file types
