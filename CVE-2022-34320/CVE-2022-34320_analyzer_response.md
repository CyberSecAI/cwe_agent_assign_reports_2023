# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-327 | Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm | 1.0 | Class | Primary CWE | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-1240 | Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation | 0.75 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the selection was the ChildOf relationship between CWE-1240 and CWE-327. CWE-1240 is a more specific case of CWE-327, dealing with risky implementations of cryptographic primitives. However, the vulnerability description does not provide sufficient detail to confirm the risky implementation, so the higher-level CWE-327 is chosen.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events is:
1.  **ROOT CAUSE**: Use of **weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms** (CWE-327)
2.  IMPACT: An attacker could decrypt highly sensitive information.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment, supported by the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" and "CVE Reference Links Content Summary," points to the use of **weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms** as the root cause.

The description explicitly mentions "weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms." This directly corresponds to CWE-327, "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm." The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" also indicates "Use of weak cryptographic algorithms" as the root cause.

CWE-327 is a Class-level CWE. The mapping guidance suggests examining child entries for a better fit. CWE-1240, "Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation," is a child of CWE-327 and could be a more specific match if the vulnerability description clearly indicated a risky implementation. However, as the description does not provide details on the specific implementation, choosing CWE-1240 would not be the best mapping.

The "Retriever Results" also lists CWE-327 as the top combined result, which further supports this choice.

Therefore, based on the evidence and the relationship analysis, CWE-327 is the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability. It is at an adequate level of specificity, given the available information. CWE-1240 is also considered as a secondary candidate.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions is not set, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
To fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
