CWE-1240 is a more specific case of CWE-327, dealing with risky implementations of cryptographic primitives. However, the vulnerability description does not provide sufficient detail to confirm the risky implementation, so the higher-level CWE-327 is chosen.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe1240[\"CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\"]\n    \n    cwe1240 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe327 primary\n    class cwe1240 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is:\n1.  **ROOT CAUSE**: Use of **weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms** (CWE-327)\n2.  IMPACT: An attacker could decrypt highly sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, supported by the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" points to the use of **weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms** as the root cause.\n\nThe description explicitly mentions \"weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms.\" This directly corresponds to CWE-327, \"Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also indicates \"Use of weak cryptographic algorithms\" as the root cause.\n\nCWE-327 is a Class-level CWE. The mapping guidance suggests examining child entries for a better fit. CWE-1240, \"Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation,\" is a child of CWE-327 and could be a more specific match if the vulnerability description clearly indicated a risky implementation. However, as the description does not provide details on the specific implementation, choosing CWE-1240 would not be the best mapping.\n\nThe \"Retriever Results\" also lists CWE-327 as the top combined result, which further supports this choice.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence and the relationship analysis, CWE-327 is the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability. It is at an adequate level of specificity, given the available information. CWE-1240 is also considered as a secondary candidate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions is not set, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
