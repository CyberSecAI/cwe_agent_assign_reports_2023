It is a child of CWE-1390, Weak Authentication, indicating that it is a specific type of authentication issue. CWE-306, Missing Authentication for Critical Function, is also considered as it highlights the lack of proper authentication mechanisms. CWE-732, Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, is a higher-level class that could be applicable, but CWE-620 provides a more precise description of the flaw.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe620[\"CWE-620: Unverified Password Change\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe620 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe620 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe732 secondary\n    class cwe1390, cwe287 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insecure permissions** (as noted in the description) leading to a missing validation of the user's identity during the password reset process. This allows an attacker to change the password of any user if they know the user ID, resulting in potential account takeover.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Insecure Permissions**, Missing session validation, **Lack of mb_dupinfo check**\n  - **Weakness:** Unverified Password Change (CWE-620), Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306)\n  - **Impact:** Unauthorized Password Change, Account Takeover\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the vulnerability as being caused by **insecure permissions**. The retriever results pointed to several potential CWEs, including CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource), CWE-1188 (Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default), and CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key). However, after a deeper analysis of the vulnerability description and the provided CVE Reference Links Content Summary, it became clear that the core issue was the **lack of proper validation** when updating the password after a user initiates a password reset. The system did not sufficiently verify the user's identity, allowing an attacker to change another user's password if they knew their ID.\n\nThe key evidence supporting this is: \"The password update query was missing the `mb_dupinfo` check, allowing a user to potentially change the password of another user if they knew their user ID\" and \"The `password_reset_update.php` file was missing the session check before updating the password.\"\n\nTherefore, CWE-620 (Unverified Password Change) is the most accurate and specific CWE to describe this vulnerability because it directly addresses the scenario where a product allows a password change without verifying the original password or using another form of authentication. While CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) could also be considered, CWE-620 more precisely captures the specific flaw in the password reset process. The evidence points to a **missing check**, rather than an incorrect assignment of permissions which makes CWE-732 less accurate. CWE-1188 is less relevant because the issue isn't with an insecure default setting that an admin should change but with a flaw in the password reset logic.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nDuring installation, installed file permissions are set to allow anyone to modify those files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
