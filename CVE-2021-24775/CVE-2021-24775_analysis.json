CWE-862 is a child of CWE-285 [Improper Authorization] and CWE-284 [Improper Access Control]. The secondary CWE is CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor], which is a class-level CWE and a child of CWE-668 [Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere]. The vulnerability involves an unauthenticated user being able to access a REST endpoint and retrieve the title of private or draft posts. This indicates a failure to perform an authorization check, aligning with CWE-862. The result of this **missing authorization** is the **exposure of sensitive information**, namely the titles of private/draft posts. The relationship shows a clear progression from a missing authorization check to the exposure of sensitive information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events in this vulnerability is:\n1.  **Missing Authorization (CWE-862):** The REST endpoint lacks proper authorization checks.\n2.  **Exposure of Sensitive Information (CWE-200):** As a result, unauthenticated users can access private/draft post titles.\n\nThe root cause is the **missing authorization** check, which directly leads to the impact of **exposure of sensitive information**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, CWE-862 [Missing Authorization] was identified as the primary weakness because the vulnerability description and CVE summary content clearly stated that the REST endpoint did not properly restrict access, which allowed unauthenticated users to retrieve the titles of private and draft posts. This aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-862, where a product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] was considered as a secondary weakness, because the result of **missing authorization** allowed the titles of private and draft posts to be accessed by unauthorized users.\n\nThe retriever results also supported the selection of CWE-862, with a high ranking. The relationship analysis showed how **missing authorization** directly leads to **exposure of sensitive information**.\n\nThe final decision was to map CWE-862 as the primary weakness, accurately capturing the root cause of the vulnerability. CWE-200 was added as a secondary weakness to show that information was exposed because of the **missing authorization**. This approach ensured the selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, focusing on the cause and consequence of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
