The resulting impact, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), is represented by CWE-918. CWE-330 is a class-level CWE, and its child CWE-340 (Generation of Predictable Numbers or Identifiers) could be a more specific mapping but the description of CWE-330 is more generally applicable to the **predictable** values. CWE-918 is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-441 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements) and CWE-610 (Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe330[\"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\"]\n    cwe340[\"CWE-340: Generation of Predictable Numbers or Identifiers\"]\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe441[\"CWE-441: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\"]\n    cwe610[\"CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe340 -->|CHILDOF| cwe330\n    cwe918 -->|CHILDOF| cwe441\n    cwe918 -->|CHILDOF| cwe610\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe330 primary\n    class cwe918 secondary\n    class cwe340,cwe441,cwe610 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **predictable** multipart boundaries (CWE-330), which allows an attacker to inject parameters into internal API calls, ultimately leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (CWE-918).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the root cause as the **predictable** multipart boundaries, which enables the SSRF. The evidence provided in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section confirms that the multipart boundaries are predictable because they are based on a timestamp with millisecond resolution. This allows attackers to predict future boundaries and overwrite their content. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" also highlights the **predictable multipart/form-data boundaries** as the root cause and SSRF as the impact.\n\nThe selection of CWE-330 is based on the fact that the boundaries are generated with insufficiently random values, which allows attackers to predict them. The retriever results listed CWE-330 as the top combined result. While CWE-340 (Generation of Predictable Numbers or Identifiers) is a child of CWE-330 and could be considered, the description of CWE-330 more accurately captures the general issue of using insufficiently random values, as the problem isn't strictly about generating *numbers* or *identifiers*. CWE-330 is a class level, which the mapping guidance discourages but since it is the best fit is allowed with review.\n\nThe selection of CWE-918 is based on the fact that the **predictable** boundaries enable an attacker to inject parameters into internal API calls, leading to the web server retrieving content from an unexpected destination.\n\nBoth CWEs are at appropriate levels of specificity, with CWE-330 representing the root cause and CWE-918 representing the direct impact of the vulnerability. The relationships between these CWEs, as shown in the graph, highlight the chain of events that leads to the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
