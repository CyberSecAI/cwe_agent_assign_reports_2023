It has a parent-child relationship with CWE-119 (**Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**). CWE-131 (**Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size**) can precede CWE-119, and thus can also precede CWE-787 in a vulnerability chain. This relationship influenced the inclusion of CWE-131 as a secondary weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe131[\"CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe131 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe131 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **incorrect calculation of buffer size (CWE-131)**, which leads to an undersized buffer. Subsequently, when data is written to this buffer, it results in an **out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)**, ultimately causing memory corruption.\n  - Root Cause: CWE-131\n  - Weakness: CWE-787\n  - Impact: Memory Corruption\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points to CWE-787 (**Out-of-bounds Write**) as the primary weakness, based on the vulnerability description explicitly stating an **out-of-bounds write** vulnerability. The CVE reference links content summary further supports this by detailing how the `allocation_function_mem` function **lacks sufficient memory allocation checks, resulting in a smaller buffer and subsequent out-of-bounds write**.\n```\nRoot cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability lies in the allocation_function_mem function of Accusoft ImageGear library, where a missing check for memory bounds within a heap buffer leads to a buffer overflow. Specifically, the size of the allocated buffer (psd_buffer_oobw) is calculated based on the width and bits per channel from the PSD file, but this calculation doesn't account for a minimum buffer size when bits_per_channel is 1. This allows for a smaller buffer than required, resulting in an out-of-bounds write during subsequent operations.\n```\n\nThe retriever results also identify CWE-787 as a relevant candidate. The relationship analysis reveals that CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (**Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**).\n\nConsidering the root cause analysis and the description of the vulnerability, it is clear that the buffer size calculation is flawed. The `allocation_function_mem` function calculates the buffer size based on the width and bits per channel of the PSD file, but fails to account for minimum buffer sizes when `bits_per_channel` is 1. This leads to allocating a smaller buffer than required, and subsequently, a write operation goes beyond the intended boundary. This indicates an incorrect calculation of the buffer size, making CWE-131 (**Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size**) a relevant secondary CWE.\n\nTherefore, the selected CWEs (CWE-787 and CWE-131) are at the optimal level of specificity, accurately representing both the direct cause and the contributing factor of the vulnerability.\n\n**CWE Considerations:**\n\n*   CWE-190 (**Integer Overflow or Wraparound**) and CWE-197 (**Numeric Truncation Error**) were considered because the root cause involves an integer calculation related to memory allocation. However, the evidence indicates that the primary issue is not an overflow or truncation, but rather a flawed calculation logic.\n*   CWE-125 (**Out-of-bounds Read**) was considered, but the vulnerability description and CVE summary clearly state that the issue is an **out-of-bounds write**, not a read.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
