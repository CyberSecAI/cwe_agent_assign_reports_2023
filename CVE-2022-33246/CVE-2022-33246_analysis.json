It is related to CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) via a CANPRECEDE relationship, where an out-of-range pointer offset can lead to an out-of-bounds write. Both are children of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). The abstraction levels influenced the selection by favoring the more specific CWE-823.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe823[\"CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe823 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe823 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe823 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of an out-of-range pointer offset** (CWE-823), which leads to **memory corruption**. The **memory corruption** could manifest as an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-823 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of \"**use of out-of-range pointer offset**\" in the vulnerability description. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" also directly mentions \"**use of out-of-range pointer offset**\" as the root cause.\nThe retriever results also lists CWE-823 as a very high contender, albeit after CWE-787.\n\nCWE-787 was considered a secondary candidate because **memory corruption** is a consequence of using an out-of-range pointer offset.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-823 can precede CWE-787, reinforcing the chain of events.\n\nThe final selection prioritizes the root cause (CWE-823) while acknowledging the potential impact (CWE-787). Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, providing an optimal level of specificity. The assessment is primarily based on the explicit mention of the **out-of-range pointer offset** as the **rootcause** in the provided evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25
