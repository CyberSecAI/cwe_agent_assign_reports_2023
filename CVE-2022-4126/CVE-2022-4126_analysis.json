CWE-1393 is a more specific case of CWE-1392, focusing specifically on default passwords. Given the explicit mention of a default password in the vulnerability description, CWE-1393 was deemed the more appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1393[\"CWE-1393: Use of Default Password\"]\n    cwe1392[\"CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe1393 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1392\n    cwe1392 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1391\n    cwe1391 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1393 primary\n    class cwe1392,cwe1391,cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a default password** (CWE-1393). An attacker exploits this by using the default password to gain unauthorized access. The impact is unauthorized access to the ABB RCCMD product.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states \"Use of Default Password vulnerability in ABB RCCMD\". The phrase \"**use of default password**\" directly corresponds to CWE-1393.\n\nThe retriever results also ranked CWE-1393 as the top candidate with a high score. The CWE specifications for CWE-1393 describe the weakness precisely: \"The product uses default passwords for potentially critical functionality.\"\n\nThe evidence is strong and directly supports the selection of CWE-1393 as the primary CWE. The abstraction level is Base, which is a preferred level. The relationship analysis confirmed that choosing the most specific CWE, CWE-1393, is appropriate in this context.\n\nCWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information), CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials), CWE-1391 (Use of Weak Credentials), CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password), CWE-1392 (Use of Default Credentials), CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key), CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions), CWE-204 (Observable Response Discrepancy), and CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) were considered but not selected. While some of these CWEs have related aspects, such as the credentials being weak (CWE-1391) or the credentials potentially being stored insecurely (CWE-312, CWE-522), the root cause is the **use of a default password**. Therefore, CWE-1393 is the most accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability.",
