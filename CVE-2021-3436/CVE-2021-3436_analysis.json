It has parent child relationships to CWE-99 and CWE-573. There are no chain relationships. The abstraction level of Base is appropriate because it is the most specific level that matches the provided information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe694[\"CWE-694: Use of Multiple Resources with Duplicate Identifier\"]\n    cwe99[\"CWE-99: Improper Control of Resource Identifiers\"]\n    cwe573[\"CWE-573: Improper Handling of Multiple Encoded Data Streams in Single Resource\"]\n    \n    cwe694 -->|CHILDOF| cwe99\n    cwe694 -->|CHILDOF| cwe573\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe694 primary\n    class cwe99,cwe573 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Use of Multiple Resources with Duplicate Identifier (CWE-694)**, leading to overwriting existing bond information in persistent storage, incorrect key entry selection, MIC failure, pairing failure, and disconnection.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the provided **rootcause**, **Use of Multiple Resources with Duplicate Identifier (CWE-694)**, which is a direct match for the vulnerability description. The vulnerability description explicitly states: \"Zephyr versions >= 1.14.2, >= 2.4.0, >= 2.5.0 contain **Use of Multiple Resources with Duplicate Identifier (CWE-694)**.\" The evidence strength is high because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the CWE.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-694 is a child of CWE-99 and CWE-573, but these are higher level and less specific than CWE-694.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the **rootcause** identified in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-694: Use of Multiple Resources with Duplicate Identifier\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses multiple resources that can have the same identifier, in a context in which unique identifiers are required.\n\n### Extended Description\nIf the product assumes that each resource has a unique identifier, the product could operate on the wrong resource if attackers can cause multiple resources to be associated with the same identifier.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-99\nChildOf -> CWE-573\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness is probably closely associated with other issues related to doubling, such as CWE-675 (Duplicate Operations on Resource). It's often a case of an API contract violation (CWE-227).\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2013-4787:** chain: mobile OS verifies cryptographic signature of file in an archive, but then installs a different file with the same name that is also listed in the archive.",
