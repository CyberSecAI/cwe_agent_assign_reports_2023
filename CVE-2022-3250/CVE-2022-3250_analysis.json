CWE-319 describes the general case of transmitting sensitive information in cleartext, while CWE-614 focuses specifically on the missing \"Secure\" attribute for cookies in HTTPS sessions. The vulnerability clearly states the cookie does not have a secure attribute which fits CWE-614 very well and is more specific.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe614[\"CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe1275[\"CWE-1275: Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute\"]\n\n    cwe614 -->|ChildOf| cwe319\n    cwe1275 -->|PeerOf| cwe614\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe614 primary\n    class cwe319,cwe1275 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing secure attribute** on a sensitive cookie. This leads to the possibility of the cookie being transmitted in cleartext over HTTP, which in turn allows an attacker to intercept the cookie and hijack the user's session.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-614 as the primary weakness because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **\"Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without Secure Attribute\"**. This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-614.\n\nThe **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** section provides strong evidence, stating that the vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the \"Secure\" attribute for session cookies in the rdiffweb application. The **missing \"Secure\" attribute on Session Cookie in HTTPS** is the primary weakness.\n\nCWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) was considered because the impact of the vulnerability is that the cookie could be transmitted in cleartext. However, CWE-614 is more specific, focusing on the root cause (the missing \"Secure\" attribute), making it a better fit.\n\nCWE-1275 (Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute) was also considered. While both CWE-614 and CWE-1275 deal with cookie attributes, the vulnerability description focuses on the \"Secure\" attribute, not the \"SameSite\" attribute.\n\nThe selection of CWE-614 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability (the missing \"Secure\" attribute) and is a Variant level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
