This parent-child relationship suggests that the vulnerability involves the transmission of sensitive information in cleartext, but specifically focuses on the case where this happens via a cookie that lacks the secure attribute within an HTTPS session.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe614[\"CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe614 -->|CHILDOF| cwe319\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe614 primary\n    class cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause**, a **sensitive cookie in HTTPS session without secure attribute**, leading to the potential for the cookie to be transmitted in cleartext.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-614 (Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute) as the primary CWE due to the **rootcause** clearly stating \"sensitive cookie in HTTPS session without secure attribute\" which is a direct match. The retriever results also list CWE-614 as the top combined result and the description matches perfectly.\n\nCWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) was considered, as it is a parent of CWE-614 and thus a more general description of the vulnerability. The cookie without the secure flag is being transmitted over HTTPS without the 'Secure' attribute, meaning that the cookie could potentially be transmitted over HTTP, thus sending the data in cleartext.\n\nThe evidence for CWE-614 is strong, as it is a direct match to the vulnerability description key phrase.\n\nCWE-614 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the vulnerability's **rootcause**. While CWE-319 is more general, CWE-614 provides a more accurate and detailed classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
