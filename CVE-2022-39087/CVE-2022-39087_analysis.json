It has child relationships to CWE-285 **Improper Authorization** and CWE-284 **Improper Access Control**. CWE-280 **Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges** is a base-level CWE and a potential secondary CWE because the **missing permission check** implies that the software may not be handling the case where it lacks sufficient permissions, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe280[\"CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|ChildOf| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe280 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **missing permission check** (CWE-862). The impact of this **missing check** is a local escalation of privilege.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **missing permission check** which directly corresponds to CWE-862 **Missing Authorization**. The vulnerability description explicitly states a **missing permission check**, aligning perfectly with the definition of CWE-862. The retriever results also list CWE-862 as the top candidate. The analysis is strongly based on the vulnerability description key phrases. The selection of CWE-862 is at the class level, which is the most appropriate given the available information. While more specific Base-level CWEs might exist, there isn't sufficient information to determine which one is most appropriate. CWE-280 is considered as a secondary candidate because the missing permission check may lead to the software not handling situations where it lacks sufficient privileges.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
