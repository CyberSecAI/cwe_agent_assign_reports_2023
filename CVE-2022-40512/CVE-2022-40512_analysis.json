The mapping guidance for CWE-119 also discourages its use when lower-level CWEs are available. CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) was also considered, but CWE-126 is more specific.\n\nCWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) could be a contributing factor if the over-read is due to an incorrectly specified length.
