It is related to CWE-285, Improper Authorization, as CWE-863 is a child of CWE-285. The abstraction level influenced the selection by favoring a more specific Class level CWE over a broader Pillar level CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves an initial **incorrect authorization** leading to unauthorized access to AWS resources.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Incorrect Authorization** (CWE-863)\n  - **Impact:** Access to AWS resources normally limited to TeamCity system administrators.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is that TeamCity project administrators were able to access AWS resources they should not have been able to. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions that project administrators could access AWS resources normally limited to system administrators, indicating a flaw in the authorization mechanism.\n\nThe retriever results suggested several CWEs, including CWE-453, CWE-863, CWE-532, CWE-923, CWE-285, CWE-1392, CWE-322 and CWE-259. Given the description, CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) seemed most relevant, as the vulnerability directly involves **incorrectly** permitting access to resources.\n\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization) was also considered, but it's a broader category and the description specifically indicates an *incorrect* authorization, not necessarily a missing one (which would align more with CWE-862). The MITRE mapping guidance discourages using CWE-285 directly when more specific options exist.\n\nThe final conclusion is that CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is the most appropriate primary CWE because it accurately reflects the **incorrect** authorization that led to the unauthorized access. The evidence directly supports this, as the vulnerability description states that project administrators could access resources they normally should not have been able to access.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**:

guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies

dense\n\n**Description**:\nA client/server product performs authentication within client code but not in server code, allowing server-side authentication to be bypassed via a modified client that omits the authentication check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 4257.34\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product
