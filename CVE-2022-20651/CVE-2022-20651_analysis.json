This is a **Base** level CWE.\n\nCWE-532 has a ChildOf relationship to CWE-538 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory) and CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor).\n\nCWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) is a related weakness, and has a ChildOf relationship to CWE-922 (Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe538[\"CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe922[\"CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe538\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe922\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe312 secondary\n    class cwe538,cwe200,cwe922 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **storage of unencrypted credentials** (**ROOTCAUSE**). This leads to sensitive information being present in the logs. The vulnerability allows an attacker to access the logs and view the credentials of other users (**IMPACT**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary strongly points towards **storage of unencrypted credentials in logs**, which aligns directly with CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description key phrases support this. The evidence from the CVE reference links content summary confirms the **storage of unencrypted credentials in logs** as the root cause.\n\nThe graph relationships show that the selected CWE is at the appropriate level of specificity. CWE-532 is more specific than its parents, CWE-538 and CWE-200, and accurately describes the vulnerability.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description, the CVE reference summary, and the relationships between the CWEs. CWE-532 is the most appropriate CWE because it directly addresses the **insertion of sensitive information into log files**, which is the core issue. CWE-312 is also included as a secondary issue due to the fact the information is stored in cleartext.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\nThis CWE was not selected as it doesn't fit the vulnerability description, which focuses on storing unencrypted credentials rather than making security decisions based on untrusted inputs.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\nThis CWE was not selected because the vulnerability is not about improper validation of input equivalence. It is about storing sensitive information in cleartext in logs.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\nCWE-538 is a parent of CWE-532 (the selected CWE).

The vulnerability involves storing unencrypted credentials in logs, which means the information is stored in cleartext. The fact that the credentials are unencrypted is a contributing factor to the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\nThis CWE was not selected because the vulnerability is not about using weak credentials, but about storing credentials in cleartext.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\nThis CWE was not selected because the vulnerability is not about failing to remove sensitive information before reuse.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\nThis CWE was not selected because the vulnerability is not about transmitting sensitive information in cleartext.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\nThis CWE was not selected because the vulnerability is not about improper removal of sensitive information.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\nThis CWE was not selected because the vulnerability is not about a permissive list of allowed inputs.\n\n## CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\nCWE-922 is a class-level CWE.
