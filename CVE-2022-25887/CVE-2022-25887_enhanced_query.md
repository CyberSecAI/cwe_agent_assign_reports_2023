## Vulnerability Description
The package sanitize-html before 2.7.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to insecure global regular expression replacement logic of HTML comment removal.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **regular expression denial of service**
- **product:** sanitize-html
- **version:** before 2.7.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-25887:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure global regular expression replacement logic used for removing HTML comments within the `sanitize-html` library. The regular expression used was susceptible to catastrophic backtracking, a condition that can lead to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **ReDoS vulnerability:** The core weakness is the use of a vulnerable regular expression pattern for removing HTML comments. This pattern could cause the regex engine to perform an excessive amount of backtracking when processing specific malicious inputs.
- **Insecure global regex replacement:** The use of global regular expression replacement logic, specifically when handling HTML comment removal was the source of the issue, which was corrected by replacing it with a more efficient implementation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing crafted HTML inputs with a large number of nested or repeating comment-like structures, an attacker can cause the `sanitize-html` library to consume excessive CPU resources. This leads to a denial-of-service condition, making the application unresponsive or slow for legitimate users. The vulnerability is termed a "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)".
- **Reduced Availability:** The service's performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability, potentially impacting the entire application using the vulnerable library.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning an attacker can send malicious inputs over the network, without prior authentication or user interaction.
- **Input manipulation:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by providing malicious HTML content to be processed by `sanitize-html`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No special privileges required:** The attacker does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system, only the ability to send crafted input.
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely through the network.
- **Ability to provide user input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide an HTML input that will be processed by the vulnerable function.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves replacing the global regular expression replacement logic for comment removal with a new implementation, which avoids catastrophic backtracking, as shown in the github commit diff.
- The vulnerability is present in versions of `sanitize-html` prior to 2.7.1.
- The Snyk vulnerability information indicates a medium severity rating (5.3), while NVD rates it as high severity (7.5), which could indicate differing interpretations of the vulnerability's impact.

This information provides a comprehensive understanding of the CVE-2022-25887 vulnerability and how it can be exploited.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.

### Extended Description
Some regular expression engines have a feature called "backtracking". If the token cannot match, the engine "backtracks" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.
 Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:


  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.

  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.

  - The input can be long enough.

 Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. 

### Alternative Terms
ReDoS: ReDoS is an abbreviation of "Regular expression Denial of Service".
Regular Expression Denial of Service: While this term is attack-focused, this is commonly used to describe the weakness.
Catastrophic backtracking: This term is used to describe the behavior of the regular expression as a negative technical impact.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-5243:** server allows ReDOS with crafted User-Agent strings, due to overlapping capture groups that cause excessive backtracking.
- **CVE-2021-21317:** npm package for user-agent parser prone to ReDoS due to overlapping capture groups
- **CVE-2019-16215:** Markdown parser uses inefficient regex when processing a message, allowing users to cause CPU consumption and delay preventing processing of other messages.




## CWE-777: Regular Expression without Anchors
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a regular expression to perform neutralization, but the regular expression is not anchored and may allow malicious or malformed data to slip through.

### Extended Description
When performing tasks such as validating against a set of allowed inputs (allowlist), data is examined and possibly modified to ensure that it is well-formed and adheres to a list of safe values. If the regular expression is not anchored, malicious or malformed data may be included before or after any string matching the regular expression. The type of malicious data that is allowed will depend on the context of the application and which anchors are omitted from the regular expression.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).




## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.

### Extended Description


While assertion is good for catching logic errors and reducing the chances of reaching more serious vulnerability conditions, it can still lead to a denial of service.


For example, if a server handles multiple simultaneous connections, and an assert() occurs in one single connection that causes all other connections to be dropped, this is a reachable assertion that leads to a denial of service.


### Alternative Terms
assertion failure

- **CVE-2006-6811:** Chat client allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a long message string when connecting to a server, which causes an assertion failure.




## CWE-185: Incorrect Regular Expression
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product specifies a regular expression in a way that causes data to be improperly matched or compared.

### Extended Description
When the regular expression is used in protection mechanisms such as filtering or validation, this may allow an attacker to bypass the intended restrictions on the incoming data.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-697
CanPrecede -> CWE-187
CanPrecede -> CWE-182

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** While there is some overlap with allowlist/denylist problems, this entry is intended to deal with incorrectly written regular expressions, regardless of their intended use. Not every regular expression is intended for use as an allowlist or denylist. In addition, allowlists and denylists can be implemented using other mechanisms besides regular expressions.

**[Research Gap]** Regexp errors are likely a primary factor in many MFVs, especially those that require multiple manipulations to exploit. However, they are rarely diagnosed at this level of detail.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-2109:** Regexp isn't "anchored" to the beginning or end, which allows spoofed values that have trusted values as substrings.
- **CVE-2005-1949:** Regexp for IP address isn't anchored at the end, allowing appending of shell metacharacters.
- **CVE-2001-1072:** Bypass access restrictions via multiple leading slash, which causes a regular expression to fail.




## CWE-186: Overly Restrictive Regular Expression
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A regular expression is overly restrictive, which prevents dangerous values from being detected.

### Extended Description
This weakness is not about regular expression complexity. Rather, it is about a regular expression that does not match all values that are intended. Consider the use of a regexp to identify acceptable values or to spot unwanted terms. An overly restrictive regexp misses some potentially security-relevant values leading to either false positives *or* false negatives, depending on how the regexp is being used within the code. Consider the expression /[0-8]/ where the intention was /[0-9]/. This expression is not "complex" but the value "9" is not matched when maybe the programmer planned to check for it.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships

**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Can overlap allowlist/denylist errors (CWE-183/CWE-184)



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-1604:** MIE. ".php.ns" bypasses ".php$" regexp but is still parsed as PHP by Apache. (manipulates an equivalence property under Apache)




## CWE-151: Improper Neutralization of Comment Delimiters
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as comment delimiters when they are sent to a downstream component.

### Extended Description

**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-0001:** Mail client command execution due to improperly terminated comment in address list.
- **CVE-2004-0162:** MIE. RFC822 comment fields may be processed as other fields by clients.
- **CVE-2004-1686:** Well-placed comment bypasses security warning.




## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
off-by-five: An "off-by-five" error was reported for sudo in 2002 (CVE-2002-0184), but that is more like a "length calculation" error.

### Relationships

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is not always a buffer overflow. For example, an off-by-one error could be a factor in a partial comparison, a read from the wrong memory location, an incorrect conditional, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2003-0252:** Off-by-one error allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via requests that do not contain newlines.
- **CVE-2001-1391:** Off-by-one vulnerability in driver allows users to modify kernel memory.
- **CVE-2002-0083:** Off-by-one error allows local users or remote malicious servers to gain privileges.




## CWE-625: Permissive Regular Expression
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a regular expression that does not sufficiently restrict the set of allowed values.

### Extended Description


This effectively causes the regexp to accept substrings that match the pattern, which produces a partial comparison to the target. In some cases, this can lead to other weaknesses. Common errors include:


  - not identifying the beginning and end of the target string

  - using wildcards instead of acceptable character ranges

  - others



### Alternative Terms

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22204:** Chain: regex in EXIF processor code does not correctly determine where a string ends (CWE-625), enabling eval injection (CWE-95), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2006-1895:** ".*" regexp leads to static code injection
- **CVE-2002-2175:** insertion of username into regexp results in partial comparison, causing wrong database entry to be updated when one username is a substring of another.




## CWE-158: Improper Neutralization of Null Byte or NUL Character
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes NUL characters or null bytes when they are sent to a downstream component.

### Extended Description
As data is parsed, an injected NUL character or null byte may cause the product to believe the input is terminated earlier than it actually is, or otherwise cause the input to be misinterpreted. This could then be used to inject potentially dangerous input that occurs after the null byte or otherwise bypass validation routines and other protection mechanisms.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-138

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be a factor in multiple interpretation errors, other interaction errors, filename equivalence, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2008-1284:** NUL byte in theme name causes directory traversal impact to be worse
- **CVE-2005-2008:** Source code disclosure using trailing null.
- **CVE-2005-3293:** Source code disclosure using trailing null.




## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion
