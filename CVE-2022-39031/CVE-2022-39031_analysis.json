CWE-862 and CWE-863 are both children of CWE-285, which is a child of CWE-284. Given the vulnerability description's emphasis on the lack of authorization, CWE-862 is the most specific and appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe284,cwe285,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves a **missing authorization** check, which leads to the ability to acquire session IDs of other general users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the most accurate CWE to represent the **insufficient authorization** vulnerability. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section clearly indicates \"**insufficient authorization**\" as the root cause. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" further supports this by stating, \"The vulnerability lies in the **lack of proper authorization** checks when accessing the task function.\" This evidence strongly suggests a problem related to authorization.\n\nThe Retriever Results listed several potential CWEs, including CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), CWE-472 (External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter), and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization). After reviewing the descriptions and relationships of these CWEs, CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) was determined to be the most appropriate.\n\nCWE-284 is a high-level Pillar, and the MITRE mapping guidance discourages its use in favor of more specific descendants. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) implies that an authorization check is performed but is done incorrectly, which doesn't align with the description stating a **lack of proper authorization checks**. CWE-472 (External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter) is not relevant as it deals with the manipulation of assumed-immutable parameters, which is not the core issue here. CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is a more general class and the description says to consider mapping to CWE-862 or CWE-863.\n\nCWE-862 (Missing Authorization) directly addresses the scenario where no authorization check is performed, which aligns precisely with the vulnerability description. Therefore, CWE-862 is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
