CWE-269 itself is a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). This indicates a hierarchical relationship where CWE-266 is a more specific instance of a broader access control issue. CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is a peer of CWE-269. These relationships influenced the decision to prioritize CWE-266 due to its specificity. The abstraction levels were considered, favoring the Base level (CWE-266) over the Class levels (CWE-269, CWE-285 and CWE-732) when the evidence supports it.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    \n    cwe266 -->|CHILDOF| cwe269\n    cwe269 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe266 primary\n    class cwe269,cwe284,cwe285,cwe732 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves an **incorrect privilege assignment** (CWE-266) leading to attackers gaining access to restricted functions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the **rootcause** identified as \"**incorrect privilege assignment**\" and the impact of allowing attackers to access restricted functions.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the hierarchical structure of the CWEs, guiding the choice towards the most specific applicable CWE.\n\nCWE-266 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the **incorrect privilege assignment**, which is the **rootcause** of the vulnerability as stated in both the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary.
