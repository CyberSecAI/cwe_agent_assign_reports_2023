While CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is a parent of CWE-126, the description specifically mentions \"buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations *after* the targeted buffer\", which aligns more precisely with the over-read condition. CWE-126 is a Variant of CWE-125 making it a more specific type of out-of-bounds read.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    \n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe125\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe126 primary\n    class cwe125 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively simple:\n\n1.  A crafted HTTP/HTTPS request is sent to the CODESYS web server.\n2.  The web server **incorrectly processes the request**, resulting in a **buffer over-read** (**CWE-126**).\n3.  The **buffer over-read** leads to a crash of the web server.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" which identify the **weakness** as a \"**buffer over-read**.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this by stating: \"Root cause of vulnerability: A **buffer over-read** in the CODESYS web server when processing specific crafted HTTP or HTTPS requests\" and \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: CWE-126: Buffer Over-read.\" The description of CWE-126 aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description, indicating that the product reads from a buffer using access mechanisms (indexes or pointers) that reference memory locations *after* the targeted buffer. This **buffer over-read** leads to a crash. CWE-126 is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is the preferred level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason for not selecting*: While an incorrect buffer size calculation could *lead* to a **buffer over-read**, the description does not explicitly state this is the root cause.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason for not selecting*: Integer underflow is not mentioned or implied in the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason for not selecting*: While related to memory management, the vulnerability description does not indicate that this is the root cause of the issue.\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason for selecting*: This is the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **buffer over-read**, and the description of CWE-126 perfectly matches this condition.\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason for not selecting*: While an off-by-one error *could* lead to a **buffer over-read**, the description does not explicitly state this is the root cause.\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason for not selecting*: The vulnerability is a **buffer over-read**, not an underwrite.\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason for not selecting*: While excessive memory allocation *could* lead to a **buffer over-read** indirectly, the description does not explicitly state this is the root cause.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason for not selecting*: While CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is related, CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read) is a more specific variant of CWE-125, and the vulnerability description specifies an *over-read* condition.\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason for not selecting*: While an incorrect length value *could* lead to a **buffer over-read**, the description does not explicitly state this is the root cause.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Reason for not selecting*: Resource shutdown is not mentioned in the vulnerability",
