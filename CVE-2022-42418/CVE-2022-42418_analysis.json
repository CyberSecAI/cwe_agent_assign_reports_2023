CWE-787 is a base CWE and child of CWE-119. CWE-119 is a class CWE. The relationships show a hierarchy from general buffer issues to specific out-of-bounds writes. The primary selection of CWE-416 is based on the evidence of dereferencing a user-supplied value as a pointer without validation, which could easily lead to a use-after-free condition if the memory is freed elsewhere.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe754[\"CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    \n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe754\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe787,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with a **lack of proper validation of a user-supplied value**. This leads to dereferencing it as a pointer. Depending on the state of the memory, this could lead to a **use-after-free** condition (CWE-416) or an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). The final impact is the ability to **execute arbitrary code**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed towards CWE-416 as the primary weakness due to the **lack of proper validation** and dereferencing a user-supplied value as a pointer. The key phrase from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section is \"**lack of proper validation of a user-supplied value prior to dereferencing it as a pointer**.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also supports this, stating that \"the program dereferences a user-supplied value as a pointer without proper checks\".\n\nThe Retriever Results suggested CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as a top candidate, and it is also a relevant consideration as a secondary weakness. If the memory being pointed to is still allocated but outside the intended boundaries, an out-of-bounds write could occur. The final decision favors CWE-416 as the primary weakness because the initial **lack of validation** combined with dereferencing could easily lead to a use-after-free if the memory has already been deallocated.\n\nThe selection of CWE-416 is at the Variant level, which is the most specific level supported by the available evidence. CWE-787 is added as a secondary weakness at the Base level. CWE-119 is considered but is too general and is discouraged for use when more specific CWEs are available.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
