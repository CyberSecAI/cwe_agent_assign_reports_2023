While CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is more general, CWE-121 specifically identifies the **stack** as the location of the buffer overflow, aligning precisely with the vulnerability description. CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is a higher-level class that encompasses various buffer-related weaknesses, but CWE-121 provides the necessary specificity for this case.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe787,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** A **stack overflow** occurs due to an unspecified error in the `UploadCustomModule` function when handling the `File` parameter.\n2.  **Impact:** The **stack overflow** can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other security breaches.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description provided. The key phrase \"stack overflow\" directly corresponds to CWE-121. The Retriever Results also strongly support CWE-121 as the primary candidate, with a score of 1.0.\n\nThe description explicitly states that the vulnerability is a **stack overflow** within the `UploadCustomModule` function, triggered by the `File` parameter. This aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-121, which is a \"stack-based buffer overflow condition.\" The CWE descriptions and relationships confirm that CWE-121 is the most specific and appropriate choice, providing adequate granularity for this vulnerability.\n\nI am overriding the consideration of other CWEs due to the explicit mention of \"stack overflow\", which maps directly to CWE-121. While other CWEs like CWE-190 (Integer Overflow) or CWE-78 (OS Command Injection) could potentially be related in more complex scenarios, the available information does not suggest their involvement in this specific instance.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nStack Overflow: \"Stack Overflow\" is often used to mean the same thing as stack-based buffer overflow, however it is also used on occasion to mean stack exhaustion, usually a result from an excessively recursive function call. Due to the ambiguity of the term, use of stack overflow to describe either circumstance is discouraged.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-788\nChildOf -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** Stack-based buffer overflows can instantiate in return address overwrites, stack pointer overwrites or frame pointer overwrites. They can also be considered function pointer overwrites, array indexer overwrites or write-what-where condition, etc.\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-35395:** Stack-based buffer overflows in SFK for wifi chipset used for IoT/embedded devices, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.",
