This CWE is a child of CWE-770, indicating that it's a specific case of allocating resources without limits. CWE-789, **Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value** is a peer of CWE-1325 and is a child of CWE-770 which indicates an alternative, related issue of allocating memory based on an excessive size value, also contributing to potential stack exhaustion. The selection of CWE-1325 is based on the fact that the vulnerability involves parsing a CGM file which can lead to multiple memory allocations and is a better fit than the other two CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1325[\"CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    \n    cwe1325 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    cwe1325 --|PEEROF| cwe789\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1325 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe789 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the parsing of a CGM file. The **lack of proper control** over memory allocation during parsing leads to **stack exhaustion**. The ultimate impact is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to the application crashing.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability based on the description and key phrases. The primary evidence is that \"the CGM_NIST_Loader.dll contains **stack exhaustion** vulnerability when parsing a CGM file\".\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the connection between uncontrolled resource allocation (CWE-770), excessive size values in memory allocation (CWE-789), and the specific scenario of improperly controlled sequential memory allocation (CWE-1325).\n\nCWE-1325 is selected as the primary CWE because it best represents the vulnerability, which involves uncontrolled allocation of memory while parsing a CGM file. This decision is based on the evidence in the description and the relationship analysis, ensuring the selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity. Other CWEs such as CWE-787, although listed as a primary match for similar CVE descriptions, were not selected because they did not accurately represent the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives a complex input with multiple elements or fields that must be consistent with each other, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually consistent.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive -
