CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a child of CWE-119. This shows a potential chain where type confusion leads to memory corruption through out-of-bounds writes.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe843[\"CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    \n    cwe843 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe843 primary\n    class cwe787,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **type confusion** (CWE-843) in the V8 engine, potentially leading to heap corruption, which might be exploitable through out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment points to CWE-843 (Type Confusion) as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**type confusion**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms \"**Type Confusion** in V8\" as the root cause. The retriever results also lists CWE-843 with a high score.\n\nThe relationship analysis and the vulnerability chain suggests that type confusion can potentially lead to memory corruption. Therefore, CWE-787 is considered as a secondary weakness.\n\nThe final selection is based on the provided evidence and the relationships between the CWEs. CWE-843 is the most specific and directly supported by the evidence, while CWE-787 is a potential consequence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-415: Double Free\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
