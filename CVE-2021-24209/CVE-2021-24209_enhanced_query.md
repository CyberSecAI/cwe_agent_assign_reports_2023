# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-24209

# Vulnerability Description

    The WP Super Cache WordPress plugin before 1.7.2 was affected by an authenticated (admin+) RCE in the settings page due to **input validation failure** and **weak $cache_path check** in the WP Super Cache Settings -> Cache Location option. Direct access to the wp-cache-config.php file is not prohibited, so this vulnerability can be exploited for a web shell injection.
