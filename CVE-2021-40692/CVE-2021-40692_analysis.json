The vulnerability description indicates that the authorization check was performed, but it was done incorrectly. CWE-863 is a child of CWE-285 Improper Authorization, and CWE-284 Improper Access Control. CWE-1220, Insufficient Granularity of Access Control, a Base-level CWE, is a more specific description of the authorization issue. It describes that the access controls lack the required granularity which results in unauthorized access.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe1220[\"CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe1220 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe1220 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient capability checks**, leading to teachers being able to download users outside of their courses. This is a direct result of **incorrect authorization**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed to CWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description stating \"**insufficient capability checks** made it possible for teachers to download users outside of their courses.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also indicates \"**root_cause**: Insufficient capability checks.\" and \"**weaknesses**: Inadequate access control, Authorization bypass\".\n\nCWE-863 is a Class-level CWE, and the guidance suggests examining its children for a better fit. CWE-1220, Insufficient Granularity of Access Control, is a potential candidate since the access control policy might be too broad, allowing unauthorized access. However, the primary issue is that the authorization check was incorrectly performed, so CWE-863 remains the primary CWE. CWE-1220 is added as a secondary CWE to provide more context.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence that the authorization check was not correctly implemented (CWE-863), allowing the teachers to download user data from courses they were not authorized to access.\nThe CWEs selected are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-863 capturing the primary issue and CWE-1220 providing additional context.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:",
