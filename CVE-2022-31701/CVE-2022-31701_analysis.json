This aligns strongly with **CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function)**. The vulnerability description states: \"An unauthenticated endpoint allows access to system information.\" This directly supports the selection of CWE-306 as the primary weakness. **CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere)** is a secondary concern as it describes the potential impact of the missing authentication, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n\nThe retriever results also support **CWE-306** as the top candidate, and while **CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication)** and **CWE-287 (Improper Authentication)** were also considered, the description explicitly states that authentication is missing, making CWE-306 the most accurate representation of the vulnerability. CWE-284 is too high level to be useful.\n\nI considered **CWE-287 (Improper Authentication)**, **CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication)**, and **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)** but did not use them.\n- **CWE-287** is too general and discouraged.\n- **CWE-1390** suggests that some authentication exists but is weak. In this case, authentication is missing entirely.\n- **CWE-284** is too high level and is discouraged.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-306** is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately captures the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the absence of authentication for a critical function. This is a base-level CWE, which is preferred over higher-level classifications.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
