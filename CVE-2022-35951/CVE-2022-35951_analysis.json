CWE-190 is a **childof** CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation). CWE-122 is a **childof** CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write). The abstraction level influenced the selection as the base level CWE-190 precisely captures the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe682[\"CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    \n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe122\n    cwe190 -->|CHILDOF| cwe682\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe122 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow (CWE-190)**, leading to a subsequent **heap overflow (CWE-122)**, and potentially resulting in remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is due to an **integer overflow (CWE-190)** when executing an `XAUTOCLAIM` command with a specially crafted `COUNT` argument on a stream key in Redis versions 7.0.0 to 7.0.4. This **integer overflow** can lead to a subsequent heap overflow, which can potentially lead to remote code execution.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description states: \"Executing an `XAUTOCLAIM` command on a stream key in a specific state, with a specially crafted `COUNT` argument may cause an **integer overflow**, a subsequent heap overflow, and potentially lead to remote code execution.\" Also, the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms: \"Root Cause of Vulnerability: Integer overflow in the `XAUTOCLAIM` command's `COUNT` argument... Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present: Integer overflow leading to a heap overflow.\"\n\nCWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) is selected as the primary CWE because the **root cause** of the vulnerability is specifically an **integer overflow**. The retriever results also identify CWE-190 as the top combined result.\n\nCWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is considered a secondary CWE as it is a consequence of the integer overflow. It is not the direct **root cause**, but a resulting condition.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity as they accurately capture the **root cause** and a significant consequence of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
