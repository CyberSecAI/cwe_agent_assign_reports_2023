CWE-777 and CWE-185 are related to regular expression issues. CWE-777 is a variant that refers to regular expressions that lack anchors, while CWE-185 is a class that refers to an incorrect regular expression. CWE-1333 is related to CWE-407 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) because inefficient regular expressions can lead to excessive CPU consumption, which aligns with the denial-of-service impact described in the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe777[\"CWE-777: Regular Expression without Anchors\"]\n    cwe185[\"CWE-185: Incorrect Regular Expression\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    cwe777 -->|CHILDOF| cwe625[\"CWE-625: Permissive Regular Expression\"]\n    cwe625 -->|CHILDOF| cwe185\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe777,cwe185 secondary\n    class cwe407,cwe625 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **inefficient regular expression** (CWE-1333) in the `url2` method. This leads to excessive backtracking and high CPU consumption, ultimately resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly suggests that the primary weakness is CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity), given the description explicitly mentions \"exponential ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service)\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further supports this by stating, \"The vulnerability is caused by an **inefficient regular expression** used in the `url2` method, which can lead to exponential backtracking when processing crafted input strings,\". This aligns perfectly with the CWE-1333 description: \"The product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.\"\n\nCWE-777 (Regular Expression without Anchors) was considered because regular expressions can be inefficient due to a lack of proper anchors. However, the description focuses more on the exponential nature of the complexity, making CWE-1333 a better fit. The vulnerability description highlights the \"exponential ReDoS\", pointing to a specific type of regular expression inefficiency, rather than simply a lack of anchoring. CWE-185 (Incorrect Regular Expression) is a more general class of regular expression errors that could contribute to inefficiency, but CWE-1333 is more specific and directly addresses the root cause.\n\nTherefore, the selection of CWE-1333 is at the optimal level of specificity, accurately reflecting the weakness described in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-625: Permissive Regular Expression\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a regular expression that does not sufficiently restrict the set of allowed values.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-185: Incorrect Regular Expression\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product specifies a regular expression in a way that causes data to be improperly matched or compared.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
