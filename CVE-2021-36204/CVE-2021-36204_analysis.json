The relationships between CWE-522 and its children, specifically CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) and CWE-523 (Unprotected Transport of Credentials), were considered. CWE-200 is a parent of CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information) and is related to information exposure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe523[\"CWE-523: Unprotected Transport of Credentials\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe523 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe209 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe523 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe312\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe522 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe256,cwe523,cwe312,cwe209 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Insufficiently Protected Credentials** (CWE-522), leading to the exposure of credentials in plain text through API calls. This exposure represents a loss of confidentiality (CWE-200) because the credentials are now accessible to unauthorized users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **Insufficiently Protected Credentials**. The vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary both explicitly state this. The **impact** is the exposure of credentials in plain text.\n\nCWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is selected as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the **root cause** described in the vulnerability. The vulnerability description key phrases also support this selection. However, CWE-522 is a Class-level CWE, which means more specific Base or Variant level CWEs might be more appropriate.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is considered a secondary CWE because the **impact** of the vulnerability is the exposure of credentials. However, CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE and is often misused to represent the impact rather than the root cause.\n\nCWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) is also considered as a secondary CWE because the credentials are exposed in plain text. While the initial issue might be the protection mechanism, the fact that the credentials exist in a form that can be exposed as plain text is relevant.\n\nThe final decision is to map to CWE-522 as the primary CWE, acknowledging that it is a Class-level CWE, but it directly addresses the stated **root cause**. CWE-200 and CWE-312 are added as secondary CWEs to reflect the **impact** of the vulnerability. The evidence is primarily based on the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which explicitly mention the **Insufficiently Protected Credentials**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-213: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product's intended functionality exposes information to certain actors in accordance with the developer's security policy, but this information is regarded as sensitive according to the intended security policies of other stakeholders such as the product's administrator, users, or others whose information is being processed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-211: Externally-Generated Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an operation that triggers an external diagnostic or error message that is not directly generated or controlled by the product, such as an error generated by the programming language interpreter that a software application uses.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE",
