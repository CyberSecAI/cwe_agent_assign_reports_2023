This indicates a hierarchical relationship where CWE-862 is a more specific case of the broader authorization issues described by its parents.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check. This **lack of authorization** allows attackers to access resources they should not, leading to unauthorized access and potential data tampering.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **missing authorization** as the root cause. The commit details confirm that the application **fails to check** user permissions before allowing actions like commenting or rating videos, particularly private ones. This directly aligns with CWE-862 **Missing Authorization**.\n\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly:\n\n*   \"**rootcause:** **missing authorization**\" from the Vulnerability Description Key Phrases.\n*   \"The commit addresses a vulnerability related to access control when creating comments and ratings on videos. Specifically, the issue was that the application was **not properly checking** if a user had the right to access a video before allowing them to create comments or ratings.\" from CVE Reference Links Content Summary.\n*   \"**Inadequate Access Control:** The primary vulnerability was the **lack of proper access control checks** before allowing users to comment or rate videos.\" from CVE Reference Links Content Summary.\n*   The code examples that implemented  `checkCanSeeVideoIfPrivate` to prevent unauthorized access to private videos.\n\nThe graph relationships highlight that CWE-862 is a specific type of access control issue, making it more appropriate than its parents, CWE-285 and CWE-284. This selection is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the **missing authorization** check identified as the **root cause**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
