CWE-113 [Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')] is a variant of CWE-93 and a more specific case related to HTTP headers. CWE-444 [Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')] describes the impact of the CRLF injection, leading to request smuggling. These CWEs form a chain: CRLF injection leads to potential HTTP request smuggling due to inconsistent interpretation of requests.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\"]\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    cwe444[\"CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')\"]\n    \n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe93\n    cwe93 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe444\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe93 primary\n    class cwe113,cwe444 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of sanitization** of user-provided input, leading to **CRLF injection** (CWE-93). This then leads to the possibility of injecting arbitrary headers and new HTTP requests, resulting in **HTTP request smuggling** (CWE-444). The final impact is the potential for further attacks due to the ability to manipulate the injected requests.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identifies the **CRLF injection** as the primary weakness. The retriever results also highlight CWE-93 [Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')] as a relevant CWE. The vulnerability description clearly states that the `undici` library **fails to sanitize** user input used in the `content-type` header, allowing for **CRLF injection**. The evidence to support this includes the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" which has \"**weakness: CRLF injection**\" and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" stating \"**CRLF Injection: The primary vulnerability is a CRLF injection (CWE-93)**\".\n\nThe relationship graph further supports the selection of CWE-93, CWE-113 and CWE-444, as they form a logical chain of cause and effect. CWE-93 is the root cause, CWE-113 is a specific variant related to HTTP headers, and CWE-444 is the potential impact.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-93 directly describes the injection of CRLF sequences, while CWE-113 specifies that this occurs within HTTP headers, and CWE-444 describes the resulting request smuggling.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*CWE-80 was not selected because this vulnerability is not related to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).*\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*CWE-74 was considered but not selected because it's a high-level class, and CWE-93 is a more specific base CWE that accurately describes the vulnerability.*\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*CWE-184 was considered but not selected because there's no specific evidence suggesting an incomplete list of disallowed inputs; the vulnerability is due to the **lack of sanitization** of CRLF sequences, not an incomplete list.*\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*CWE-1289 was not selected because the vulnerability is not specifically related to resource identifier validation, but the more general issue of CRLF injection due to **lack of sanitization**.*\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
