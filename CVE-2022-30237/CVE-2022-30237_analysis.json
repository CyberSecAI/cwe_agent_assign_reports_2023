While CWE-311 has more specific children like CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage) and CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission), the description does not specify storage or transmission, so the Class-level CWE is more appropriate. The secondary CWE, CWE-261, is related because the description indicates that the encoding is **weak**, meaning it's not encryption but rather obfuscation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe261[\"CWE-261: Weak Encoding for Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe261 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe311 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe261 -->|PEEROF| cwe311\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe311 primary\n    class cwe261 secondary\n    class cwe522 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing encryption** of sensitive data (CWE-311), which is then further weakened by the use of a **weak encoding** (CWE-261). This leads to the impact of allowing attackers to recover authentication credentials.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment correctly identified CWE-311 as a primary candidate due to the explicit mention of \"**Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data**\" in both the vulnerability description and key phrases. The \"Retriever Results\" also lists CWE-311 as the top combined result.\nThe secondary CWE, CWE-261, was selected to show that a **weak encoding** led to authentication credentials being recovered.\n\nThe selection of CWE-311 is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description. The choice of CWE-261 is a refinement based on the encoding being weak and not actual encryption. Both CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity, with CWE-311 as a class and CWE-261 as a base.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
