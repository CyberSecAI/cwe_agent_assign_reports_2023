# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2022-30237

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-311 | Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-261 | Weak Encoding for Password | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-311, a Class-level CWE representing the **missing encryption** of sensitive data. While CWE-311 has more specific children like CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage) and CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission), the description does not specify storage or transmission, so the Class-level CWE is more appropriate. The secondary CWE, CWE-261, is related because the description indicates that the encoding is **weak**, meaning it's not encryption but rather obfuscation.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing encryption** of sensitive data (CWE-311), which is then further weakened by the use of a **weak encoding** (CWE-261). This leads to the impact of allowing attackers to recover authentication credentials.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment correctly identified CWE-311 as a primary candidate due to the explicit mention of "**Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data**" in both the vulnerability description and key phrases. The "Retriever Results" also lists CWE-311 as the top combined result.
The secondary CWE, CWE-261, was selected to show that a **weak encoding** led to authentication credentials being recovered.

The selection of CWE-311 is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description. The choice of CWE-261 is a refinement based on the encoding being weak and not actual encryption. Both CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity, with CWE-311 as a class and CWE-261 as a base.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).



## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
To fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-325: Missing Cryptographic Step
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not implement a required step in a cryptographic algorithm, resulting in weaker encryption than advertised by the algorithm.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an algorithm or scheme that produces insufficient entropy, leaving patterns or clusters of values that are more likely to occur than others.
