It is a child of CWE-77, which is a Class level CWE. CWE-78 is also related to CWE-88 (Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command), which is a peer relationship. This means that CWE-88 could also be a possible classification, but CWE-78 is more specific. The secondary CWE, CWE-770 is a parent to CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) and CWE-774 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits)\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe88[\"CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe774[\"CWE-774: Allocation of Resources Without Limits\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe78 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe88\n    cwe770 -->|PARENTOF| cwe789\n    cwe770 -->|PARENTOF| cwe774\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe88,cwe770,cwe789,cwe774 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** (CWE-78) of special elements in an OS command, leading to **command injection**, which results in remote code execution. Another vulnerability is the **insufficient rate limiting** (CWE-770) of ICMP packets, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition. A possible further step could be **incomplete list of disallowed inputs** (CWE-184) that allows **command injection**.\n  - Root Cause: **Improper Neutralization** (CWE-78) / **Insufficient Rate Limiting** (CWE-770)\n  - Weakness: **Command Injection**\n  - Impact: Remote Code Execution / Denial of Service (DoS)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **command injection** vulnerability, which is directly mentioned in the description. The retriever results and similar CVE descriptions strongly suggest CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command) as the primary CWE. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary provides additional information about a denial-of-service vulnerability, specifically due to a **lack of proper rate limiting of ICMP packets**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-78 is based on the clear indication of **command injection** in the vulnerability description. The retriever results and similar CVE descriptions support this classification. The hierarchical relationships and mapping guidance confirm that CWE-78 is the most specific and appropriate choice.\n\nThe addition of CWE-770 is based on the evidence from CVE Reference Links Content Summary of the **lack of proper rate limiting of ICMP packets**. This aligns with the description of CWE-770 as \"Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\".\n\nCWE-184 was considered because there might be an incomplete list of disallowed inputs that an attacker could use to inject commands.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root causes of the vulnerabilities described in the advisory. CWE-78 accurately represents the command injection vulnerability, while CWE-770 captures the denial-of-service condition caused by insufficient rate limiting.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Selected:** This is not related to the **command injection** vulnerability described.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
