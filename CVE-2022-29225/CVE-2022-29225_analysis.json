CWE-789 and CWE-770 are related in that they describe the memory allocation issues that arise from the amplified data. CWE-770 is a parent of CWE-789, indicating a general resource allocation issue leading to the specific problem of excessive memory allocation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe409[\"CWE-409: Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data (Data Amplification)\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    \n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    cwe770 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe409\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe409 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe789 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the receipt of highly compressed data, leading to data amplification, then excessive memory allocation, and ultimately a denial-of-service.\n  - **Root Cause:** Improper handling of highly compressed data (CWE-409).\n  - **Weakness:** Allocation of resources without limits or throttling (CWE-770).\n  - **Impact:** Memory allocation with excessive size value (CWE-789), leading to denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, especially the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" and \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\".\n\nThe **rootcause** is that the decompressors **accumulate decompressed data into an intermediate buffer before overwriting the body** in the decode/encodeBody, which leads to the decompressor being able to be zip bombed. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this, stating \"Decompressors accumulate decompressed data into an intermediate buffer before overwriting the body in the decode/encodeBody.\" It also highlights that \"The vulnerability stems from the **lack of proper checks on the ratio between compressed and decompressed data sizes**, allowing for 'zip bomb' attacks.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the connection between resource allocation issues and memory allocation problems. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the vulnerability's root cause and its direct consequences. CWE-409 captures the data amplification aspect, while CWE-789 and CWE-770 detail the memory allocation issues.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
