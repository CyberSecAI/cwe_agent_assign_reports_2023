While it's discouraged to use class-level CWEs, the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**improper input validation**\" as the **rootcause**. The retriever results also list CWE-20 as the top result. CWE-20 has children CWEs, but based on the description, there is not enough information to be more specific.\n\nThe secondary CWE is CWE-94 **Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')**. This CWE is considered because the impact is remote code execution. CWE-94 is a child of CWE-74 **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')**. CWE-94 also has a usage of \"Allowed-with-Review\" because it is frequently misused.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe94 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20), which leads to remote code execution. It is possible that the input is used to generate code (CWE-94).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment and criticism result in a primary classification of CWE-20 **Improper Input Validation** and a secondary classification of CWE-94 **Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')**.\n\nThe assessment relies heavily on the explicit mention of \"**improper input validation**\" in the vulnerability description's key phrases. The phrase directly indicates the nature of the vulnerability. The description also has the phrase \"remote code execution\" for impact, which leads to the secondary classification of CWE-94.\n\nThe graph relationships highlight the hierarchical structure, with CWE-94 as a child of CWE-74, which is a more general injection category. Since CWE-94 is code injection, it is chosen as the secondary CWE.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, with CWE-20 at the class level due to lack of more specific information and CWE-94 at the base level because the impact is code execution.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n- CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')",
