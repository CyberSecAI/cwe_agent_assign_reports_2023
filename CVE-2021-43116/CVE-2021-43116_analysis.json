It relates to the use of default keys, which the CVE description supports. CWE-287, Improper Authentication, is a parent Class of several more specific Base CWEs, including CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) and CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication). However, the more specific CWE-1394 is more applicable than the more general CWE-287. CWE-288 is a peer of CWE-420 (Unprotected Alternate Channel).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1394[\"CWE-1394: Use of Default Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe420[\"CWE-420: Unprotected Alternate Channel\"]\n\n    cwe1394\n    cwe288\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe1390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe288 -->|PEEROF| cwe420\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1394 primary\n    class cwe288,cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a default cryptographic key** (CWE-1394). This leads to the ability to **bypass authentication** which allows the **malicious user to login**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided CVE description and the extracted summary. The key piece of evidence is the **root cause** which is an \"**Access Control vulnerability**\" where the returned package is changed to allow the attacker to login. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" adds more detail: \"The vulnerability stems from the **use of a default, hardcoded JWT secret key** in Nacos's authentication mechanism. This default key allows an attacker to forge valid authentication tokens.\" This clearly points to CWE-1394, \"Use of Default Cryptographic Key.\"\n\nCWE-287, Improper Authentication, and CWE-288 Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel were considered, but they are not as precise as CWE-1394 given the available information.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, particularly CWE-1394, which directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
