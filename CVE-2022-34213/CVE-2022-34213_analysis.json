It is a child of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials), which is a Class level CWE. CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) is also a Base level CWE and a child of CWE-522. The hierarchical relationship indicates that CWE-260 and CWE-256 are more specific instances of CWE-522.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe260[\"CWE-260: Password in Configuration File\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe260 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe260 primary\n    class cwe256,cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **unencrypted storage of the password** in the configuration file (CWE-260). This leads to the **exposure of the password**, which can then be viewed by unauthorized users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the plugin stores passwords **unencrypted** in its global configuration file. The **root cause** is the **unencrypted storage of sensitive information**. This directly aligns with CWE-260 (Password in Configuration File), which describes storing a password in a configuration file that might be accessible to unauthorized actors. The impact is that users with access to the Jenkins controller file system can view the passwords.\n\nCWE-260 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. It is also more specific than CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials), which is a Class level CWE. While CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) is also a valid candidate, CWE-260 is a slightly better fit because it explicitly mentions the configuration file.\n\nThe retriever results list CWE-260 as the top candidate, further supporting this assessment. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms that the **root cause** is the **unencrypted storage of passwords**.\n\nTherefore, based on the vulnerability description, the retriever results, and the CWE specifications, CWE-260 is the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-693: Protection Mechanism

defense against directed attacks against the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n*This CWE was not selected since it is a high-level abstraction, and more specific CWEs are available.*\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected since CWE-260

Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected since CWE-260 is more specific to the storage of passwords in a configuration file.*\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This CWE was not selected since the vulnerability is not about the strength of the credentials, but about how they are stored.*\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected since the vulnerability is not about relying on untrusted inputs.*\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected since the vulnerability is not about transmitting data,

credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected since the vulnerability is not about hard-coded credentials.*\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected since the vulnerability is not about the improper removal of sensitive information.*\n\n## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product violates well-established principles for secure design.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
