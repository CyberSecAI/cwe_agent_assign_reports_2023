CWE-787 **Out-of-bounds Write** is a **ChildOf** CWE-119.

The retriever results and the explicit mention of \"**integer overflow**\" in the \"**rootcause:**\" section of the \"**Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**\" strongly supports CWE-190 as the primary CWE. The \"**weakness:**\" is \"**Memory Corruption**\". The relationship graph shows that an integer overflow can precede a buffer overflow, which is a type of memory corruption. Therefore, CWE-787 is included as a secondary CWE, indicating the likely consequence of the overflow.\n\nThe evidence provided is sufficient to confidently assign CWE-190 as the primary weakness. The relationship analysis further supports the inclusion of CWE-787 as a related weakness. Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, providing an appropriate level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: alternate_terms\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
