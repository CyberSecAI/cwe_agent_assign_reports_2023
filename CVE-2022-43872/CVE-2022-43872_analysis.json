It falls under the broader category of CWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**), but is more specific. CWE-639 (**Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key**) is a Base-level CWE and a child of both CWE-863 and CWE-284, representing a more specific case where authorization is bypassed through manipulation of a user-controlled key.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with **incorrect authorization checks**, leading to unauthorized access to technical information.\n  - Root Cause: **Incorrect Authorization Checks**\n  - Weakness: Improper access control.\n  - Impact: Access to unauthorized technical information\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **incorrect authorization checks** as the root cause. The description explicitly states that authorization checks are done incorrectly for some HTTP requests, which allows getting unauthorized technical information.\n\nCWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**) closely matches the vulnerability description, as it refers to scenarios where authorization checks are performed but are not done correctly. The \"Usage\" for CWE-863 is \"Allowed-with-Review\" because it is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate.\n\nCWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**) was also considered because it covers cases where the product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check. However, since the description specifies that authorization checks *are* performed, but *incorrectly*, CWE-863 is a more precise fit than CWE-285. The \"Usage\" for CWE-285 is \"Discouraged\" because it is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead.\n\nCWE-639 (**Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key**) was also considered because it describes how one user might gain access to another user's data by modifying the key value identifying the data. The provided vulnerability description doesn't provide specifics about how the authorization is bypassed, so CWE-639 is possible, but not confirmed. The \"Usage\" for CWE-639 is \"Allowed\".\n\nThe final selection favors CWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**) as the primary CWE because it directly reflects the **incorrect authorization checks** described in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions is not set, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
