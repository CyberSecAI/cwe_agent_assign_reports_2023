The password change mechanism does not require the original password or another authentication factor. CWE-341 (Predictable from Observable State) is potentially related because the time value used to generate the secret recovery code is easily predictable. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) is a high-level pillar that is discouraged.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe620[\"CWE-620: Unverified Password Change\"]\n    cwe341[\"CWE-341: Predictable from Observable State\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe620 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe620 -->|RELATED_TO| cwe341\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n\n    class cwe620 primary\n    class cwe341 secondary\n    class cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **weak password recovery** mechanism using a predictable time value. This leads to a **brute-force vulnerability** allowing an attacker to perform an **account takeover** by resetting the password.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed towards **Incorrect Access Control**, however the CVE Reference Links Content Summary provided more details which allow for a more precise CWE selection. The password recovery function in `requests/user.php` uses `md5($time)` to generate a secret recovery code. This is the **weakness** allowing the attacker to perform a brute force attack because the time value is predictable.\n\nCWE-620 (Unverified Password Change) is a good fit because the product does not require knowledge of the original password, or using another form of authentication when setting a new password. This aligns with the vulnerability description where an attacker can reset the password without any original authentication.\n\nCWE-341 (Predictable from Observable State) is related because the weakness is that the `md5($time)` is predictable.\n\nCWE-284 (Improper Access Control) is too high-level and is discouraged.\n\n**Justification:**\n- The primary CWE, CWE-620, is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.\n- The vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary provide sufficient evidence to support this classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
