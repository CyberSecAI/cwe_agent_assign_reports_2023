The other CWEs, CWE-1325 and CWE-770, are related to resource allocation and limits. CWE-1325 represents improperly controlled sequential memory allocation, which could be a contributing factor to the **stack exhaustion** caused by the uncontrolled recursion. CWE-770 describes allocation of resources without limits or throttling which could cause memory exhaustion.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe674[\"CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\"]\n    cwe834[\"CWE-834: Excessive Iteration\"]\n    cwe1325[\"CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe674 -->|CHILDOF| cwe834\n    cwe1325 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe674 primary\n    class cwe1325,cwe770 secondary\n    class cwe834,cwe400 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the deeply nested expression in the regular expression, leading to uncontrolled recursion in `regexp.Compile`. This then causes **stack exhaustion**, which is a form of uncontrolled resource consumption and ultimately leads to Denial of Service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **stack exhaustion** caused by the deeply nested regular expression. The evidence clearly points to uncontrolled recursion as the root cause.\n\n*   **CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion** is the primary weakness because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions **stack exhaustion** due to a deeply nested expression, which aligns with the characteristics of uncontrolled recursion.\n*   **CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation** is a secondary weakness because the uncontrolled recursion likely involves allocating memory on the stack for each level of recursion. The \"Alternative Terms\" for CWE-1325 mentions that **stack exhaustion** is often encountered as a consequence of it.\n*   **CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling** is another secondary weakness because the `regexp.Compile` function allocates resources without properly limiting the depth of the nested expression.\n\nThe selection of CWE-674, CWE-1325 and CWE-770 is at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause and contributing factors of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or

Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size

preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**:

Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove
