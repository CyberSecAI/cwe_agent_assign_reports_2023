This is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) and CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) are considered as secondary CWEs. The relationships influenced the selection by providing a hierarchical understanding of the authorization issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe862 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe668\n    cwe862 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe201\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe668,cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission check** (**does not perform a permission check**) (CWE-862). This allows attackers to enumerate credential IDs, leading to potential unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n  - Missing Authorization (CWE-862) -> Exposure of Credential IDs -> Potential Unauthorized Access\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **root cause**, which is the **missing permission check** (**does not perform a permission check**) in the HTTP endpoint. The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference links clearly supports this. The primary CWE is CWE-862, which accurately represents the **lack of authorization** when accessing the endpoint. This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credential IDs. The relationship analysis helps in understanding the broader context of authorization-related weaknesses. The selection of CWE-862 is based on the evidence that there is a **missing authorization** check, allowing unauthorized access to credential IDs. The abstraction level is Class, and the mapping guidance suggests reviewing child CWEs, but none are a better fit.\n\nCWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) was considered because the missing authorization leads to exposing credential IDs to users with only Overall/Read permissions, but it's a high-level classification. CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) was also considered because the credential IDs are being exposed, but it's not the primary issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
