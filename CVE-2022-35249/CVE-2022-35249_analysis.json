Although CWE-200 is discouraged, it's the most fitting high-level classification, with CWE-359 offering a more specific, though not entirely representative, alternative. There are no applicable chain relationships.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe359 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** in the `getUserMentionsByChannel` meteor server method which leads to **information disclosure** of messages from private channels and direct messages.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the **information disclosure** vulnerability. The vulnerability description clearly indicates that the `getUserMentionsByChannel` meteor server method discloses messages from private channels and direct messages regardless of the users access permission to the room. This points to a **weakness** related to exposing sensitive information.\n\nThe **Retriever Results** highlight CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) as the top candidate. While CWE-200 is discouraged due to its generality, the vulnerability description aligns with its core definition: \"The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\" The description also matches CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor), which is a child of CWE-200, but that's less applicable since it is just messages and not necessarily private personal information.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-200 is based on the following evidence:\n\n*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** \"information disclosure\"\n*   **Vulnerability Description:** \"discloses messages from private channels and direct messages regardless of the users access permission to the room.\"\n\nWhile a more specific CWE would be ideal, the provided information doesn't give enough specifics to choose a more specific **authorization** or **permissions** issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1.00\n**Source**: alternate_terms\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available.
