While CWE-863 and CWE-639 offer more specific classifications related to authorization, the lack of precise details in the vulnerability description makes it difficult to definitively confirm either of these. CWE-863 is a `ChildOf` CWE-284, and CWE-639 is a `ChildOf` CWE-863. The higher-level CWE-284 is favored due to insufficient root cause details in the vulnerability description. The abstraction levels also influenced the decision, favoring the higher-level Pillar classification due to limited information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect access control** in the mobile application, leading to the impact of remote attackers being able to **bypass authorization**. Without more information, the chain is limited to this high-level sequence.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment heavily considered CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) due to the high-level description of the vulnerability: a mobile application allowing remote attackers to **bypass authorization**. This aligns with the general description of CWE-284, which covers products that do not restrict or incorrectly restrict access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.\n\nThe sparse retriever results also suggested CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key), but these were considered less appropriate due to the lack of specific details about the authorization mechanism and how it is being bypassed. CWE-285 is `Discouraged` and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) were also considered.\n\nThe final decision favors CWE-284 due to its high-level nature, aligning with the limited information available in the vulnerability description. While CWE-863 and CWE-639 are more specific, the lack of root cause details and weakness mechanisms in the provided evidence makes it challenging to definitively classify the vulnerability at a lower level. The primary evidence is the Vulnerability Description stating that the \"mobile application in Transtek Mojodat FAM (Fixed Asset Management) 2.4.6 allows remote attackers to **bypass authorization**.\" The use of CWE-284 follows the mapping guidance for the CWE since the alternatives (CWE-862, CWE-863, CWE-732, CWE-306, CWE-1390, CWE-923) aren't clearly supported by the evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
