The retriever results also highlighted several CWEs related to regular expressions, such as CWE-185 (Incorrect Regular Expression), CWE-625 (Permissive Regular Expression), and CWE-777 (Regular Expression without Anchors). However, the description explicitly mentions \"polynomial worst-case time complexity,\" which aligns perfectly with CWE-1333.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    cwe185[\"CWE-185: Incorrect Regular Expression\"]\n    cwe625[\"CWE-625: Permissive Regular Expression\"]\n    cwe777[\"CWE-777: Regular Expression without Anchors\"]\n\n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    cwe1333 -->|PEEROF| cwe185\n    cwe1333 -->|PEEROF| cwe625\n    cwe1333 -->|PEEROF| cwe777\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe407,cwe185,cwe625,cwe777 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **inefficient regular expression** (`shortcutMatch` in the `fromUrl` function). This leads to **polynomial worst-case time complexity**, which can be exploited by an attacker to cause **excessive backtracking** and ultimately a **denial of service**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly indicates that CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity) is the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via **regular expression shortcutMatch** in the fromUrl function in index.js. The affected regular expression exhibits polynomial worst-case time complexity.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the root cause is \"due to a regular expression (`shortcutMatch`) used in the `fromUrl` function, which exhibits polynomial worst-case time complexity leading to catastrophic backtracking.\" This directly aligns with the CWE-1333 description: \"The product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.\" The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0) due to the direct match between the vulnerability details and the CWE description. The \"Usage: Allowed\" mapping guidance for CWE-1333 further supports this decision. The other CWEs were considered but deemed less relevant because they didn't capture the specific issue of inefficient algorithmic complexity in a regular expression.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n#
