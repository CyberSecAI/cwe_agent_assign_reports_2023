CWE-416 is a Variant of CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference), and a child of CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiry). CWE-362 is a Class, and it can precede CWE-416. The relationship between the **race condition** and the **use-after-free** is that the **race condition** allows the memory to be freed while another thread or process is still using it, which leads to the **use-after-free**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource after Expiry\"]\n\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe362 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe416\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe362 secondary\n    class cwe825,cwe672 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition (CWE-362)** that leads to a **use-after-free (CWE-416)**. The impact of this vulnerability is local escalation of privilege.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates a **use after free** due to a **race condition**.\nThe primary CWE is CWE-416 Use After Free, because the vulnerability description specifically mentions this weakness.\nThe secondary CWE is CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'), because the vulnerability description specifically mentions a **race condition** as the root cause that leads to the **use after free**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-416 and CWE-362 is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions a \"**use after free** due to a **race condition**\". The Retriever Results also support these selections.\n\nThe relationships between the CWEs also influence the final selection. CWE-362 (Race Condition) can precede CWE-416 (Use After Free), indicating that the **race condition** is the cause and the **use-after-free** is the result.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-416 is a Variant, and CWE-362 is a Class.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Rationale for not selecting*: The vulnerability description does not provide sufficient detail to determine if the **race condition** is specifically within a thread. CWE-362 is a more general Class that covers **race conditions** regardless of whether they occur within a thread or between processes.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Rationale for not selecting*: While improper locking can lead to **race conditions**, the vulnerability description does not explicitly mention improper locking.\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Rationale for selecting*: The vulnerability description specifically mentions a **race condition**, making this a relevant CWE.\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Rationale for not selecting*: While improper synchronization can lead to **race conditions**, the vulnerability description does not explicitly mention improper synchronization.\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Rationale for not selecting*: The vulnerability description does not provide sufficient detail to determine if the **race condition** is specifically a TOCTOU **race condition**.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Rationale for not selecting*: This is a symptom of **use-after-free**, but the vulnerability description specifies **use-after-free** and a **race condition** which is more specific.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Rationale for not selecting*: The vulnerability description does not mention anything related to buffer size calculation or buffer overflows.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
