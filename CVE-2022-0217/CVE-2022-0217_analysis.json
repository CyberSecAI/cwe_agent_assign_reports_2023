CWE-611 is a closely related weakness, as both stem from **improper handling of XML entities**. They are peer vulnerabilities related to XML processing. The abstraction level of both CWE-776 and CWE-611 is Base, which is the preferred level.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe776[\"CWE-776: Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion')\"]\n    cwe611[\"CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\"]\n    cwe674[\"CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\"]\n    cwe405[\"CWE-405: Asleep on the Job\"]\n\n    cwe776 -->|CHILDOF| cwe674\n    cwe776 -->|CHILDOF| cwe405\n    cwe611 -->|PEEROF| cwe441\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe776 primary\n    class cwe611 secondary\n    class cwe674,cwe405,cwe441 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper restriction of XML features** allowed in parsed XML data. This leads to the **expansion of recursive entity references** (CWE-776), and potentially XML External Entity References (CWE-611). The final impact is Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-776 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of **expansion of recursive entity references**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating, \"The parser **does not restrict the expansion of recursive entity references defined in Document Type Definitions (DTDs)**, allowing for a \"Billion Laughs\" attack which consumes excessive resources.\" The analysis also notes the potential for CWE-611.\n\nCWE-776 is selected as the primary CWE because the **rootcause** described in the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary directly matches CWE-776's description. CWE-611 is considered a secondary issue because the CVE Reference Links Content Summary states \"Depending on the `libexpat` version being used, the vulnerability might allow for the expansion of XML External Entity References (XXE) which can lead to disclosure of sensitive information. (Not confirmed to be exploitable by the Prosody team).\"\n\nBoth CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level according to MITRE's mapping guidance.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
