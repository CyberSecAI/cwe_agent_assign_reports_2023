CWE-1390, Weak Authentication, is a child of CWE-287 and represents a more specific case of improper authentication. The relationship influenced the decision to consider both CWEs, with CWE-287 as the broader classification and CWE-1390 as a potential refinement, though the evidence points more directly to the general failure of authentication.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe1390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe1390 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **failure to reject locked accounts** during PAM authentication. This leads to the ability of a previously authorized user with a now-locked account to execute Salt commands.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description states that \"**PAM auth fails to reject locked accounts**.\" This indicates a **weakness** in the authentication process. The system is not properly checking the account status (locked/unlocked) during authentication. The impact is that a user whose account should be denied access is still able to run Salt commands. This vulnerability affects both local shell accounts and salt-api users.\n\nThe initial assessment strongly suggested CWE-287, Improper Authentication, due to the **failure to properly prove that the claim is correct**. The description and key phrases highlight the fact that locked accounts are not being rejected, which constitutes a breakdown in the authentication process.\n\nThe Retriever Results also suggest CWE-1390, Weak Authentication. While the vulnerability could be described as \"weak\", the core issue is that the authentication process is not behaving as expected. The system fails to properly validate the locked status of accounts.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description, \"**PAM auth fails to reject locked accounts**,\" supports the selection of CWE-287 as the primary classification because the system is **failing to properly authenticate users based on their account status**. While CWE-1390 is a related concern, the core issue is not that authentication is weak in general, but that it is completely bypassed for locked accounts. Therefore, CWE-287 is the most appropriate primary CWE. The CWE-1390 is added as the secondary CWE since this is considered a **weakness in the authentication process**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were
