# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2022-22967

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-287 | Improper Authentication | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-1390 | Weak Authentication | 0.8 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-287, Improper Authentication, which is a Class-level CWE. CWE-1390, Weak Authentication, is a child of CWE-287 and represents a more specific case of improper authentication. The relationship influenced the decision to consider both CWEs, with CWE-287 as the broader classification and CWE-1390 as a potential refinement, though the evidence points more directly to the general failure of authentication.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with the **failure to reject locked accounts** during PAM authentication. This leads to the ability of a previously authorized user with a now-locked account to execute Salt commands.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description states that "**PAM auth fails to reject locked accounts**." This indicates a **weakness** in the authentication process. The system is not properly checking the account status (locked/unlocked) during authentication. The impact is that a user whose account should be denied access is still able to run Salt commands. This vulnerability affects both local shell accounts and salt-api users.

The initial assessment strongly suggested CWE-287, Improper Authentication, due to the **failure to properly prove that the claim is correct**. The description and key phrases highlight the fact that locked accounts are not being rejected, which constitutes a breakdown in the authentication process.

The Retriever Results also suggest CWE-1390, Weak Authentication. While the vulnerability could be described as "weak", the core issue is that the authentication process is not behaving as expected. The system fails to properly validate the locked status of accounts.

The evidence from the vulnerability description, "**PAM auth fails to reject locked accounts**," supports the selection of CWE-287 as the primary classification because the system is **failing to properly authenticate users based on their account status**. While CWE-1390 is a related concern, the core issue is not that authentication is weak in general, but that it is completely bypassed for locked accounts. Therefore, CWE-287 is the most appropriate primary CWE. The CWE-1390 is added as the secondary CWE since this is considered a **weakness in the authentication process**.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses default credentials (such as passwords or cryptographic keys) for potentially critical functionality.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76

**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
