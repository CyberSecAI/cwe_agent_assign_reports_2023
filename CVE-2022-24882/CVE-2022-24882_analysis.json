CWE-1390 is a class-level weakness and a child of CWE-287, suggesting a broader authentication problem. Selecting CWE-230 provides a more accurate depiction of the **improper handling of the missing password value** and the **improper authentication abort**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe230[\"CWE-230: Improper Handling of Missing Values\"]\n    cwe229[\"CWE-229: Improper Handling of Input\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe230 -->|CHILDOF| cwe229\n    cwe1390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe230 primary\n    class cwe1390,cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper authentication abort** due to the **improper handling of the missing password value**. This leads to a potential authentication bypass.\n  - Root Cause: **Improper authentication abort** due to **improper handling of the missing password value**\n  - Weakness: NTLM authentication implementation does not properly check parameters.\n  - Impact: An attacker can potentially bypass authentication.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **improper authentication abort** due to the **improper handling of the missing password value**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms the root cause: \"The FreeRDP server-side NTLM implementation does not properly check parameters, specifically it does not abort on an empty password.\" The retriever results suggested CWE-230 (Improper Handling of Missing Values) and CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication).\n\nCWE-230 is the more specific and appropriate choice because the vulnerability stems from the server's failure to handle the missing password value correctly, leading to the **improper authentication abort**. CWE-1390 is a broader classification and less precise. While the vulnerability can lead to weak authentication, the root cause is the improper handling of the missing input.\n\nTherefore, CWE-230 is at the optimal level of specificity, directly addressing the root cause identified in the vulnerability description and supporting evidence. The evidence clearly indicates the server-side NTLM implementation **does not abort on an empty password**, aligning perfectly with CWE-230's description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced

Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check
