CWE-400 is a child of CWE-664, but is more specific to the resource consumption issue described in the vulnerability. CWE-1284 is a child of CWE-20 and is related to the malformed message content described in the vulnerability. The \"Usage\" for CWE-400 is discouraged, but it is the best fit for the information available and the alternatives are less specific.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe400 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664\n    cwe1284 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe1284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **malformed Class 3 common industrial protocol message with a cached connection**. This **malformed message** leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption** due to **lack of proper input validation**, which ultimately results in a **denial-of-service** condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **root cause** as a **malformed message** leading to a denial-of-service. The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** section provided more details, highlighting **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** and **lack of proper input validation** as key weaknesses.\n\nThe final decision was based on the available evidence, specifically the description of the vulnerability involving a **malformed Class 3 common industrial protocol message** causing a **denial-of-service** in Rockwell Automation Logix Controllers. This aligns well with CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption), as the controller **does not properly handle malformed CIP messages, leading to excessive resource consumption.** While CWE-400 is discouraged, it captures the essence of the vulnerability, where the system's resources are exhausted due to **improper handling of the malformed message**.\n\nCWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) was selected as a secondary CWE because the **malformed message** suggests a problem with how the input (message) is validated regarding its size or structure. This **lack of proper input validation** contributes to the uncontrolled resource consumption.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, capturing both the high-level impact (resource exhaustion) and a contributing factor (improper input validation).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.
