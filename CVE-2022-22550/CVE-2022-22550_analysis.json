The vulnerability description explicitly mentions password disclosure, indicating that the information was not properly protected, aligning with CWE-312's description. Other related CWEs like CWE-523 (Unprotected Transport of Credentials) were considered but deemed less appropriate as the vulnerability focuses on storage rather than transmission.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe311 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **weakness** of storing passwords in cleartext, leading to the **impact** of password disclosure and potential account takeover.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which explicitly states a \"password disclosure vulnerability.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section confirms this with the entry \"Root cause: Password disclosure vulnerability\" and \"Weaknesses: Password disclosure\". This directly corresponds to the description of CWE-312: \"The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by showing that CWE-312 is a base-level weakness under CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data), making it a more specific and appropriate choice than the higher-level CWE-311.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the storage of sensitive information in cleartext.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
