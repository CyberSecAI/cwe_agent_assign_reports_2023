CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) is a base CWE which can follow CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) and is PeerOf CWE-430 and CWE-436.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    cwe552[\"CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\"]\n\n    cwe434 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe73\n    cwe284 -->|PARENTOF| cwe434\n    cwe284 -->|PARENTOF| cwe552\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe434,cwe552 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with **improper access controls** (CWE-284), leading to the ability to upload arbitrary files (CWE-434), which can result in malicious file execution and potential remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **improper access controls** as the root cause, aligning with CWE-284. However, CWE-284 is a high-level Pillar, and the provided evidence suggests a more specific weakness: unrestricted file upload. The ability to upload arbitrary files due to **improper access controls** maps well to CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type). The retriever results also list CWE-434.\n\nThe evidence supports the classification. The vulnerability description key phrases highlight \"**improper access controls**\" and the impact of uploading arbitrary files. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the **lack of file extension and content-type checks** during file uploads.\n\nCWE-284 is a high-level, often misused CWE. It is discouraged to use this CWE when a lower-level CWE is more appropriate. Since there is a more appropriate CWE, CWE-434, it should be considered, but since the rootcause is stated as **improper access controls** it is still included as the primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
