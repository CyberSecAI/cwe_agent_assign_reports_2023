# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-2368

## Vulnerability Description
**Authentication Bypass by Spoofing** in GitHub repository microweber/microweber prior to 1.2.20.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Authentication Bypass by Spoofing**
- **product:** microweber/microweber
- **version:** prior to 1.2.20

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content relates to a commit in the `microweber/microweber` repository on GitHub, specifically commit `53c000ccd5602536e28b15d9630eb8261b04a302`. This commit introduces a change in the `src/MicroweberPackages/User/UserManager.php` file, adding a new login attempt check. This check examines the `REMOTE_ADDR` server variable and blocks logins from an IP address after 25 failed login attempts within the last 15 minutes.

Here is a breakdown of the commit:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

-   The commit seems to be addressing a potential vulnerability related to brute-force login attempts. The code prior to this commit might not have adequately protected against rapid login attempts from the same IP address, potentially allowing attackers to exhaust resources or gain unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   Prior to the commit, the system was vulnerable to brute-force login attacks due to a lack of sufficient IP-based rate limiting. The vulnerability lies in the absence of a check on the `REMOTE_ADDR` to block repeated login attempts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   The impact of exploiting this vulnerability (prior to this patch) could have allowed attackers to perform brute-force attacks on user accounts, potentially leading to account compromise.
-   Without protection, the system could become unavailable due to the high load of failed login attempts.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The attack vector is through the login form, by sending numerous login requests with incorrect credentials from the same IP address.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the login page. They would also need to make these requests rapidly enough to trigger the failed login counter, demonstrating the need to have multiple attempts from the same source IP in a short time.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The commit adds a check using `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` which attempts to identify the source IP address for rate limiting.
-   The new code checks the number of failed login attempts from a specific IP address in the last 15 minutes. If it exceeds 25, the login is blocked for 15 minutes.
-   The code implies that there are other checks, before and after this `REMOTE_ADDR` check, that examine different aspects of login attempts.
-   The commit description is simply "update" which does not provide much context as to the intention of the change.

This patch introduces a measure to mitigate brute-force attacks by IP-based rate limiting, but the information provided does not explicitly state if it is associated with CVE-2022-2368.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-1374:** The provided password is only compared against the first character of the real password.
- **CVE-2000-0979:** The password is not properly checked, which allows remote attackers to bypass access controls by sending a 1-byte password that matches the first character of the real password.
- **CVE-2001-0088:** Chain: Forum software does not properly initialize an array, which inadvertently sets the password to a single character, allowing remote attackers to easily guess the password and gain administrative privileges.




## CWE-350: Reliance on Reverse DNS Resolution for a Security-Critical Action
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product performs reverse DNS resolution on an IP address to obtain the hostname and make a security decision, but it does not properly ensure that the IP address is truly associated with the hostname.

### Extended Description


Since DNS names can be easily spoofed or misreported, and it may be difficult for the product to detect if a trusted DNS server has been compromised, DNS names do not constitute a valid authentication mechanism.


When the product performs a reverse DNS resolution for an IP address, if an attacker controls the DNS server for that IP address, then the attacker can cause the server to return an arbitrary hostname. As a result, the attacker may be able to bypass authentication, cause the wrong hostname to be recorded in log files to hide activities, or perform other attacks.


Attackers can spoof DNS names by either (1) compromising a DNS server and modifying its records (sometimes called DNS cache poisoning), or (2) having legitimate control over a DNS server associated with their IP address.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-290
ChildOf -> CWE-807
CanPrecede -> CWE-923

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** CWE-350, CWE-247, and CWE-292 were merged into CWE-350 in CWE 2.5. CWE-247 was originally derived from Seven Pernicious Kingdoms, CWE-350 from PLOVER, and CWE-292 from CLASP. All taxonomies focused closely on the use of reverse DNS for authentication of incoming requests.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-1488:** Does not do double-reverse lookup to prevent DNS spoofing.
- **CVE-2001-1500:** Does not verify reverse-resolved hostnames in DNS.
- **CVE-2000-1221:** Authentication bypass using spoofed reverse-resolved DNS hostnames.




## CWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs authentication based on the name of a resource being accessed, or the name of the actor performing the access, but it does not properly check all possible names for that resource or actor.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1390

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Overlaps equivalent encodings, canonicalization, authorization, multiple trailing slash, trailing space, mixed case, and other equivalence issues.

**[Theoretical]** Alternate names are useful in data driven manipulation attacks, not just for authentication.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2003-0317:** Protection mechanism that restricts URL access can be bypassed using URL encoding.
- **CVE-2004-0847:** Bypass of authentication for files using "\" (backslash) or "%5C" (encoded backslash).




## CWE-178: Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not properly account for differences in case sensitivity when accessing or determining the properties of a resource, leading to inconsistent results.

### Extended Description


Improperly handled case sensitive data can lead to several possible consequences, including:


  - case-insensitive passwords reducing the size of the key space, making brute force attacks easier

  - bypassing filters or access controls using alternate names

  - multiple interpretation errors using alternate names.



### Alternative Terms
None

### Additional Notes
**[Research Gap]** These are probably under-studied in Windows and Mac environments, where file names are case-insensitive and thus are subject to equivalence manipulations involving case.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2000-0499:** Application server allows attackers to bypass execution of a jsp page and read the source code using an upper case JSP extension in the request.
- **CVE-2000-0497:** The server is case sensitive, so filetype handlers treat .jsp and .JSP as different extensions. JSP source code may be read because .JSP defaults to the filetype "text".
- **CVE-2000-0498:** The server is case sensitive, so filetype handlers treat .jsp and .JSP as different extensions. JSP source code may be read because .JSP defaults to the filetype "text".




## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.

### Extended Description
When a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by interfering in the communication path between the host and client. The product might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the product might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host.

### Alternative Terms
