The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause is an incorrect buffer size calculation, aligning with CWE-131 (**CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size**). The relationship between these two CWEs is that an incorrect buffer calculation can lead to an out-of-bounds write.\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 (**CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write**) is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly represents the type of memory corruption occurring.
