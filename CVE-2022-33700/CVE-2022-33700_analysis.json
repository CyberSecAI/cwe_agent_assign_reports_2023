While CWE-200 is a broader class, CWE-532 directly addresses the vulnerability's root cause, making it the more appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe538[\"CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\"]\n\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe538\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe538 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of the following sequence:\n1.  **Root Cause:** Insertion of sensitive information (IMSI) into logs due to **improper logging practices**.\n2.  **Weakness:** The sensitive information in the log file is accessible to a local attacker.\n3.  **Impact:** A local attacker gains access to the IMSI, which can lead to privacy violations.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the exposure of sensitive information due to **improper logging**. The primary CWE considered was CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File), which aligns directly with the vulnerability description. The retriever results also support this choice.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that a local attacker can access the IMSI via logs due to **improper logging** in the `putDsaSimImsi` function. The CVE reference link content summary confirms that the **root cause** is the exposure of sensitive information due to **improper logging practices** and a **lack of proper sanitization** before logging.\n\nThe relationship analysis shows that CWE-532 is a child of CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor), but CWE-532 is more specific. The mapping guidance for CWE-200 discourages its use when more specific options are available.\n\nThe final decision to use CWE-532 is based on its direct relevance to the **root cause** described in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. CWE-532 is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\n**CWE-532** is selected as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the vulnerability: the product writes sensitive information to a log file. This aligns with the vulnerability description and the CVE reference link summary, which indicates that the **root cause** is due to **improper logging practices**.\n*   **How it matches:** The vulnerability description explicitly mentions that a local attacker can access the IMSI via logs.\n*   **Security Implications:** Exposure of sensitive information can lead to privacy violations.\n*   **Relationships:** Child of CWE-200, making it a specific type of information exposure.\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**CWE-200** was considered, as the overall impact of the vulnerability is an exposure of sensitive information. However, CWE-200 is a more general class of weakness.\n*   **Why not selected as primary:** Mapping guidance for CWE-200 discourages its use when more specific options are available. Since CWE-532 directly addresses the logging aspect, it is a better fit.\n*   **Security Implications:** Exposure of sensitive information can lead to privacy violations.\n*   **Relationships:** Parent of CWE-532.",
