CWE-377 is, in turn, a child of CWE-668, representing a broader class of exposing resources to the wrong sphere. The vulnerability description aligns most closely with CWE-379 because it specifies the creation of a temporary file in a directory with insecure permissions as the **root cause**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe379[\"CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions\"]\n    cwe377[\"CWE-377: Insecure Temporary File\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe379 -->|CHILDOF| cwe377\n    cwe377 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe379 primary\n    class cwe377 secondary\n    class cwe668 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **creation of a temporary file (CWE-379)** in a directory with global read permissions. This **insecure temporary file (CWE-377)** then leads to the **exposure of sensitive information (CWE-668)**, specifically the bcrypt hash of the single-user password.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified several potential CWEs, with CWE-379 having the highest relevance score. The selection is primarily based on the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which clearly states that the **root cause** is the writing of the Login Identity Providers configuration to the operating system temporary directory.\n\n\"When creating or updating credentials for single-user access, Apache NiFi **wrote a copy of the Login Identity Providers configuration to the operating system temporary directory**.\"\n\nThe hierarchical relationships among CWE-379, CWE-377, and CWE-668 guided the selection of the most specific CWE. While CWE-668 is a broader classification, CWE-379 provides a more precise description of the vulnerability. CWE-377 could be considered, but lacks the level of detail present in CWE-379.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately reflect the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **creation of a temporary file in a directory with insecure permissions (CWE-379)**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
