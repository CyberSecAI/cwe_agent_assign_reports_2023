CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read) is a variant that describes the specific type of out-of-bounds access that occurs. The relationship is that CWE-126 is a specific type of CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), which is a parent of CWE-126.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe805[\"CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\"]\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe805 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe125\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe805 primary\n    class cwe126 secondary\n    class cwe125 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **buffer access with incorrect length value** (CWE-805) which then leads to an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126) and ultimately results in a crash.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified several candidate CWEs based on the vulnerability description and retriever results. The primary **rootcause** is the **buffer access with incorrect length value**, which directly leads to the out-of-bounds read. The final decision was based on the evidence from the CVE description, which clearly stated that the `r_bin_java_inner_classes_attr_new` function did not properly verify the size of the attribute data before accessing it. This led to an out-of-bounds read, as confirmed by the commit message \"Improve boundary checks to fix oobread segfaults ##crash\".\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the weakness and its immediate consequence. CWE-805 captures the **rootcause**, while CWE-126 describes the specific type of out-of-bounds access.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified

Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 5448.41\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may\n         become a very small or negative number.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage",
