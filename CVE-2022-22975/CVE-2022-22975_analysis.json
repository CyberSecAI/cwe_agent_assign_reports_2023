CWE-90 directly addresses the **LDAP injection** vulnerability described. CWE-842 (Placement of User into Incorrect Group) is related, as the **LDAP injection** could lead to a user being placed into an incorrect group, but it's a consequence of the injection rather than the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe90[\"CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')\"]\n    cwe943[\"CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic\"]\n    cwe842[\"CWE-842: Placement of User into Incorrect Group\"]\n    \n    cwe90 -->|CHILDOF| cwe943\n    cwe90 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe842\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe90 primary\n    class cwe943,cwe842 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with a malicious user modifying their CN to include special characters. This input is then used in an LDAP query without proper neutralization, leading to **LDAP injection**. This injection allows the attacker to manipulate their group membership, potentially leading to unauthorized access or privilege escalation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions **LDAP injection** as the weakness. The CVE reference links content summary confirms this, stating that \"LDAP query injection vulnerability exists in Pinniped Supervisor's LDAP integration\" and that the \"application does not properly sanitize user-controlled input (the user's CN) when constructing an LDAP query.\" This directly aligns with the description of CWE-90.\n\nCWE-90 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction according to the mapping guidance. It accurately represents the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the improper neutralization of special elements in an LDAP query.\n\nCWE-842 is considered as a secondary CWE because the **LDAP injection** could result in a user being placed in an incorrect group, but the primary issue is the **injection** itself. The evidence supports focusing on the **LDAP injection** as the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product communicates with a host that provides a certificate, but the product does not properly ensure that the certificate is actually associated with that host.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
