In this case, CWE-327 and CWE-1394 are considered as potential children. The choice of CWE-326 is supported by the explicit mention of \"**Inadequate Encryption Strength**\" in the vulnerability description, making it a direct match.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe326[\"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe1394[\"CWE-1394: Use of Default Cryptographic Key\"]\n\n    cwe327 -->|CHILDOF| cwe326\n    cwe1394 -->|CHILDOF| cwe326\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe326 primary\n    class cwe327,cwe1394 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Inadequate Encryption Strength**, leading to unencrypted communication with the server.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-326 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of \"**Inadequate Encryption Strength**\" in the vulnerability description.
