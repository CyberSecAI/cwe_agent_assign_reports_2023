This can occur as a result of **improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer** `CWE-119`. When the buffer is allocated on the heap, then the specific variant `CWE-122` **Heap-based buffer overflow** applies.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe122,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a crafted TIFF image file processed by the `tiffcrop.c` utility. The **improper handling** of this file leads to a **heap buffer overflow**, resulting in an **out-of-bounds write**. This can cause an application crash and potential information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified `CWE-787` **Out-of-bounds Write** as the primary weakness due to the **heap buffer overflows** in `tiffcrop.c`. The vulnerability description explicitly states **\"Multiple heap buffer overflows in tiffcrop.c utility in libtiff library Version 4.4.0 allows attacker to trigger unsafe or out of bounds memory access via crafted TIFF image file which could result into application crash, potential information disclosure or any other context-dependent impact\"**. The **\"heap buffer overflows\"** **weakness** is confirmed in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section, which states: **\"Heap buffer overflow: The core issue is that during specific operations within the `tiffcrop` utility, memory is allocated on the heap and accessed beyond the allocated boundaries, leading to a buffer overflow. These overflows occur in multiple subroutines of `tiffcrop.c`.\"**\n\n`CWE-122` **Heap-based Buffer Overflow** is a variant of `CWE-787` **Out-of-bounds Write** and accurately represents that the buffer is allocated on the heap.\n\n`CWE-119` **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer** is a more general class of weakness and is the parent of `CWE-787` **Out-of-bounds Write**. While `CWE-119` applies, it is discouraged when a more specific CWE is available.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with `CWE-787` as the base, and `CWE-122` as the variant, accurately reflecting the **heap buffer overflow** vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code uses a variable that has not been initialized, leading to unpredictable or unintended results.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
