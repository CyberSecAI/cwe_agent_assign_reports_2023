CWE-353 is a base-level CWE, providing a specific description of the **missing support for integrity check**, aligning perfectly with the vulnerability. CWE-306 is included as a secondary weakness because the **lack of authentication or authorization** can be seen as a **missing authentication** component for the data packets. However, since the main focus is on the integrity check, CWE-353 is the primary concern.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe353[\"CWE-353: Missing Support for Integrity Check\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe353 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe353 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing support for integrity check** (CWE-353) and **missing authentication/authorization** (CWE-306) in the SRTP protocol. Because of these **missing** components, an attacker can inject manipulated data packets, potentially leading to remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability based on the description. The key phrase \"**missing support for integrity check**\" directly corresponds to CWE-353. The additional detail about \"**no authentication or authorization of data packets**\" suggests a secondary weakness related to authentication.\n\nThe final decision is based on the strong evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE reference, which explicitly states \"**Root Cause of Vulnerability: Missing support for integrity check**\". The retriever results also strongly support CWE-353 as the primary mapping.\n\nCWE-354 (Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value) was considered but not selected as the primary CWE, because the vulnerability description explicitly states that integrity checks are **missing**, not improperly validated.\nCWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) was considered and selected as a secondary weakness as the vulnerability also describes a **lack of authentication/authorization**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-353: Missing Support for Integrity Check\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a transmission protocol that **does not include a mechanism for verifying the integrity of the data** during transmission, such as a checksum.\n\n### Extended Description\nIf integrity check values or \"checksums\" are omitted from a protocol, there is no way of determining if data has been corrupted in transmission. The lack of checksum functionality in a protocol removes the first application-level check of data that can be used. The end-to-end philosophy of checks states that integrity checks should be performed at the lowest level that they can be completely implemented. Excluding further sanity checks and input validation performed by applications, the protocol's checksum is the most important level of checksum, since it can be performed more completely than at any previous level and takes into account entire messages, as opposed to single packets.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nPeerOf -> CWE-354\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
