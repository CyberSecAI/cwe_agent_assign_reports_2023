CWE-639 describes a specific case of incorrect authorization where a user-controlled key is used to bypass authorization.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe639 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **access control issue** where the application fails to properly check session permissions. This allows an attacker with low privileges to send a crafted HTTP request with a modified key value, leading to the creation of a superuser account.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-639, Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key. This is based on the vulnerability description stating \"attackers to arbitrarily create admin users via a crafted HTTP request.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section states: \"The application's access control management does not correctly check session permissions,\" and \"An attacker with low privileges such as 'Person Self-Login' or 'User' can create a superuser account with full administrative privileges.\" This aligns with the CWE-639 description: \"The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\"\n\nCWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, was considered as a secondary CWE because it is a broader category that encompasses the specific issue of bypassing authorization through a user-controlled key. However, CWE-639 is more specific and accurately reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-425, Direct Request ('Forced Browsing'), was also considered, but it does not accurately describe the vulnerability. While the attack involves a crafted HTTP request, the **root cause** is not the lack of authorization enforcement on specific URLs, but rather the ability to bypass authorization by manipulating a key value.\n\nThe choice of CWE-639 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **root cause**, which is the ability to bypass authorization by modifying a key value.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
