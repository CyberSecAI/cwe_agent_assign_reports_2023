The vulnerability description points to **weak authentication** and **incorrect handling of default credentials**. While CWE-1390 is a class, the specific issues of hardcoded and default credentials are more precisely captured by CWE-798 and CWE-1392 respectively. The relationship is that CWE-798 and CWE-1392 could be causes or variants of CWE-1390, but given the specific mention of **incorrect handling of default credentials**, and the implicit issue of **weak authentication** is likely caused by credentials, they are added as secondary issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe1392[\"CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe798 -->|PeerOf| cwe1390\n    cwe1392 -->|PeerOf| cwe1390\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1390 primary\n    class cwe798,cwe1392 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **weak authentication** and **weak password rules**, and leads to **incorrect default credential handling** for the Spectrum Copy Data Management Admin console. The initial flaws are in the authentication and password rules, which then result in the mishandling of default credentials.\n  - **Root Cause**: **Weak Authentication**, **Weak Password Rules**\n  - **Weakness**: **Incorrect Default Credential Handling**\n  - **Impact**: Unauthorized access to the Spectrum Copy Data Management Admin console.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **weak authentication**, **weak password rules**, and **incorrect default credential handling** as key issues. The retriever results pointed towards CWE-1390 as the primary candidate for **weak authentication**. The identification of **incorrect default credential handling** suggested CWE-798 and CWE-1392 as secondary issues which are related to but more specific than CWE-1390.\n\nThe graph relationships emphasize the connection between general **weak authentication** (CWE-1390) and the specific instances of **hard-coded credentials** (CWE-798) and **default credentials** (CWE-1392).\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately capture the nuances of the vulnerability, including the general problem of **weak authentication** and the concrete instances of **incorrect handling of default credentials** through **hardcoded** and **default credentials**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
