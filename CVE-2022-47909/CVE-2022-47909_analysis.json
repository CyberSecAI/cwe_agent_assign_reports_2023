CWE-89 is a specific type of data query injection, making it a more precise classification than the broader CWE-943. While the vulnerability involves injecting into LQL (Livestatus Query Language), the principles are the same as in SQL injection, due to the **improper input sanitization**. The description also mentions SSRF bypass to reach the vulnerable code which is not represented as a CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe943[\"CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe943\n    cwe943 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe943 secondary\n    class cwe74 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n\n1.  **Improper Input Sanitization (CWE-89/CWE-943):** The application fails to sanitize the `force_authuser` parameter.\n2.  **LQL Injection:** This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary LQL queries.\n3.  **SSRF Bypass:** SSRF allows the attacker to bypass localhost restrictions.\n4.  **Impact:** Direct queries to the core, potentially leading to sensitive data retrieval, data modification, and code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the description pointed towards a general injection issue. However, the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** and the **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** clearly indicated that the injection specifically targeted a data query language (LQL), which operates similarly to SQL.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-89 was primarily based on the following evidence:\n\n*   The **Vulnerability Description** mentions \"**SQL injection**\" as a **weakness**.\n*   The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** describes the injection of line feed characters to insert arbitrary LQL headers and queries, which is analogous to SQL injection techniques.\n*   The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** highlights that the `force_authuser` parameter was not being sanitized before insertion into the AuthUser header.\n*   The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** details the ability to retrieve sensitive data and potentially execute commands by forging LQL queries.\n\nCWE-943 was considered as a more general alternative, but CWE-89 was chosen due to its specificity and the direct mention of SQL injection principles. The choice aligns with the principle of selecting the most specific CWE that accurately represents the vulnerability. While LQL is not SQL, the injection mechanism and impact are similar enough to warrant using CWE-89 due to the lack of a specific CWE for LQL injection.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately capture the nature of the **improper input sanitization** that led to the vulnerability.\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a query intended to access or manipulate data in a data store such as a database, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that can modify the intended logic of the query.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
