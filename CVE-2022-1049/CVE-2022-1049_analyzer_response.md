## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is the hierarchical relationship between CWE-287 **Improper Authentication** and its child CWEs. While multiple child CWEs are considered, CWE-287 itself is chosen due to the lack of specific details to pinpoint a more precise cause. CWE-620 **Unverified Password Change** and CWE-613 **Insufficient Session Expiration** are considered as secondary candidates because they could potentially contribute to the authentication issue. However, these are not definitively confirmed by the evidence. The abstraction levels are also considered with the goal of selecting the most specific and relevant CWE.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper authentication** mechanism in the Pacemaker configuration tool (pcs). The pcs daemon allowed expired accounts and accounts with expired passwords to log in when using PAM authentication. This leads to the impact of unprivileged expired accounts that have been denied access still being able to log in. A potential secondary weakness is that password changes might not be adequately verified (CWE-620), and session expirations might be insufficient (CWE-613).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified that the root cause of the vulnerability lies in the **improper authentication** mechanism, specifically related to how the Pacemaker configuration tool handles expired accounts. The CVE description clearly states that the pcs daemon allowed expired accounts and accounts with expired passwords to log in when using PAM authentication. This aligns with the definition of CWE-287, which is **Improper Authentication**.

The retriever results suggested several CWEs, including CWE-1390 **Weak Authentication**, CWE-620 **Unverified Password Change**, and CWE-613 **Insufficient Session Expiration**. CWE-1390 is a parent of CWE-620, and CWE-613 can precede CWE-287. However, given that the core issue is that expired accounts are still allowed to log in, choosing **Improper Authentication** captures the essence of the vulnerability more accurately. The other two are secondary at best, as contributing factors.

The final decision is based on the available evidence, which highlights that the system **fails to correctly check if an account was expired** before allowing login through PAM. While a more specific CWE might be desirable, the provided information does not offer sufficient details to pinpoint a more precise cause. Therefore, CWE-287 **Improper Authentication**, is chosen as the primary CWE. The other candidates are noted as secondary considerations.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.81
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
