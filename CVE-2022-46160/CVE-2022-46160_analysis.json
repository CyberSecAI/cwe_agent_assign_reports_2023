This is a Class-level CWE, and while it has potential Base-level children, the provided information does not give enough detail to select a more specific child. CWE-863 is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is a sibling of CWE-863, representing a related but distinct type of authorization failure. The choice between them hinges on whether an authorization check was attempted but performed incorrectly (CWE-863) or if no check was performed at all (CWE-862). In this case, the description indicates that project level authorizations were **not properly verified**, implying that a check was attempted but **failed**. CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key is a child of CWE-863, but is not specific enough to be selected as the primary candidate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe862,cwe284,cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events in this vulnerability is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Project level authorizations are not properly verified** (Incorrect Authorization).\n2.  **Weakness:** Users not authorized to access a project\n3.  **Impact:** are able to get information provided by the widgets (e.g. number of members, content of the Notes widget...).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description and supporting evidence, points strongly to an authorization issue. The key phrase \"**project level authorizations are not properly verified**\" clearly indicates that the system attempts to perform authorization but does so incorrectly.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"project level authorizations are **not properly verified** when accessing the project homepage/dashboards. Users not authorized to access a project may still be able to get some information provided by the widgets\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating: \"**Improper Authorization (CWE-285)**: Project level authorizations are **not correctly checked** when displaying project dashboards/homepage. This allows users without proper access to potentially view information they shouldn't have access to.\"\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is the most appropriate choice because the system attempts to perform authorization, but the check is performed incorrectly. This contrasts with CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), where no authorization check is performed at all.\n\nCWE-285 is a parent Class of CWE-863 and is not as specific. CWE-284 is a Pillar and therefore too general. CWE-639 is related, but depends on a modifiable key being user controlled. The vulnerability description did not contain such details so is not specific enough.\n\nTherefore, CWE-863 is the most accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability, and it is at the optimal level of specificity based on the information provided.",
