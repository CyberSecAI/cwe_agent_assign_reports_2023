## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description is too vague to assign a specific CWE. The description only indicates a "Windows Runtime Remote Code Execution Vulnerability". The "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" only provides the impact of "Remote Code Execution" and the affected "product" as "Windows". No information is given on the root cause or the type of weakness. The retriever results return possible candidate CWEs to consider, but without any further information on the weakness, it is impossible to pick the best match. Because there is no evidence to support a specific CWE, I am assigning CWE-NVD-noinfo.
