CWE-917 is considered as a secondary weakness because the **unchecked JNDI lookup** can be exploited via expression language injection. CWE-73 is included as the attacker has control of file names or paths.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    cwe917[\"CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe502 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    cwe917 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe502 primary\n    class cwe917,cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **unchecked JNDI lookup**, which allows the attacker to control the data being **deserialized**. This **deserialization of untrusted data** leads to arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The primary weakness is CWE-502, as the vulnerability involves **deserialization of untrusted data**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary section specifically mentions \"Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502): The application deserializes untrusted data from JNDI, leading to arbitrary code execution.\"\n\nCWE-917 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')) is included as a secondary CWE because the JNDI lookup allows for expression language injection. The vulnerability description mentions an \"**unchecked JNDI lookup**\" which aligns with CWE-917.\n\nCWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) is included as the attacker has control of file names or paths, which is relevant in the context of configuring data stores with data sources located in JNDI.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they accurately represent the root cause and contributing factors to the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
