CWE-770 is related as the excessive CPU consumption can be seen as a form of resource exhaustion due to **allocation of resources without limits or throttling**. Choosing CWE-1333 as the primary CWE provides a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability's root cause compared to its parent, CWE-407.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    cwe1333 -->|IMPACT| cwe770\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe407,cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the application's **reliance on untrusted inputs** in the form of regular expressions provided through parameters like `filter` and `filterout`. The use of JavaScript's built-in `RegExp` engine, which is susceptible to catastrophic backtracking, combined with the **lack of input validation** on these regular expressions, leads to **inefficient regular expression complexity** (CWE-1333). This, in turn, causes abnormally high CPU usage, impacting the performance of the servers and potentially leading to a denial of service. In terms of **resource allocation without limits or throttling** (CWE-770), the application fails to restrict the amount of CPU time consumed by the regular expression engine, allowing an attacker to exhaust server resources.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the primary weakness is CWE-1333, **Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity**. This is supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary which states: \"The vulnerability stems from the use of a regular expression engine that is vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking and the fact that the application allows user-supplied regular expressions.\" This aligns directly with the description of CWE-1333, which notes that attackers can craft inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking, leading to a spike in CPU consumption.\n\nCWE-407, **Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity**, was considered due to its parent relationship with CWE-1333. However, CWE-1333 is more specific and directly addresses the issue of inefficient regular expressions, making it a better fit.\n\nCWE-770, **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**, was also considered because the **high CPU usage** resulting from the inefficient regular expressions can be seen as a form of resource exhaustion. The application does not limit the amount of CPU time consumed by these expressions, allowing an attacker to exhaust server resources.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1333 as the primary CWE is based on its specific relevance to the vulnerability and its base-level abstraction. This level of specificity provides a clearer understanding of the root cause compared to higher-level classifications. The high confidence score reflects the direct alignment between the vulnerability description and the characteristics of CWE-1333.\n\nThe choice of CWE-1333 is further supported by the fact that the vulnerability was initially fixed by switching to a backtracking-free regex engine (RE2), directly addressing the issue of inefficient regular expression complexity.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n* CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input - While the filter parameters take input, this is less about the quantity specified and more about the complexity of the expression.\n* CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection') - Not directly applicable as the issue is the regular expression's complexity, not direct code execution.\n* CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value - While the high CPU could lead to memory issues, it's not the primary problem.\n* CWE-20: Improper Input Validation - Too general; CWE-1333 is more specific to the ReDoS issue.\n* CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - Not applicable; the vulnerability doesn't involve forging server-side requests.\n* CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data - Not applicable; the vulnerability doesn't involve leaking sensitive information.",
