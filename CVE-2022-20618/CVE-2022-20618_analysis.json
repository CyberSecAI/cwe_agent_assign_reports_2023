It is related to CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), which is a parent. The relationship analysis indicates that while CWE-285 is a broader category, CWE-862 is more specific because it directly addresses the absence of an authorization check. CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is a secondary concern, as the lack of authorization leads to the exposure of credential IDs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe668 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission check** (CWE-862), leading to the enumeration of credential IDs. The attacker with Overall/Read access exploits this flaw. The final impact is the potential capture of credentials by exploiting other vulnerabilities due to the exposed IDs, which could involve CWE-522 if these credentials are not properly protected.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability description points to a **missing permission check**, which is confirmed by the CVE reference link content summary stating that the \"Bitbucket Branch Source Plugin does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.\" This directly aligns with CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). The retriever results also highlight CWE-862 as the top candidate. While other CWEs such as CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) are relevant, they represent potential impacts or related issues rather than the root cause, which is the **missing authorization**. The selection of CWE-862 is based on its direct relevance to the **missing permission check**, its high ranking in the retriever results, and the confirmation from the CVE reference. The abstraction level of Class is appropriate here, and a more specific Base level CWE is not available.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
