This is a child of the Class level CWE-377, which represents the general weakness of insecure temporary files. CWE-552 represents a broader case of making files accessible to external parties, which is a related concern.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe378[\"CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions\"]\n    cwe377[\"CWE-377: Insecure Temporary File\"]\n    cwe552[\"CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\"]\n\n    cwe378 -->|CHILDOF| cwe377\n    cwe377 -->|CHILDOF| cwe552\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe378 primary\n    class cwe377,cwe552 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause**: The `File.createTempFile` function creates files with world-readable permissions in the system's temporary directory. This leads to the impact: Sensitive information written to these files becomes visible to other local users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis concludes that CWE-378 (Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions) is the most appropriate primary CWE. This is supported by the evidence that the **root cause** lies in the creation of temporary files with overly permissive default permissions. The vulnerability description states: \"File.createTempFile creates files in the system temporary directory with world readable permissions\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also supports this: \"The vulnerability stems from the use of insecure temporary file creation...The library failed to set file permissions that would restrict access to only the creating user.\"\n\nThe retriever results also indicate CWE-378 as the top candidate. The MITRE mapping guidance allows for the usage of CWE-378 and states that \"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\"\n\nCWE-377 (Insecure Temporary File) was considered but is a Class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-378, thus less specific.\n\nCWE-552 (Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties) was considered, as the temporary files are created with world-readable permissions, making them accessible to other local users. While related, the core issue is the insecure creation of the temporary file itself, making CWE-378 more accurate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
