## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the selection was the direct match of the vulnerability description to the CWE-416 description. CWE-416 is a variant-level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The other potential CWEs were at higher levels of abstraction or did not directly relate to the **use after free** condition described in the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events for this vulnerability is as follows:
1.  A remote attacker convinces a user to engage in specific UI interactions via a crafted HTML page.
2.  This leads to a **use-after-free** condition (CWE-416) in the Sharing component of Google Chrome.
3.  The **use-after-free** results in **heap corruption**.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis strongly suggests CWE-416 as the primary weakness, and this is supported by the vulnerability description, key phrases, and CVE reference summary, all of which explicitly mention "**use after free**". The vulnerability description states, "Use after free in Sharing in Google Chrome prior to 101.0.4951.64 allowed a remote attacker who convinced a user to engage in specific UI interactions to potentially exploit **heap corruption** via a crafted HTML page." The 'Vulnerability Description Key Phrases' section lists "**use after free**" as the root cause. Finally, the 'CVE Reference Links Content Summary' section states "**Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-after-free in Sharing component."

The retriever results also list CWE-416 as the top combined result.

CWE-416 is a Variant level CWE, providing the right level of detail. The mapping guidance also suggests that CWE-416 is allowed and an acceptable-use case.

I considered other CWEs like CWE-366 (Race Condition within a Thread), CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow), and CWE-404 (Improper Resource Shutdown or Release), but these are either less specific or do not accurately describe the root cause of the vulnerability. For example, while the vulnerability leads to **heap corruption**, the root cause is the **use-after-free**, not directly a heap overflow.

Therefore, the analysis concludes that CWE-416 is the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.81
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
If two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, i.e., after the resource is no longer needed.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.

## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-415: Double Free
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-826: Premature Release of Resource During Expected Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource that is still intended to be used by itself or another actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 6869.15
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 6011.96
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a
