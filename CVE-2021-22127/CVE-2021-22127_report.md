## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced my decision was the ChildOf relationship between CWE-78 and CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command). This indicates that OS Command Injection is a specific type of command injection. Additionally, CWE-78 can also be a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')), highlighting that OS Command Injection is a form of injection. CWE-20 is a parent to CWE-1284 which relates to a quantity in the input, but the provided vulnerability description does not indicate what quantity is not validated, and it is more generally about the network name, so is not a good match.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper input validation** of the network name (SSID). This leads to the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an OS command, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands. Finally, this results in the execution of arbitrary code on the host operating system as root.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment pointed towards **CWE-78** due to the OS command injection flaw described in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary: "The application doesn't properly sanitize or validate the SSID, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands."
The **improper input validation** is the root cause described in the Vulnerability Description Key Phrases.

The primary CWE is **CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')**. The vulnerability description states that an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the host operating system by injecting commands into the network name. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-78, which involves constructing an OS command using externally-influenced input without proper neutralization.

The secondary CWE is **CWE-20 Improper Input Validation**. This is a more general weakness, but it's relevant because the root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper validation of the network name. The application should be validating the input to ensure that it does not contain any malicious commands. However, CWE-20 is discouraged because it is high level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.
