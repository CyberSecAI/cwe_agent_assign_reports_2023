CWE-319 is a more specific case of transmitting sensitive information without encryption, making it the more appropriate choice. Other relationships, such as those involving algorithm negotiation (CWE-757) or cookie handling (CWE-784), were not directly applicable to the core weakness of transmitting data in cleartext.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n\n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe311 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves a lack of secure communication (HTTPS) leading to the transmission of sensitive information in cleartext.\n  - **Root Cause:** Use of HTTP instead of HTTPS.\n  - **Weakness:** Cleartext transmission of sensitive information.\n  - **Impact:** Potential for eavesdropping and tampering.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The Cobbler server uses HTTP protocol for many of its entry points instead of HTTPS, leading to **unencrypted communication**. This directly corresponds to **CWE-319 [Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information]**, which describes the transmission of sensitive data in cleartext over a communication channel that can be sniffed. The CVE description also explicitly mentions the risk of eavesdropping and tampering, which aligns with the security implications of CWE-319.\n\nThe choice of CWE-319 is further supported by its Base abstraction level and Allowed Usage, as per the CWE specifications. This level of specificity accurately captures the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but ultimately deemed less suitable:\n*   CWE-757 (Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation): While algorithm negotiation could be a factor in some cases, the primary issue here is the complete absence of encryption, not the selection of a weaker algorithm.\n*   CWE-784 (Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision): This is specific to cookie handling, which is not the core issue in this vulnerability.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-319 is based on the direct match between the vulnerability description and the CWE's characteristics, the appropriate abstraction level, and the MITRE mapping guidance.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion. If the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
