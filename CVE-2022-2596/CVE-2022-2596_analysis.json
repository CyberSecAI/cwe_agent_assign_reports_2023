The vulnerability is caused by an inefficient regular expression, which directly aligns with CWE-1333. While CWE-407 is a parent, it is a more general description of inefficient algorithmic complexity. CWE-625 describes a regular expression that is too permissive, which could lead to issues but isn't the core problem here; the core problem is the inefficiency of the regex itself.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    cwe625[\"CWE-625: Permissive Regular Expression\"]\n\n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe407,cwe625 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **inefficient regular expression complexity** (CWE-1333), which leads to excessive CPU consumption and ultimately results in a denial-of-service vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-1333 as the primary candidate due to the explicit mention of **\"Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"** in both the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The **rootcause** is the inefficient regular expression.\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"The vulnerability is caused by a regular expression (regex) used to validate the host component of a URL in the `isOriginPotentiallyTrustworthy` function. The regex `^(.+\\.)\\*localhost$` is susceptible to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attacks.\" This evidence strongly supports CWE-1333.\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-1333 is a specific type of CWE-407, and choosing the more specific CWE-1333 is the correct decision.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the **rootcause** of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
