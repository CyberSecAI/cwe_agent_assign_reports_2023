## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the selection was the hierarchical relationship between CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and its child CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) and CWE-620 (Unverified Password Change). Although CWE-287 is discouraged, the description of the vulnerability closely aligns with its general concept of failing to properly prove a claimed identity. CWE-620 is also relevant because the vulnerability allows password changes without proper verification of the user's identity. CWE-290 (Authentication Bypass by Spoofing) was also considered, as the vulnerability allows users to obtain tickets for services they are not authorized to use, effectively spoofing their identity. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was considered because the KDC incorrectly authorizes access to services based on improperly issued tickets.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **misconfiguration** of the KDC and kpasswd service sharing a single account and set of keys. This leads to **improper authentication** (CWE-287) and the ability to obtain unauthorized tickets, potentially resulting in **authentication bypass** (CWE-290) and **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863), ultimately leading to **elevation of privilege** and **account control**.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified CWE-287 as the primary weakness due to the **improper authentication** mechanism allowing unauthorized access. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" clearly states that the KDC "incorrectly accepted kpasswd tickets as if they were TGTs," which directly violates proper authentication procedures. While CWE-287 is discouraged, the evidence strongly supports its relevance, making it the most appropriate high-level classification.

The analysis also considered CWE-620 because the vulnerability allows users with expired passwords to obtain tickets, essentially changing their access without proper verification. This aligns with the "Unverified Password Change" concept.

CWE-290 was considered due to the bypass of authentication via spoofing. The ability to obtain TGTs or service tickets meant for other services allows a user to effectively spoof their identity and gain unauthorized access.

CWE-863 was considered because the KDC performs an authorization check, but does so incorrectly, allowing unauthorized access.

The final selection prioritizes CWE-287 as the central authentication failure, with CWE-620, CWE-290, and CWE-863 representing contributing factors or consequences of the initial authentication flaw. The confidence level is high due to the clear articulation of the authentication failure in the vulnerability description and supporting evidence.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-2031

## Vulnerability Description
A flaw was found in Samba. The security vulnerability occurs when KDC and the kpasswd service share a single account and set of keys, allowing them to decrypt each others tickets. A user who has been requested to change their password, can exploit this flaw to obtain and use tickets to other services.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** decrypt each other's tickets
- **product:** Samba

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-2031:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause lies in the fact that the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) and the kpasswd (password change) service in Samba share a single account and set of keys. This allows them to decrypt each other's tickets, leading to vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **TGTs from kpasswd requests:** When a user's password has expired, they should only be able to obtain tickets for the kpasswd service. However, due to a misconfiguration when canonicalizing the kpasswd principal to that of the TGS (Ticket Granting Service) when built with Heimdal Kerberos, the user could obtain TGTs (Ticket Granting Tickets) from ordinary kpasswd requests, even though their password should be expired and they should be restricted to kpasswd requests.
2. **Accepting kpasswd tickets as TGTs:** In Samba versions below 4.16 and in Samba builds using MIT Kerberos, the KDC incorrectly accepted kpasswd tickets as if they were TGTs. This enabled users with expired passwords to obtain tickets to services other than the password change service.
3.  **Accepting TGTs as kpasswd tickets:** Password changes could be initiated by presenting TGTs as if they were kpasswd tickets. TGTs typically have longer lifetimes than kpasswd tickets, so a stolen TGT could be used to indefinitely control an account via password change.
4.  **Accepting kpasswd tickets for self-password changes:** The kpasswd service incorrectly accepted kpasswd tickets for self password changes, where it should only accept tickets acquired directly from the KDC.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** By obtaining TGTs (Ticket Granting Tickets) or service tickets meant for other services, a user with an expired password or the ability to forge tickets could access services they were not authorized to use, thus achieving an elevation of privilege.
*   **Account Control:** By using TGTs as kpasswd tickets, an attacker can change a user's password, potentially gaining indefinite control of an account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network access:** An attacker needs network access to communicate with the Samba server.
*   **Expired Password:**  An attacker can exploit this vulnerability after a user's password has expired to obtain tickets not meant for them
*   **Stolen TGT:** An attacker who has stolen a valid TGT can use it to change a user's password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Samba server.
*   **Valid Domain User:** The attacker must have an account on the domain managed by the vulnerable samba server, even if their password is expired or if they only have stolen a TGT of a valid user
*   **Ability to send kerberos requests:**  The attacker needs to be able to send kerberos requests to the vulnerable samba server.

**Additional Details**

*  The issue affects all versions of Samba prior to 4.16.4.
*  The vulnerability was present in Samba built with both Heimdal and MIT Kerberos implementations
*  The fix involves restricting the lifetime of kpasswd tickets to a maximum of two minutes and not accepting TGTs with less than two minutes left to live to avoid accepting kpasswd tickets.
*  The kpasswd service can be disabled as a workaround in some environments by setting `kpasswd port = 0` in the smb.conf.
* CVSS Score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N (5.4)

### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The main difference between the use of hard-coded passwords and the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys is the false sense of security that the former conveys. Many people believe that simply hashing a hard-coded password before storage will protect the information from malicious users. However, many hashes are reversible (or at least vulnerable to brute force attacks) -- and further, many authentication protocols simply request the hash itself, making it no better than a password.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29960:** Engineering Workstation uses hard-coded cryptographic keys that could allow for unathorized filesystem access and privilege escalation
- **CVE-2022-30271:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used by default.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-620: Unverified Password Change
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When setting a new password for a user, the product does not require knowledge of the original password, or using another form of authentication.

### Extended Description
This could be used by an attacker to change passwords for another user, thus gaining the privileges associated with that user.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1390

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2007-0681:** Web app allows remote attackers to change the passwords of arbitrary users without providing the original password, and possibly perform other unauthorized actions.
- **CVE-2000-0944:** Web application password change utility doesn't check the original password.




## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
According to WASC, "Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization."

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-672
ChildOf -> CWE-672
CanPrecede -> CWE-287

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.






## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.

### Extended Description


Cryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.


It is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.


Since the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered "unsafe" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.


For a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30273:** SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity
- **CVE-2022-30320:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.
- **CVE-2008-3775:** Product uses "ROT-25" to obfuscate the password in the registry.




## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description


Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.


When access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.


### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information
- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.
- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.




## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.

### Extended Description
When a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-285
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which "permissions" are not checked, which is an "authorization" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].
**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.
- **CVE-2009-3482:** Anti-virus product sets insecure "Everyone: Full Control" permissions for files under the "Program Files" folder, allowing attackers to replace executables with Trojan horses.
- **CVE-2009-3897:** Product creates directories with 0777 permissions at installation, allowing users to gain privileges and access a socket used for authentication.
