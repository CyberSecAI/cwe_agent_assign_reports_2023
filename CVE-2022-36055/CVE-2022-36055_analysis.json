CWE-789 is a variant of CWE-770, indicating a more specific type of resource allocation issue. The vulnerability involves allocating memory based on an untrusted size, fitting the description of CWE-789. CWE-770 is a broader category that applies because the allocation occurs without limits or throttling.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe789 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with malicious input leading to excessive memory allocation, ultimately causing a denial-of-service condition due to an out-of-memory panic. The root cause is the **improper handling of user-supplied strings**, resulting in the creation of large array data structures. This can be described as:\n\n1.  **Malicious Input:** User-supplied strings via `--set`, `--set-string`, etc.\n2.  **Improper Memory Allocation (CWE-789):** The `strvals` package allocates memory based on the size derived from the malicious input without proper validation.\n3.  **Resource Exhaustion (CWE-770):**  Memory is exhausted due to the excessive allocations.\n4.  **Denial of Service:** The application panics due to the out-of-memory condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability description indicates an **out of memory panic** caused by specific string inputs. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the **root cause** is the `strvals` package's **improper handling of user-supplied strings**, leading to the creation of large array data structures.\n\nThe Retriever Results highlight CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) as the top candidate, aligning well with the vulnerability's nature. CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is also a strong candidate.\n\nThe relationship between CWE-789 and CWE-770 is crucial. CWE-789 is a variant of CWE-770, indicating a more specific type of resource allocation issue. Given that the vulnerability involves allocating memory based on an untrusted size, CWE-789 is a more precise classification of the **root cause** while CWE-770 is a broader characterization.\n\nTherefore, CWE-789 is chosen as the primary CWE because it directly reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability. CWE-770 is selected as a secondary CWE to further describe the general weakness of allocating resources without proper limits. Both CWEs are at appropriate levels of abstraction (Variant and Base, respectively).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place, consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
