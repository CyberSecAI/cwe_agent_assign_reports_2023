While **CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer)** is a parent, **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)** is more specific and directly reflects the stated **rootcause** of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)** - The software writes data outside the intended buffer.\n2.  **Impact:** Heap corruption - The out-of-bounds write corrupts the heap memory.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly supports classifying this vulnerability as **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)**. The vulnerability description explicitly states \"Out of bounds write\", and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this as the **root cause**. The retriever results also list **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)** with a high score.\n\nThe decision is based on the direct evidence: \"**Root cause of vulnerability**: **Out of bounds write**\" from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary and \"**rootcause**: **out of bounds write**\" from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\".\n\nWhile other CWEs like **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)** and **CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'))** appear in the \"Top CWEs\" and \"Retriever Results\", they do not accurately describe the **root cause** of this vulnerability. The primary weakness is a write operation outside the buffer's boundaries, making **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)** the most specific and appropriate classification.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the **root cause** described in the vulnerability description and reference links.",
