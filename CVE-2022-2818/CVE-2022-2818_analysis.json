  "analysis": "# Summary\n| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| CWE-212 | Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer | 1.00 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |\n| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-212, which focuses on the failure to remove sensitive information before storage or transfer. CWE-201 represents a potential follow-on weakness where the sensitive information is then inserted into sent data. The relationship between these two CWEs is that CWE-212 can precede CWE-201. Both CWE-212 and CWE-201 are Base level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n\n    cwe212 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe201\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe212 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of weaknesses starts with the **improper removal of sensitive information** (the 2FA secret) which leads to its inclusion in the JWT, resulting in the exposure of that sensitive information during transfer.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly suggests CWE-212 as the primary weakness, as the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**improper removal of sensitive information**\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the root cause lies in the inclusion of the user's 2FA secret within the JWT, indicating a failure to remove this sensitive data before creating the token.\nCWE-201 is considered as a secondary candidate because after the sensitive information was not removed, it was then inserted into the JWT.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer) is chosen as the primary CWE because the vulnerability lies in the **failure to remove the 2FA secret before including it in the JWT**. This aligns directly with CWE-212's description: \"The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\"\n\nCWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) is considered as a secondary CWE, because the 2FA secret was included in the JWT. This aligns with CWE-201's description: \"The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\"\n\nCWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) was considered but not chosen because it is a high-level Class CWE and the mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available. The issue is not merely exposing a resource to the wrong sphere, but the specific act of failing to remove sensitive data before storage/transfer.",
