# Analysis for CVE-2022-35651

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-918 | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]**, which occurs due to **insufficient sanitization**. This can **precede** other weaknesses. **CWE-918 [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)]** is a secondary weakness that could also stem from **insufficient sanitization**. Both CWEs are at the Base level, offering appropriate specificity.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient sanitization** of user-supplied data. This leads to:
1.  **CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]**: A remote attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and script code.
2.  **CWE-918 [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)]**: The application may make unintended requests to other servers.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions **insufficient sanitization** as the root cause, leading to both stored XSS and blind SSRF.

The description states: "A stored XSS and blind SSRF vulnerability was found in Moodle, occurs due to **insufficient sanitization** of user-supplied data in the SCORM track details. A remote attacker can trick the victim to follow a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in users browser in context of vulnerable website to steal potentially sensitive information, change appearance of the web page, can perform phishing and drive-by-download attacks."

**CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]** is selected as the primary CWE because the description explicitly mentions the execution of arbitrary HTML and script code within the user's browser, which is the core characteristic of XSS.

**CWE-918 [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)]** is included as a secondary CWE because the description also mentions a blind SSRF vulnerability. This suggests that the application is making requests to other servers based on user-supplied data, without proper validation.

The relationship graph influenced the decision by highlighting the possible relationships between the different CWEs, particularly how **CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]** can **precede** other weaknesses.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause and the resulting vulnerabilities described in the vulnerability description.

Other CWEs considered but not used:

*   **CWE-138 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements]**: While this is a broader category that includes both XSS and SSRF, **CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]** and **CWE-918 [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)]** are more specific and therefore more appropriate.
*   **CWE-80 [Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)]**: This is a variant of XSS, but **CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]** is preferred as it covers a broader range of XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **CWE-116 [Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output]**: While related to neutralization, the core issue is the lack of sanitization of input, making **CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]** and **CWE-918 [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)]** more relevant.
