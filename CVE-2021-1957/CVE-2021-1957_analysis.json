CWE-413 is a Base level vulnerability and child of CWE-667.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe413[\"CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking\"]\n\n    cwe413 -->|CHILDOF| cwe667\n    cwe667 -->|ParentOf| cwe413\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves an **improper access control** issue due to a failure in ACL link encryption and the link not being disconnected during reconnection. This leads to **improper privilege management**, where a device might gain unauthorized access because of the failed encryption and lack of disconnection. **Improper Resource Locking** during the reconnection attempt might further exacerbate the issue.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **Improper Access Control** due to failure in ACL link encryption and the failure to disconnect during reconnection with a paired device.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"**Improper Access Control when ACL link encryption is failed and ACL link is not disconnected during reconnection with paired device**\". This indicates that the system **fails to properly manage access rights** when the ACL link encryption fails and does not disconnect, leading to potential unauthorized access.\n\nGiven the **improper access control** and the context of managing privileges during reconnection, CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management) is deemed the most suitable primary CWE.\n\nCWE-413 (Improper Resource Locking) might also be relevant if the reconnection process involves locking resources, but the provided description focuses more on access control issues.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-269 providing a broad categorization of the privilege management issue and CWE-413 highlighting a potential resource locking problem.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\n\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n\n**Description**: The software does not properly manage privileges or permissions for sensitive resources.\n\n**Rationale**: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Mapping Guidance**: Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n\n## CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking\n\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n\n**Description**: The product does not lock or does not correctly lock a resource when the product must have exclusive access to the resource.\n\n**Rationale**: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**: Usage: Allowed",
