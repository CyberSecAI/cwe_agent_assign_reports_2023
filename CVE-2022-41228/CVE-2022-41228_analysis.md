# Analysis for CVE-2022-41228

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 1.0 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | 0.5 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the decision is that CWE-862 (**Missing Authorization**) is a child of CWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**). While the description uses the term "**missing permission check**" directly indicating a **missing authorization**, the class-level CWE-862 is a more appropriate fit than the discouraged CWE-285. CWE-522 (**Insufficiently Protected Credentials**) is considered as a secondary candidate as the vulnerability allows connecting to a webserver using attacker-specified credentials.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission check** (CWE-862), which allows attackers to connect to an attacker-specified webserver using attacker-specified credentials.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified the **missing permission check** as the root cause, pointing towards an authorization issue. The retriever results strongly suggested CWE-862 (**Missing Authorization**) as a primary candidate. The CVE reference confirms that the root cause of the vulnerability is indeed a **missing permission check** in a form validation method.

The evidence supporting CWE-862 is strong. The vulnerability description states: "A **missing permission check** in Jenkins NS-ND Integration Performance Publisher Plugin 4.8.0.129 and earlier allows attackers with Overall/Read permissions to connect to an attacker-specified webserver using attacker-specified credentials." Also, the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section states: "The NS-ND Integration Performance Publisher Plugin does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation."

CWE-862 is at the Class level, and while the description also mentions the ability to "connect to an attacker-specified webserver using attacker-specified credentials", this is more of an impact of the **missing permission check** rather than a separate root cause. Thus, a single CWE is sufficient to describe the core vulnerability. CWE-522 (**Insufficiently Protected Credentials**) is also considered because the attacker can specify the credentials to use, this is a secondary consideration.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.81
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. This is often a component in phishing attacks.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 4865.68
