This indicates a hierarchical relationship where CWE-321 is a more specific case of CWE-798. The vulnerability involves a hardcoded cryptographic key, so choosing the more specific CWE-321 is appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe321 primary\n    class cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **hardcoded DES key** (CWE-321), which allows an attacker to **decrypt encrypted LDAP bind credentials.**\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **hardcoded DES key** as the root cause. The description explicitly mentions this key in the `LDAPDesPWEncrypter` class, which is used to encrypt LDAP bind credentials. The primary CWE selected is CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key), as it is the most specific CWE that accurately describes the vulnerability.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision is the **rootcause** phrase \"**hardcoded DES key in the LDAPDesPWEncrypter class**\".\n\nCWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) was considered as a broader category, but CWE-321 is more specific and therefore more appropriate. Other CWEs like CWE-1240 (Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation) and CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) were considered but deemed less relevant because the core issue is the hardcoded key, not necessarily the weakness of the cryptographic primitive itself, although the DES algorithm is considered weak.\n\nThe selection of CWE-321 aligns with MITRE's mapping guidance, as it is a Variant-level CWE and the evidence supports this level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
