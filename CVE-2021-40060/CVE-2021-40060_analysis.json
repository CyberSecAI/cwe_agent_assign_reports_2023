CWE-122, a **heap-based buffer overflow**, is a variant of CWE-787, further specifying the location of the overflow. CWE-119 is a more general class that encompasses various memory boundary errors, including out-of-bounds reads and writes. The relationship is hierarchical: CWE-787 is a specific type of CWE-119, and CWE-122 is a specific type of CWE-787, indicating the memory allocation type. The abstraction levels influenced the decision to select the most specific CWE-787 as primary.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe122 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves a **heap-based buffer overflow** (root cause) leading to a potential impact on availability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified a **heap-based buffer overflow** vulnerability in the video framework, potentially affecting availability. The primary CWE match suggested was CWE-NVD-noinfo, which is not specific enough. The top CWEs included CWE-787 and CWE-20, suggesting further investigation. The retriever results also highlighted CWE-119, CWE-190, and CWE-122.\n\nBased on the evidence, CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is the most appropriate primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"heap-based buffer overflow,\" indicating a write operation (**heap-based buffer overflow**) outside the intended buffer boundaries. This aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-787.\n\nCWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is a valid secondary consideration as it specifies the location of the buffer overflow (heap).\n\nCWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is a more general category and, while applicable, is less specific than CWE-787 and thus less ideal as the primary mapping.\n\nThe selection is based on the provided evidence: \"There is a **heap-based buffer overflow** vulnerability in the video framework.\" This directly supports CWE-787 as the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-787 representing the root cause and CWE-122 providing additional context about the memory allocation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**:

integer overflow can occur that causes less memory to be allocated than expected, leading to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a named chain, which combines multiple weaknesses.\n\n*Not selected:* While an integer overflow could potentially lead to a buffer overflow, it is not explicitly mentioned in the description. The description focuses solely on the buffer overflow itself.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected:* This CWE is about out-of-bounds read, while the vulnerability is a buffer overflow (write",
