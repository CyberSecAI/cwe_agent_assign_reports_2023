While the vulnerability description indicates **improper locking**, leading to **memory corruption**, the description doesn't specify the precise nature of the locking issue. The retriever results also list CWE-787 which is more related to the **memory corruption** aspect.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe662[\"CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\"]\n    cwe413[\"CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe667 -->|CHILDOF| cwe662\n    cwe413 -->|CHILDOF| cwe667\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe667 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n    class cwe662,cwe413,cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with **improper locking** (CWE-667), which leads to **memory corruption**. The memory corruption could manifest as an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787), ultimately resulting in a local denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-667 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of \"**improper locking**\" in the vulnerability description. However, the resulting \"**memory corruption**\" suggests that the improper locking led to a memory safety issue.\n\nThe evidence is somewhat limited because the CVE Reference Links Content Summary does not provide information about the vulnerability. The assessment is based on the vulnerability description and key phrases. The graph relationships influenced the decision to include CWE-787 as a potential secondary weakness related to the observed memory corruption, acknowledging the potential for an out-of-bounds write scenario.\n\nCWE-667 is chosen as the primary CWE because the root cause is **improper locking**. This aligns with the vulnerability description key phrases. The abstraction level is Class, which is higher than Base or Variant, but since the description doesn't provide specific information, it is an appropriate choice.\n\nCWE-787 is included as a secondary candidate because the **memory corruption** mentioned could be the result of an out-of-bounds write.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
