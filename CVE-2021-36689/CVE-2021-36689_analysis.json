This is related to the broader category of weak authentication (CWE-1390), as a rate limit is one mechanism to strengthen authentication. The secondary weaknesses are the weak PIN complexity requirements (CWE-521) and the insufficient computational effort in the password hash (CWE-916), both of which make brute-force attacks easier. CWE-521 is a child of CWE-1391, indicating a specific type of weak credential usage. CWE-916 relates to the password hashing scheme used.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe307[\"CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts\"]\n    cwe521[\"CWE-521: Weak Password Requirements\"]\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n\n    cwe307 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe521 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1391\n    cwe1391 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe307 primary\n    class cwe521,cwe916 secondary\n    class cwe1390,cwe1391,cwe327 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of rate limiting (CWE-307)** and **weak password requirements (CWE-521)** combined with **insufficient computational effort for the PIN hash (CWE-916)**. This allows an attacker with access to the device storage to brute-force the PIN, leading to decryption of the wallet and control over the user's Bitcoin funds.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered the retriever results, which suggested several potential CWEs. The primary CWE, based on the evidence, is CWE-307, as the vulnerability description and CVE details highlight the **lack of rate limiting** as a key factor enabling the brute-force attack. The **weak PIN requirements (CWE-521)** and **insufficient PBKDF2 iterations (CWE-916)** are contributing factors to the feasibility of the brute-force attack, making them secondary weaknesses.\n\nThe evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary supports these choices: \"The PIN authentication mechanism in the Samourai Wallet application is **weak due to a lack of proper rate limiting**\" and \"Insufficient PBKDF2 iterations (15,000) for key derivation. This makes it feasible to brute-force the PIN.\"\n\nThe relationship graph reinforces the understanding that these weaknesses are related to authentication and cryptographic practices. The chosen CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, providing sufficient specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product violates well-established principles for secure design.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
