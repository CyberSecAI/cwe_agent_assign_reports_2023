## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound), which is a base-level CWE. It relates to CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation), a class-level CWE, as a child. It can precede CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is a child of CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) and can precede CWE-789 (Uncontrolled Memory Allocation). The choice of CWE-190 as the primary CWE is based on the evidence of an integer overflow leading to a denial of service, and it is a base-level CWE which is preferred. CWE-1284 is added as the input was not validated.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of validation** of the input `block_shape` (CWE-1284), which leads to an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) when calculating the output tensor's size. This overflow results in an assertion failure, causing a denial of service.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis indicates that the primary weakness is an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) in the `tf.raw_ops.SpaceToBatchND` implementation, triggered by a **lack of validation** of the input `block_shape` (CWE-1284). The root cause is the integer overflow, which leads to a denial-of-service due to an assertion failure. The evidence from the CVE description and the reference links content summary confirms this.

The selection of CWE-190 is based on the clear evidence of an integer overflow when calculating the output tensor's size: "The vulnerability stems from an **integer overflow** in the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.SpaceToBatchND`."

CWE-1284 is added as the input was not validated: "The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties." and "The attacker needs to be able to control the inputs to the `tf.raw_ops.SpaceToBatchND` operation, specifically the `block_shape` parameter. This could be achieved by providing manipulated data to a TensorFlow model that uses this operation."

CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) were considered due to the potential memory corruption issues that can arise from integer overflows, but they were deemed less relevant because the immediate impact is a denial-of-service via an assertion failure, not necessarily memory corruption in this specific case.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity as they accurately describe the root cause (integer overflow) and the contributing factor (lack of input validation) of the vulnerability.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-29203

## Vulnerability Description
TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.SpaceToBatchND` (in all backends such as XLA and handwritten kernels) is vulnerable to an **integer overflow** The result of this **integer overflow** is used to allocate the output tensor, hence we get a denial of service via a `CHECK`-failure (assertion failure), as in TFSA-2021-198. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **integer overflow**
- **impact:** Denial of Service
- **vector:** assertion failure
- **product:** TensorFlow
- **version:** prior to 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4
- **component:** tf.raw_ops.SpaceToBatchND

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-29203:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.SpaceToBatchND`. This overflow occurs when calculating the output tensor's size.

**Weaknesses:**

- Integer Overflow: The code multiplies dimensions of the input tensor with the block shape without proper checks to prevent overflows. If the result is a negative number, a `CHECK`-failure (assertion failure) occurs, leading to a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Denial of Service (DoS): Exploiting this vulnerability can cause a denial of service due to the assertion failure (CHECK-failure), which crashes the application. The process is terminated unexpectedly.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Malicious Input: An attacker can craft specific input tensors and `block_shape` parameters to `tf.raw_ops.SpaceToBatchND` that will cause an integer overflow when calculating the output tensor's dimensions, leading to the crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to control the inputs to the `tf.raw_ops.SpaceToBatchND` operation, specifically the `block_shape` parameter. This could be achieved by providing manipulated data to a TensorFlow model that uses this operation.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is located in the `SpaceToBatchND` operation which is used to rearrange data within a tensor. The output shape is calculated based on input shape, block shape, and paddings.
- Integer overflows happen in the calculation of `block_num_elems` and `output_dim`.
- The fix involves adding checks that ensure block dimensions are positive and that intermediate and output dimensions are positive after multiplication, preventing the overflow and subsequent crash.

**Patches:**

- The vulnerability is fixed in TensorFlow versions 2.6.4, 2.7.2, 2.8.1, and 2.9.0. The fix is also present in commit `acd56b8bcb72b163c834ae4f18469047b001fadf`.
- The patch adds checks to ensure the product of the block dimensions is positive and the output dimension is non-negative. This prevents the integer overflow that leads to the crash.
- Shape inference was also updated with `MultiplyWithoutOverflow` function to avoid integer overflow.

This information is more detailed than the official CVE description.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Overflow: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
Wraparound: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
wrap, wrap-around, wrap around: Alternate spellings of "wraparound"

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-20
CanPrecede -> CWE-119

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with "overflow," "underflow," and "wraparound" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called "underflows").


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.

**[Terminology]** 

"Integer overflow" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.


A "wraparound" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.


"Overflow" is sometimes conflated with "wraparound" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.


The "overflow" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use "overflow" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using "underflow" for exceeding the minimum.


Some people use "overflow" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses "underflow" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.


See [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.


**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.




## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.

- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).




## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

### Extended Description


If the pointer contains an uninitialized value, then the value might not point to a valid memory location. This could cause the product to read from or write to unexpected memory locations, leading to a denial of service. If the uninitialized pointer is used as a function call, then arbitrary functions could be invoked. If an attacker can influence the portion of uninitialized memory that is contained in the pointer, this weakness could be leveraged to execute code or perform other attacks.


Depending on memory layout, associated memory management behaviors, and product operation, the attacker might be able to influence the contents of the uninitialized pointer, thus gaining more fine-grained control of the memory location to be accessed.


### Alternative Terms
None

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.

**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of "memory corruption" or "memory safety." As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-32878:** LLM product has a free of an uninitialized pointer
- **CVE-2010-0211:** chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) leads to free of invalid, uninitialized pointer (CWE-824).
- **CVE-2009-2768:** Pointer in structure is not initialized, leading to NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) and system crash.




## CWE-1287: Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to be of a certain type, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually of the expected type.

### Extended Description


When input does not comply with the expected type, attackers could trigger unexpected errors, cause incorrect actions to take place, or exploit latent vulnerabilities that would not be possible if the input conformed with the expected type.


This weakness can appear in type-unsafe programming languages, or in programming languages that support casting or conversion of an input to another type.

- **CVE-2021-28664:** GPU kernel driver allows memory corruption because a user can obtain read/write access to read-only pages, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.

### Extended Description


While assertion is good for catching logic errors and reducing the chances of reaching more serious vulnerability conditions, it can still lead to a denial of service.


For example, if a server handles multiple simultaneous connections, and an assert() occurs in one single connection that causes all other connections to be dropped, this is a reachable assertion that leads to a denial of service.
