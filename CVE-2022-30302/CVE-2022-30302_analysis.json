CWE-23 is a child of CWE-22 \"Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\", indicating a more general form of path traversal. CWE-73 \"External Control of File Name or Path\" can precede CWE-23, meaning that external control of the file path can lead to relative path traversal.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe23[\"CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    \n    cwe23 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe23\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe23 primary\n    class cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with external control over the file path (CWE-73), which then leads to a relative path traversal vulnerability (CWE-23). The impact of this is the ability to retrieve and delete arbitrary files.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, especially the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" which explicitly mentions \"**relative path traversal vulnerabilities [CWE-23]**\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also confirms the presence of \"**Path traversal vulnerability [CWE-23]**\".\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-23 is the most specific and relevant CWE, with CWE-73 as a contributing factor (external control of the path).\nCWE-23 is selected as the primary CWE because it accurately represents the weakness described in the vulnerability description. The provided evidence is clear and direct, supporting the selection of CWE-23 with high confidence. CWE-73 is a secondary CWE to indicate that the path is externally controlled.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
