The vulnerability involves a missing custom error page (CWE-756), potentially leading to the generation of error messages containing sensitive information (CWE-209), such as stack traces, which could aid attackers.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe756[\"CWE-756: Missing Custom Error Page\"]\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe756 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe209\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe756 primary\n    class cwe209 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing custom error page** (CWE-756). This **root cause** leads to the potential for the application to generate error messages that contain sensitive information (CWE-209), such as stack traces, revealing internal workings of the application. This information can then be used by an attacker to gain further insights for exploitation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, particularly the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The description highlights the **improper redirect** due to the **missing custom error page**. The CVE reference specifies that the default error page might leak stack trace information.\n\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-756 (Missing Custom Error Page), as the **root cause** is precisely the absence of a custom error page. This aligns directly with the CWE description and the \"Top Combined Results\" from the retriever results. The confidence level is high (0.9) due to the explicit mention of the missing error page.\n\nCWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information) was considered as a secondary CWE, as the missing custom error page could lead to the exposure of sensitive information through default error messages, including stack traces. The confidence level is lower (0.5) because the description focuses on the missing error page itself rather than explicitly stating that sensitive information is being exposed, though that is a likely consequence.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-756 is a base CWE and directly addresses the missing error page. A more generic CWE like CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) would be less specific.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available.
