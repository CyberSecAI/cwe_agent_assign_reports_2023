This overflow leads to an **out-of-bounds read** (**CWE-125**). The root cause is the integer overflow, and the out-of-bounds read is the direct consequence that leads to information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that an **integer overflow** leads to an **out-of-bounds read**: \"In valid_ipc_dram_addr of cm_access_control.c, there is a possible **out of bounds read** due to an **integer overflow**.\" The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section confirms the **integer overflow** as the **root cause** and the **out of bounds read** as the **weakness**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary mentions \"Information Disclosure\" as the impact of the vulnerability.\n\nThe retriever results list **CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound)** with the highest score. **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)** is also listed.\n\nThe relationship graph shows how **CWE-190** can precede **CWE-125**. The description for **CWE-190** notes: \"Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.\" This aligns with the vulnerability description.\n\nI considered **CWE-191 (Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound))**, but the vulnerability description specifically mentions an \"integer overflow,\" making **CWE-190** the more accurate choice.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly represent the root cause (**CWE-190**) and the immediate consequence (**CWE-125**) of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or
