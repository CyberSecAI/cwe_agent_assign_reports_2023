# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-328 | Use of Weak Hash | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-836 | Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash), is a direct representation of the **root cause** described in the vulnerability. CWE-836 (Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication) and CWE-294 (Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay) are related, as the **weak hash** allows an attacker to replay a captured hash to bypass authentication. These are listed as secondary.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events is as follows:
1.  **Root Cause:** The system uses a **weak hash** (CWE-328) algorithm for password storage.
2.  An attacker eavesdrops on network traffic and captures the password hash.
3.  The attacker reverses the captured hash.
4.  The attacker uses the reversed password to log in, bypassing authentication (CWE-294).

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is heavily based on the provided evidence, which explicitly mentions the "**Use of Weak Hash**" as the root cause and provides supporting details.

The vulnerability description states: "Use of Weak Hash vulnerability in Mitsubishi Electric MELSEC...allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to login to the product by using a password reversed from a previously eavesdropped password hash." The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" also confirms the root cause: "**Root cause of vulnerability:** Use of a weak hash algorithm for password storage."

CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash) is the most appropriate because it directly addresses the core issue: the use of an insecure hashing algorithm. The other considered CWEs, such as CWE-836 (Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication) and CWE-294 (Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay), represent potential consequences or related aspects of the **weak hash**, but CWE-328 is the fundamental flaw.

CWE-328 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) as it directly describes the technical weakness.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-316: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext in memory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 7837.38
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash
