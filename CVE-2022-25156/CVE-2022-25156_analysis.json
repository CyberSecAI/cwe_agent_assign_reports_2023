CWE-836 (Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication) and CWE-294 (Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay) are related, as the **weak hash** allows an attacker to replay a captured hash to bypass authentication. These are listed as secondary.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n    cwe836[\"CWE-836: Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication\"]\n    cwe294[\"CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\"]\n    cwe326[\"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\"]\n\n    cwe328 -->|CHILDOF| cwe326\n    cwe836 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe294 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe328 primary\n    class cwe836,cwe294,cwe326 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** The system uses a **weak hash** (CWE-328) algorithm for password storage.\n2.  An attacker eavesdrops on network traffic and captures the password hash.\n3.  The attacker reverses the captured hash.\n4.  The attacker uses the reversed password to log in, bypassing authentication (CWE-294).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is heavily based on the provided evidence, which explicitly mentions the \"**Use of Weak Hash**\" as the root cause and provides supporting details.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"Use of Weak Hash vulnerability in Mitsubishi Electric MELSEC...allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to login to the product by using a password reversed from a previously eavesdropped password hash.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also confirms the root cause: \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** Use of a weak hash algorithm for password storage.\"\n\nCWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash) is the most appropriate because it directly addresses the core issue: the use of an insecure hashing algorithm. The other considered CWEs, such as CWE-836 (Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication) and CWE-294 (Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay), represent potential consequences or related aspects of the **weak hash**, but CWE-328 is the fundamental flaw.\n\nCWE-328 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) as it directly describes the technical weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE
