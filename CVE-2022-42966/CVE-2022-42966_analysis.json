This indicates a hierarchical relationship where CWE-1333 is a specific type of CWE-407.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe407 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an inefficient regular expression (CWE-1333). This inefficiency leads to excessive CPU consumption, ultimately resulting in a denial of service (DoS).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates an exponential ReDoS (**regular expression denial of service**) vulnerability in the `cleo` PyPI package's `Table.set_rows` method. The root cause is an inefficient regular expression that consumes excessive CPU cycles when processing crafted input.\n\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity). This selection is based on the following evidence:\n\n*   The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**regular expression denial of service**\".\n*   The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the **root cause** is an exponential ReDoS.\n*   CWE-1333's description aligns perfectly with the vulnerability: \"The product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.\"\n*   The \"Alternative Terms\" section of CWE-1333 lists \"ReDoS\" and \"Regular Expression Denial of Service\" which is the **weakness** described.\n*   CWE-1333 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n*   The Mapping Guidance for CWE-1333 states \"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\"\n*   The retriever results listed CWE-1333 as the highest ranked CWE with a score of 1.0.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-407 (Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity): While this is a parent of CWE-1333, it's more general. The vulnerability is specifically related to a regular expression, making CWE-1333 a more precise fit.\n*   CWE-617 (Reachable Assertion): This CWE relates to assertion failures that can be triggered by an attacker. While a denial of service could result from an assertion failure, the root cause here is the inefficient regular expression, not an assertion.\n*   CWE-185 (Incorrect Regular Expression): This CWE relates to regular expressions that are incorrectly written, leading to improper matching. While the regular expression is inefficient, the primary issue is its complexity, not necessarily that it's syntactically incorrect.\n*   CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')): This CWE is too high-level and doesn't directly address the ReDoS issue.\n\nThe selected CWE, CWE-1333, is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: an inefficient regular expression leading to a denial of service. The evidence strongly supports this classification, and the relationship analysis confirms that it is a specific type of algorithmic complexity issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-185: Incorrect Regular Expression\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product specifies a regular expression in a way that causes data to be improperly matched or compared.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-625: Permissive Regular Expression\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a regular expression that does not sufficiently restrict the set of allowed values.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
