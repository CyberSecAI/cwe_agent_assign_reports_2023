CWE-1287 is a more specific type of input validation issue, focusing on the type of the input, whereas CWE-20 is a general improper input validation. Since the vulnerability description specifically mentions \"missing parameter type validation\", CWE-1287 is the more appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1287[\"CWE-1287: Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe1287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1287 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events for this vulnerability is:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing parameter type validation** (CWE-1287)\n2.  **Impact:** Affect availability (Denial of Service)\n\nThe vulnerability begins with the **missing parameter type validation**, which is the root cause (CWE-1287). This leads directly to a potential denial-of-service condition if an attacker provides an input of an unexpected type.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **missing parameter type validation** in the DRM module. The provided evidence clearly points to a lack of validation, specifically regarding the *type* of the parameter.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"**Missing parameter type validation** in the DRM module.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this: \"The vulnerability stems from a missing parameter type validation within the DRM (Digital Rights Management) module.\" and \"Lack of proper parameter type validation. This can allow the system to process unexpected data types which can cause issues.\"\n\nBased on this evidence, CWE-1287 (Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input) is the most appropriate primary CWE. It aligns directly with the described weakness.\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) was considered but is less specific. While the vulnerability *is* an input validation issue, the focus is explicitly on the *type* of the input. Therefore, CWE-1287, a child of CWE-20, is a more precise classification.\n\nOther CWEs were considered from the Retriever Results, but none matched as closely as CWE-1287. For example, CWE-1286 (Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input) relates to the syntax of the input, not its type. CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) focuses on quantities like size or length, which are not mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n\nThe decision to use CWE-1287 is based on the explicit mention of \"**missing parameter type validation**\" in the vulnerability description. This evidence, combined with the hierarchical relationship between CWE-1287 and CWE-20, supports the selection of CWE-1287 as the primary CWE at the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of

Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer,
