It is related to CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) and CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Command). CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')) is a parent of CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine), which may be relevant depending on the specific template engine used. The relationship analysis helped to confirm that CWE-917 is the most specific and appropriate CWE for this vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe917[\"CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Command\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n\n    cwe917 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe917 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe917 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe77,cwe94,cwe1336 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper input sanitization**, leading to **code injection**, and ultimately resulting in remote code execution. The unsecured actuator endpoint is a contributing factor, but the root cause is the lack of proper neutralization of special elements in the input.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed to **code injection** as the primary weakness, but further analysis revealed that the root cause is the **improper neutralization** of special elements within an expression language statement. This is supported by the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section, which highlights \"**improper input sanitization**\" as the root cause and \"**code injection**\" as the weakness. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also confirms that the vulnerability is due to code injection and the lack of security on the Gateway Actuator endpoint.\n\nCWE-917 aligns well with the vulnerability description and the provided evidence. It specifically addresses the **improper neutralization** of special elements in an expression language statement, which is the root cause of the **code injection** vulnerability. The retriever results also indicate that CWE-917 is a strong candidate.\n\nCWE-94 was considered because the vulnerability leads to code execution. However, CWE-917 is more specific and accurately represents the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **improper neutralization** of special elements in an expression language statement.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause and the resulting weakness. CWE-917 is a base-level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
