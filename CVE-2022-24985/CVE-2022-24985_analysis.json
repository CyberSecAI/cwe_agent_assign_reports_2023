While CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is also related, CWE-1220 provides a more specific description of the **insufficient granularity** in the access control mechanism. CWE-305 (Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness) is considered as a secondary weakness because the vulnerability is a result of an incorrect access control implementation. The abstraction levels guided the selection, preferring the Base level CWE-1220.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1220[\"CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe305[\"CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\"]\n\n    cwe1220 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe305 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1220 primary\n    class cwe305 secondary\n    class cwe287 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  The application stores the authentication status in `$_SESSION['authenticated']`.\n2.  The application **incorrectly checks** this session variable across multiple forms.\n3.  An attacker with a valid session on one form **bypasses authentication** on other forms.\n4.  The attacker gains unauthorized access to administrative sections.\n\nHere, the root cause is the **insufficient granularity of access control** (CWE-1220), which leads to the **authentication bypass** (CWE-305).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE identified is CWE-1220 (Insufficient Granularity of Access Control). This is based on the evidence that the application's access control mechanism relies on a single session variable for authentication across all forms, leading to a bypass.\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states: \"The vulnerability arises from an incorrect access control implementation in JQueryForm.com's generated forms. Specifically, the authentication status of a user is stored in the `$_SESSION['authenticated']` variable. This variable is checked before validating credentials, allowing an attacker with a valid session on one form to bypass authentication checks on other forms hosted on the same server.\"\n\nThis clearly indicates an **insufficient granularity** in how access is controlled, because the authentication status of one form is being used to grant access to other forms without proper validation.\n\nCWE-305 (Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness) is a secondary candidate because the authentication algorithm isn't inherently flawed, but the overall mechanism can be bypassed due to the access control issue.\n\nCWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is a more general class, and CWE-1220 is more specific to the **insufficient granularity** of the access control, making it a better fit.\n\nThe retriever results also support this, listing CWE-1220 as the top combined result. The mapping guidance for CWE-1220 allows its usage, stating \"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\"\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-1220 directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability which is that the access controls lack required granularity, allowing unauthorized access to security-sensitive assets.\n```",
