The vulnerability arises due to uncontrolled recursion (CWE-674), which leads to excessive memory consumption on the stack, eventually causing the overflow.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe674[\"CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe674 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe121\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe674 secondary\n    class cwe787,cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **uncontrolled recursion** (CWE-674), which leads to the consumption of stack memory. As the recursion continues without proper limits, it results in a **stack-based buffer overflow** (CWE-121), causing the jsish interpreter to crash and leading to a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified a **stack overflow**. The evidence clearly points to a **stack overflow** due to excessive recursion. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the root cause is excessive recursion in `Jsi_NameLookup` and `jsi_ValueSubscript` functions, triggered by repeatedly calling `Array.prototype.push.call(a, 42, 43)` within the `JSEtest` function called in a loop. This leads to a crash of the jsish interpreter, causing a denial of service.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) is a child of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within Memory Buffer). CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion) can precede CWE-121.\n\nGiven the specific evidence of a stack overflow caused by uncontrolled recursion, CWE-121 is the most appropriate primary CWE. CWE-674 is a contributing factor, and therefore is added as a secondary candidate. These selections are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-121 being a Variant and CWE-674 being a Class, providing a balance between detail and abstraction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n- Not Selected: The vulnerability is a stack overflow, not an underflow.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n- Not Selected: This vulnerability does not involve integer underflow.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n- Not Selected: The issue is not related to incorrect buffer size calculation but rather to uncontrolled recursion leading to stack overflow.\n\n## CWE-680: Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n- Not Selected: This vulnerability does not involve integer overflow.\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n- Not Selected: The vulnerability isn't related to incorrect length value, but rather excessive recursion causing stack overflow.\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n- Not Selected: The vulnerability is a stack overflow, not a buffer over-read.\n\n## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n- Not Selected: The vulnerability isn't related to sequential memory allocation but rather excessive recursion causing stack overflow.\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n- Not Selected: This vulnerability does not involve off-by-one errors.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n- Not Selected: The vulnerability is a stack overflow due to uncontrolled recursion, not related to integer overflow.\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n- Not Selected: This vulnerability does not involve numeric truncation errors.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6136.48\n**Source**: sparse\n- Not Selected: This vulnerability does not involve integer overflow.\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 5734.63\n**Source**: sparse\n- Not Selected: This vulnerability does not involve off-by-one errors.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 5708.35\n**Source**: sparse\n- Not Selected: The vulnerability is a stack overflow, not an out-of-bounds read.\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 5507.86\n**Source**: sparse\n- Not Selected: The vulnerability isn't related to improper validation of quantity, but rather excessive recursion causing stack overflow.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 5505.14\n**Source**: sparse\n- Not Selected: This vulnerability does not involve integer underflow.\n\n## CWE-128: Wrap-around Error\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 5.03\n**Source**: graph\n- Not Selected: This vulnerability does not involve wrap-around errors.\n\n## CWE-170: Improper Null Termination\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 5.03\n**Source**: graph\n- Not Selected: This vulnerability does not involve improper null termination.\n\n## CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.82\n**Source**: graph\n- Not Selected: The root cause is uncontrolled recursion, not a buffer copy without checking size.
