CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). While CWE-284 is too high-level (Pillar), CWE-862 and CWE-306 are more specific and relevant to the vulnerability. CWE-306 can be seen as a specific case of CWE-862 where authentication is completely missing instead of an authorization check.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n    class cwe284,cwe285 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of weaknesses starts with the **Missing Authorization**, which leads to unauthorized access to resources or functionalities.\n  - Root Cause: **Missing Authorization** (CWE-862)\n  - Impact: Unauthorized access to resources or functionalities.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **rootcause** of **Missing Authorization**. The primary CWE match from similar CVE descriptions was CWE-862, which aligns with the provided information. The analysis of the commit diff provides additional context, indicating multiple potential security issues including authorization bypasses in several modules. Specifically, the `modules/Users/User.php` file, where the `hasSaveAccess()` method allows access if no user is logged in, strongly suggests a **Missing Authentication** issue, leading to unauthorized manipulation of user data.\n\nThe final selection is based on the vulnerability description's emphasis on **Missing Authorization** and the evidence from the commit diff that supports this. CWE-862 is selected as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the **rootcause** identified in the vulnerability description. CWE-306 is included as a secondary CWE because the commit diff shows that in some cases, the authorization bypass is due to a complete lack of authentication. The provided information from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" sections, particularly the analysis of the `modules/Users/User.php` file, supports the selection of these CWEs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions is not set, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through",
