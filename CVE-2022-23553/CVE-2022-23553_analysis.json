This is due to the use of `startsWith` for URL filtering, which only compares the beginning of the string, and does not normalize the URI.\n\n**CWE-187** is a Variant of **CWE-1023 Improper Restriction of Syntactic Structure of Input**. The vulnerability could also be viewed as a case of **CWE-807 Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision**, as the filter relies on the URL, which can be manipulated by the user. Also a form of **CWE-184 Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs** as the URL filter could be seen as an incomplete list of disallowed input.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe187[\"CWE-187: Partial String Comparison\"]\n    cwe1023[\"CWE-1023: Improper Restriction of Syntactic Structure of Input\"]\n    cwe807[\"CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\"]\n    cwe184[\"CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\"]\n\n    cwe187 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1023\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **ROOTCAUSE** of **improper input validation** due to the **weakness** of the **URL access filter bypass**, specifically using `startsWith` for URL filtering. This leads to an **access control bypass**, potentially leading to source code leaks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis focused on identifying the **ROOTCAUSE** of the vulnerability. The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** pointed to a **URL access filter bypass**. The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** revealed that the `BlacklistUrlFilter` and `WhitelistUrlFilter` used the `startsWith` method, leading to the bypass.\n\n**CWE-187 Partial String Comparison** was selected as the primary CWE because it directly reflects the **weakness** of using `startsWith` for URL filtering. This function only checks if a string starts with a specific prefix, which can be easily bypassed with path traversal sequences like `/allowed/..;/blocked`.\n\n**CWE-807 Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision** and **CWE-184 Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs** were considered as secondary CWEs. **CWE-807** is relevant because the security decision relies on the input URL, which is controlled by the user. **CWE-184** is relevant because the URL filter can be seen as an incomplete list of disallowed inputs.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-187** is based on the specific technical detail of using `startsWith`. The other suggested CWEs, such as **CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key**, **CWE-201 Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data**, and **CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**, do not accurately describe the **ROOTCAUSE** of the vulnerability. **CWE-639** is not applicable because the bypass is not due to a user-controlled key. **CWE-201** is not relevant as there's no mention of sensitive information being inserted into sent data. **CWE-918** is not applicable as the server is not making requests to other servers based on user input.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
