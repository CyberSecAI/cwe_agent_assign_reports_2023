CWE-362 has child CWEs such as CWE-366 and CWE-367, but the description doesn't provide enough specificity to determine if it's one of those. CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119, representing a specific type of memory corruption. It can follow CWE-362 in a vulnerability chain.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe366[\"CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\"]\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    \n    cwe362 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    cwe366 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe787,cwe119,cwe366,cwe367 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition** due to **improper synchronization** (CWE-362). This leads to **memory corruption**, which can be manifested as an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). Finally, the impact is local escalation of privilege.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified a **race condition** leading to **memory corruption** and local privilege escalation. The evidence strongly supports the presence of a **race condition** due to **improper synchronization** in the `ccd` component, as indicated by the key phrases and CVE reference summary. The primary CWE is CWE-362, as the root cause is the **concurrent execution** issue.\n\nThe retriever results also listed CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as a high match. While **memory corruption** is mentioned in the description, the precise nature of the corruption isn't detailed enough to definitively say it's an out-of-bounds write. However, the top CWEs for similar CVE descriptions includes CWE-787. Therefore, it's included as a secondary candidate.\n\nThe relationship analysis indicates that CWE-362 can precede CWE-787, aligning with the vulnerability description's progression from **race condition** to **memory corruption**.\n\nThe selection is based on the provided evidence. The phrase \"**race condition**\" maps directly to CWE-362. The phrase \"**memory corruption**\" is a likely impact of the **race condition**, and can often manifest as out-of-bounds write.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
