The vulnerability stems from an **improper update of reference count**.|\n| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE. Results from the incorrect reference count.|\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-911 (**Improper Update of Reference Count**), a Base-level CWE. This **improper update** leads directly to CWE-416 (**Use After Free**), a Variant-level CWE, where memory is accessed after it has been freed.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe911[\"CWE-911: Improper Update of Reference Count\"]\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource after Expiration\"]\n\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe911 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe672\n    cwe416 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe754\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe911 primary\n    class cwe416 secondary\n    class cwe825,cwe672 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **improper update of a reference count (CWE-911)** which leads to a **use-after-free condition (CWE-416)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment and final conclusion are strongly supported by the provided evidence. The vulnerability description highlights the **improper update of the reference count** as the root cause, directly leading to the **use-after-free**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further clarifies this, emphasizing the double-free condition resulting from the incorrect reference count decrement.\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-911 can precede CWE-672 (**Operation on Resource after Expiration**), and CWE-416 is a child of CWE-672 and CWE-825 (**Expired Pointer Dereference**).\n\nThe selection of CWE-911 and CWE-416 are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-911 as the root cause and CWE-416 as the resulting weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
