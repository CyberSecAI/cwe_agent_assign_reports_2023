The vulnerability description clearly states a **path traversal** vulnerability exists. |\n| CWE-288 | Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The **path traversal** leads to authentication bypass. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-22, which describes the root cause of the vulnerability. The secondary weakness is CWE-288, which describes the impact of the **path traversal**, leading to an authentication bypass.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n\n    cwe288 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe22\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe288 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **path traversal** (CWE-22), which then leads to an authentication bypass (CWE-288).\n  - The root cause is CWE-22.\n  - The impact is CWE-288.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly describes a **path traversal** vulnerability that leads to an authentication bypass. The relationship graph shows that CWE-22 can lead to CWE-288.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"NVIDIA BMC contains a vulnerability in SPX REST auth handler, where an un-authorized attacker can exploit a **path traversal**, which may lead to authentication bypass.\"\n\nThis evidence directly supports the selection of CWE-22 as the primary weakness, as it describes the **path traversal** vulnerability. The phrase \"may lead to authentication bypass\" supports the selection of CWE-288 as a secondary weakness, describing the potential impact of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as CWE-22 is a Base-level CWE that accurately describes the root cause of the vulnerability, and CWE-288 is a Base-level CWE that accurately describes the impact of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
