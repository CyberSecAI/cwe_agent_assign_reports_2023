CWE-267 is also considered because a privilege might have unsafe actions defined. CWE-863 is a Class-level CWE representing incorrect authorization, but is less specific than CWE-266.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe267[\"CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe266 -->|PeerOf| cwe267\n    cwe863 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|ChildOf| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe266 primary\n    class cwe267,cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **incorrect privilege assignment** (CWE-266), which allows an authenticated remote attacker with unprivileged credentials to **modify privileged management user credentials**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability allows an authenticated remote attacker with unprivileged credentials to modify privileged management user credentials. The **rootcause** is that the application **allows modification of privileged management user credentials**. The most suitable CWE is CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment). This is a base-level CWE that indicates that a product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor. The vulnerability description directly states that unprivileged users can modify privileged user credentials, which aligns with CWE-266.\n\nCWE-267 (Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions) is considered because a privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity. The vulnerability description doesn't directly suggest this, but the possibility exists that the assigned privileges allow for unintended actions.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is considered because the product performs an authorization check, but it does not correctly perform the check. This is a more general case than CWE-266, which focuses on the specific issue of incorrect privilege assignment. The retriever results show CWE-863 as a possible match but less specific.\n\nThe evidence is primarily based on the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section of the vulnerability description.\n\nThe final decision is to use CWE-266 as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability and is at the base level of abstraction. CWE-267 is included as a possible secondary weakness. CWE-863 is not selected as primary because it is less specific.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
