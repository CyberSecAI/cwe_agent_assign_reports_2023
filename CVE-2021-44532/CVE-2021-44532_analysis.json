This is related to certificate validation, but the issue is more specific to how the SANs are converted to strings. CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) and its variant CWE-297 (Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch) are also relevant but less direct because the core issue is with the string conversion and not the certificate validation process itself.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe115[\"CWE-115: Misinterpretation of Input\"]\n    cwe295[\"CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\"]\n    cwe297[\"CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch\"]\n    \n    cwe297 -->|CHILDOF| cwe295\n    cwe115 -->|PEEROF| cwe295\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe115 primary\n    class cwe295,cwe297 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper escaping of SANs** during conversion to a string format. This leads to a **misinterpretation of input** (CWE-115) during certificate validation, and finally the **bypass of name constraints**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **improper escaping** and the resulting bypass of name constraints. The primary CWE, CWE-115, reflects the core issue of misinterpreting the string format of SANs. The evidence supporting this includes:\n*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** \"**rootcause:** **improper escape of SANs in string format**\"\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** \"Node.js converts Subject Alternative Names (SANs) to a string format for certificate validation. This string format was vulnerable to injection when name constraints were used.\"\n\nThe graph relationships helped clarify that while certificate validation is involved (CWE-295, CWE-297), the root cause is the misinterpretation of the input string (CWE-115). Therefore, CWE-115 is at the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*   **Not Used:** While injection is a factor, this CWE is too broad. The issue is the string format and its interpretation.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*   **Not Used:** The issue is not about validating equivalence, but about how the input is interpreted.\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*   **Not Used:** This is specific to Expression Language, which is not the case here.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*   **Not Used:** Similar to CWE-74, this is too broad.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*   **Not Used:** The vulnerability is not due to an incomplete list of disallowed inputs, but due to **improper** handling of allowed inputs.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*   **Not Used:** This is close, but the core issue is how the already-encoded string is *interpreted*, not encoded itself.\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*   **Not Used:** While syntax is involved, the vulnerability is triggered by how the string is interpreted, not necessarily a failure of syntactic validation.\n\n## CWE-150: Improper Neutralization of Escape, Meta, or Control Sequences\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as escape, meta, or control character sequences when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*   **Not Used:** This CWE is too specific. It is not necessarily about escape, meta or control sequences, but broader.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and",
