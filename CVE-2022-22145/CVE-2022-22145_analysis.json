A more specific child, CWE-770 **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**, was also considered, as uncontrolled allocation is often a root cause of resource consumption issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves a **failure to properly control resource allocation**, leading to **uncontrolled resource consumption** and ultimately a **denial-of-service**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial vulnerability description explicitly states that the Yokogawa Electric products are vulnerable to **uncontrolled resource consumption**.\n> CAMS for HIS Log Server contained in the following Yokogawa Electric products is vulnerable to **uncontrolled resource consumption**.\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating:\n> **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400):** The server can be forced to consume excessive resources leading to denial of service.\n\nBased on this direct evidence, CWE-400 is the most appropriate primary mapping.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-400 **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** as a possible match, but the MITRE guidance discourages its use. However, it is still the best fit based on the description. The MITRE guidance states:\n> **Usage:** Discouraged\n> **Rationale:** CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the \"technical impact\" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n> **Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is causing resource consumption, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake. Consider children/descendants such as CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling, CWE-771: Missing Reference to Active Allocated Resource, CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool, CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime, CWE-834: Excessive Iteration, CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification), and others.\n\nCWE-770 **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling** is also considered since the root cause may be due to the allocation of resources without limits.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability description doesn't contain any information about incorrect implementations of authentication algorithms.\n\n## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product violates well-established principles for secure design.\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
