The **failure to properly restrict calling `git config`** leads to argument injection. |\n| CWE-94 | Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') | 0.7 | Base | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary CWE. The argument injection leads to the injection and execution of arbitrary code. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship impacting the decision is the chain relationship between CWE-88 and CWE-94. CWE-88 can lead to CWE-94, which fits the vulnerability description where **improper restriction of calling git config** (CWE-88) leads to remote code execution (CWE-94). Both are at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe88[\"CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe88 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe94\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe88 primary\n    class cwe94 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to properly restrict calling `git config`** (CWE-88), which allows an attacker to inject arguments, leading to the execution of arbitrary code (CWE-94).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **failure to properly restrict calling git config** as the root cause, leading to remote code execution. The retriever results and complete CWE specifications support this assessment. The relationship analysis confirms the chain from CWE-88 to CWE-94. The final decision is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description: \"**fails to properly restrict calling git config**\" and \"**allows an attacker to set the git core.sshCommand option, which sets git to use the specified command instead of ssh when they need to connect to a remote system**\".
