CWE-78, OS Command Injection, is a Base-level CWE and a ChildOf CWE-74, Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection'). CWE-78 can follow CWE-184, Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs. The selection of CWE-269 is based on the fact that the vulnerability allows a low-privileged user to trigger actions that execute with root privileges. CWE-78 is chosen because the low-privileged user can inject commands into a file.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe184[\"CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe184 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe78\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe269 primary\n    class cwe78,cwe74,cwe184 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of weaknesses starts with the **improper privilege management**, where a low-privileged user can influence a file that's used by a root user. This leads to **OS command injection**, where the low-privileged user injects arbitrary commands into the file. Finally, when the admin user executes specific commands, the injected commands are run with root privileges, resulting in privilege escalation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference content summary. The key phrase from the vulnerability description is \"**a file leveraged by a root user is executed when a low-privileged user runs specific commands**\". This indicates an issue with privilege management, leading to the selection of CWE-269. The CVE reference content summary further supports this by stating \"The vulnerability exists because a file leveraged by a *root* user is executed when a low-privileged user runs specific commands. This implies a lack of proper input sanitization or privilege separation when certain CLI commands are executed\" and \"Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269): The vulnerability allows a low-privileged user to trigger actions that execute with root privileges.\"\n\nCWE-78 is selected as a secondary CWE because the low-privileged user is able to inject commands. The CVE reference states \"Command Injection: Low-privileged users can inject arbitrary commands into a file that is later executed with root privileges.\"\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, with CWE-269 being a Class and CWE-78 being a Base. While CWE-269 is discouraged, it is appropriate here as the root cause is related to privileges.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
