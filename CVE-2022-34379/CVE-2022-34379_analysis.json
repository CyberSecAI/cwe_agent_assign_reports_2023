Because the vulnerability description explicitly states an \"**Authentication Bypass Vulnerability**\", the more specific CWE-288 was chosen over the more general CWE-287.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe288 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe288 primary\n    class cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Authentication Bypass Vulnerability** leading to unauthorized access to the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability based on the provided description and CVE details. The description clearly states an \"**Authentication Bypass Vulnerability**\" exists, which immediately suggests CWE-288 or CWE-287.\n\nThe analysis then considered the retriever results and the complete CWE specifications for each candidate. CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) is a Base level CWE and a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), a Class level CWE. Since the vulnerability description clearly states the existence of an authentication bypass, the more specific CWE-288 was chosen.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-288 was influenced by the MITRE mapping guidance, which recommends using the most specific CWE available. The evidence supports this decision because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions an authentication bypass.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n-

dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**:

0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-656: Reliance on Security Through Obscurity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism whose strength depends heavily on its obscurity, such that knowledge of its algorithms or key data is sufficient to defeat the mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent
