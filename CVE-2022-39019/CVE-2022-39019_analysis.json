CWE-434 is a base level CWE, which is preferred. It is a child of CWE-669: Incorrect Resource Transfer Neutralization. A secondary CWE to consider is CWE-284, Improper Access Control. It is a parent to CWE-862, CWE-863, CWE-732, CWE-306, CWE-1390, and CWE-923. Due to the rootcause of the vulnerability being **broken access controls**, CWE-284 is considered. However, CWE-284 is too high level of a CWE, so it is not the primary CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    cwe669[\"CWE-669: Incorrect Resource Transfer Neutralization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe434 -->|CHILDOF| cwe669\n    cwe284 --o|RELATED| cwe434\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe434 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **broken access controls** (potentially CWE-284), leading to the ability for unauthenticated attackers to upload malicious files (CWE-434), which can then be executed on the application server, potentially leading to further exploitation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the provided evidence, points to CWE-434 as the primary weakness, with CWE-284 as a related but higher-level concern.\n\nThe **Vulnerability Description** states \"Broken access controls on PDFtron WebviewerUI in M-Files Hubshare before 3.3.11.3 allows unauthenticated attackers to upload malicious files to the application server.\"\n\nThe **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** includes:\n- **rootcause:** **broken access controls**\n- **impact:** upload malicious files\n- **attacker:** unauthenticated attackers\n\nThe **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** states \"Root cause of vulnerability: **Broken access controls** in the PDFtron WebviewerUI component of M-Files Hubshare.\" and \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Unauthenticated file upload vulnerability.

The description \"The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment\" matches the **impact** of the vulnerability, which allows \"unauthenticated attackers to upload malicious files to the application server\". Therefore, this is the primary CWE.\n- CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) is a Pillar level CWE. While the **rootcause** of the vulnerability is **broken access controls**, the CWE is too high-level and vague. The description \"The product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor\" does describe the **rootcause** of the vulnerability, but is too generic. The mapping guidance recommends against using this CWE because it is \"extremely high-level\" and \"not useful for trend analysis\". Therefore, this is a secondary CWE.\n\nThe selection of CWE-434 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately captures the nature of the vulnerability, which is the ability to upload malicious files due to **broken access controls**. This is more specific than simply stating there is an access control issue (CWE-284), and aligns with the evidence that the vulnerability leads to unrestricted file uploads.",
