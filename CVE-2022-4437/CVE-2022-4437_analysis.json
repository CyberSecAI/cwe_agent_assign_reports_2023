CWE-416 is a child of CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference) and CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiration). It can be caused by CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size) or CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource after Expiration\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe120 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe416\n    cwe123 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe416\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe825,cwe672,cwe120, cwe123 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a crafted HTML page leading to a **use-after-free** condition in Mojo IPC which results in **heap corruption** and allows for remote code execution.\n  - Crafted HTML page -> **Use After Free** (CWE-416) -> **Heap Corruption**\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a **use-after-free** condition in Mojo IPC within Google Chrome. The key phrases section highlights \"**use after free**\" as the root cause and \"**heap corruption**\" as a weakness. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms \"**Use after free**\" as the root cause and lists \"**Use after free**\" as the weakness.\n\nThe Retriever Results list CWE-416 (Use After Free) as the top match. The CWE for similar CVE Descriptions lists CWE-416 as the Primary CWE Match.\n\nThe evidence directly supports the selection of CWE-416 (Use After Free) as the primary CWE. The confidence level is high (1.0) due to the explicit mention of \"use after free\" in the vulnerability description, key phrases, and CVE reference links content summary.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-843 (Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')): While heap corruption is mentioned, the root cause is directly identified as use-after-free, making CWE-416 a more precise fit.\n*   CWE-366 (Race Condition within a Thread): There's no explicit mention of a race condition in the provided vulnerability details.\n*   CWE-911 (Improper Update of Reference Count): No evidence suggests issues with reference counting.\n*   CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow): While heap corruption is an impact, the root cause is use-after-free.\n*   CWE-415 (Double Free): No evidence of a double free condition.\n*   CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition): While heap corruption could potentially lead to arbitrary writes, the root cause is use-after-free.\n*   CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')): No evidence of a race condition.\n*   CWE-356 (Product UI does not Warn User of Unsafe Actions): This is not related to the vulnerability described.\n*   CWE-404 (Improper Resource Shutdown or Release): While use-after-free involves resource management, it's more specific than a general improper shutdown or release.",
