# Analysis for CVE-2022-38375

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 1.0 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-285 | Improper Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), which is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). While the vulnerability description mentions "improper authorization," CWE-863 is more specific because it indicates that an authorization check is performed, but it is done incorrectly. This aligns well with the description stating that an unauthenticated user can perform administrative operations. The choice of CWE-863 reflects a more precise classification than its parent, CWE-285.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of root cause and weaknesses is as follows:
1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper Authorization [CWE-285]** leading to **Incorrect Authorization [CWE-863]**.
2.  **Weakness:** The FortiNAC system incorrectly performs authorization checks.
3.  **Impact:** An unauthenticated user can perform administrative operations.
4.  **Attack Vector:** Crafted HTTP POST requests.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment based on the vulnerability description and key phrases immediately points to an authorization issue. The description states "An **improper authorization vulnerability [CWE-285]**... allows an unauthenticated user to perform some administrative operations". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further reinforces this by stating "Root cause of vulnerability: Improper authorization" and "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: An **improper authorization vulnerability [CWE-285]** exists in FortiNAC".

The Retriever Results also list CWE-285 and CWE-863 as potential matches. However, CWE-285 is discouraged due to its high-level nature. CWE-863, while also a Class, is more specific because it indicates that an authorization check is performed, but incorrectly. This is a crucial distinction. The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to perform administrative operations via crafted HTTP POST requests, meaning that the system attempts to authorize the request, but fails to do so correctly. This incorrect check is better captured by CWE-863.

The relationship analysis confirms this. CWE-863 is a child of CWE-285 and CWE-284. The mapping guidance for CWE-863 suggests examining its children to see if there's a better fit, but in this case, CWE-863 itself is the most appropriate.

The decision to use CWE-863 is based on the evidence provided, relationship analysis, and mapping guidance, ensuring that the selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity. I am overriding the general mapping guidance that discourages using CWE-285 in favor of the more specific CWE-863 which captures the specific authorization check error.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76

The authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too
