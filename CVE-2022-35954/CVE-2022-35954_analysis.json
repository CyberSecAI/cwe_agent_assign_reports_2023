While it is not a perfect fit, there isn't a more specific child that directly addresses the injection of a delimiter into an environment variable in this way. CWE-526, while related to environment variables, doesn't fully capture the injection aspect. The chain relationship isn't strongly applicable here, but the injection allows modification of other variables.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe526[\"CWE-526: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in an Environment Variable\"]\n    \n    cwe526 -->|CHILDOF| cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe74 primary\n    class cwe526 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling** of a known delimiter. This allows for **injection** of arbitrary commands into the `GITHUB_ENV` file. The final impact is **arbitrary environment variable modification**, potentially leading to workflow hijacking or privilege escalation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, several CWEs were considered based on the retriever results, including CWE-74, CWE-863, and CWE-201. However, the core of the vulnerability lies in the ability to inject commands due to the **improper handling** of the delimiter.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"The `core.exportVariable` function uses a well known delimiter that attackers can use to break out of that specific variable and assign values to other arbitrary variables. Workflows that write untrusted values to the `GITHUB_ENV` file may cause the path or other environment variables to be modified without the intention of the workflow or action author.\"\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this: \"**Delimiter Injection:** The predictable delimiter allowed attackers to inject arbitrary commands into the `GITHUB_ENV` file by including the delimiter in the variable name or value. This allowed them to break out of the intended variable and set other environment variables.\"\n\nCWE-74, despite being a class-level CWE, best captures this **injection** aspect. It describes \"the product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\" While the downstream component isn't explicitly code execution, the modification of environment variables achieves a similar effect by altering the execution environment.\n\nCWE-526 is a less direct mapping, since the environment variable itself isn't the primary issue; it's the ability to control its content through **injection** that's the problem. However, it is relevant because the environment variable is the vehicle for the injected content.\n\nThe choice of CWE-74 is primarily based on the **injection** aspect of the vulnerability. While it's a high-level CWE, it is the most accurate representation of the **root cause**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
