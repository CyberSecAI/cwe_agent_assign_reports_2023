The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the use of an implicit intent. |\n| CWE-285 | Improper Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability description mentions **improper access control**, which is related to authorization. While it's a class-level CWE, it helps capture the broader issue of authorization failure. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE, CWE-927 (Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication), is a variant of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere). While CWE-285 is a high-level class, it provides context for the more specific CWE-927, highlighting the underlying authorization issue that makes the implicit intent exploitable.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe927[\"CWE-927: Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe927 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe927 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe927 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control** leading to the use of an implicit intent for sensitive communication, which then results in the exposure of sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary classification is CWE-927 because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the use of an implicit intent, which aligns perfectly with the CWE's focus. The vulnerability description key phrases also mention implicit intent and **improper access control**, further reinforcing this classification.\n\nThe secondary classification, CWE-285, captures the broader **improper access control** issue. Although it's a class-level CWE and discouraged, it's included to represent the underlying authorization failure that allows the implicit intent to be exploited.\n\nThe selection of CWE-927 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause, which is the use of implicit intents for sensitive communication.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
