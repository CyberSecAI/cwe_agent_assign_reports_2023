CWE-1321 is a Variant of both CWE-915 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes) and CWE-913 (Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources). This indicates that CWE-1321 is a specific case of a more general class of weaknesses related to improper control of object attributes. Given the specific nature of the **prototype pollution** vulnerability, CWE-1321 provides the most accurate and detailed classification.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1321[\"CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\"]\n    cwe915[\"CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\"]\n    \n    cwe1321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe915\n    cwe1321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1321 primary\n    class cwe915,cwe913 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the lack of input validation in the `collide()` function, leading to **prototype pollution**, and culminating in potential denial of service (DoS) and remote code execution (RCE).\n\n`Lack of Input Validation` -> `Prototype Pollution (CWE-1321)` -> `DoS and/or RCE`\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The description explicitly mentions \"**prototype pollution**\" as the **rootcause**, which aligns perfectly with CWE-1321. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further confirms that the `collide()` function lacks proper validation of input, allowing attackers to modify the prototype of Object, leading to DoS and potential RCE.\n\nThe graph relationships also influenced the selection, confirming that CWE-1321 is a specific type of improperly controlled modification of object attributes. This level of specificity is crucial for accurate vulnerability classification.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1321 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **rootcause** of the vulnerability which is **prototype pollution**. While other CWEs like CWE-915 are related, they are more general and do not specifically capture the nuances of **prototype pollution**. The evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-1321 as the primary CWE for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale:

combined objects.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the

is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary

to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe

Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one

than the correct value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 6174.77\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component that specifies attributes that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not

preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes\n**Abstraction Level**:
