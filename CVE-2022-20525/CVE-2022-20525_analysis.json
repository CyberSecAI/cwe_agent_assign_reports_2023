The secondary CWE, CWE-209, is a Base-level weakness involving the generation of error messages containing sensitive information. CWE-862 is a parent of more specific authorization-related weaknesses. CWE-209 can be a consequence of other weaknesses, where sensitive data is exposed due to improper error handling. The choice of CWE-862 reflects the **permissions bypass** as the root cause, while CWE-209 highlights the information leak impact.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n    cwe755[\"CWE-755: Exception Handling\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe209 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe209 -->|CHILDOF| cwe755\n    cwe209 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe756\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe209 secondary\n    class cwe200,cwe285,cwe755 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **permissions bypass** (CWE-862), leading to the leak of the visual voicemail package name, which is sensitive data. The package name is then exposed through exception logging (CWE-209).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the resulting impact. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **permissions bypass**, which strongly suggests CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" reinforces this by stating that the \"visual voicemail package name is considered sensitive data and should not be exposed in exception logs,\" indicating an information disclosure issue, which aligns with CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information).\n\nThe retriever results listed CWE-862 as the top match. CWE-209 was also listed and considered a secondary weakness.\n\nThe evidence supports the selection of CWE-862 as the primary weakness because the vulnerability stems from the lack of proper authorization checks. The exposure of the visual voicemail package name via exception logging is a consequence of this missing authorization, making CWE-209 a relevant secondary weakness. Both CWEs are at appropriate levels of specificity (Class and Base, respectively).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize a critical resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses or accesses a resource that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
