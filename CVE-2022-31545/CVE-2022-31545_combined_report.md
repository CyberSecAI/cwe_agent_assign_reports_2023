*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-22, is a base class for **Path Traversal** vulnerabilities. CWE-36 (Absolute Path Traversal) is a child of CWE-22, representing a specific type of path traversal using absolute paths. CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) can precede CWE-22, as external control over file names/paths is often a prerequisite for path traversal. This hierarchical and chain relationship helps to clarify the vulnerability, with CWE-22 as the core issue and CWE-36 as a specific manifestation, and CWE-73 as the enabler.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events is as follows:
1.  External control of the filename parameter via user input (`flask.send_file` with attacker controlled `filename` parameter).
2.  **Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory** (**Path Traversal**) due to lack of sanitization of the input, allowing the attacker to specify an absolute path.
3.  Access to arbitrary files on the server, leading to information disclosure.

The root cause is the **improper** handling of the filename parameter, leading to the **Path Traversal** vulnerability.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified CWE-22, CWE-36, and CWE-73 as the most relevant CWEs. The final decision was based on the vulnerability description, CVE Reference Links Content Summary, and the Retriever Results. The vulnerability involves an **absolute path traversal** due to the unsafe use of the `send_file` function in Flask.

The evidence supports the selection of CWE-22 because the application **does not properly neutralize** special elements within the pathname, allowing it to resolve to a location outside the restricted directory. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" states: "The vulnerability allows attackers to specify arbitrary file paths, potentially accessing sensitive files or directories outside the intended web root or project directory."

CWE-36 is also relevant because the vulnerability specifically involves **absolute path traversal**. The "Vulnerability Description" states the vulnerability is an **absolute path traversal**.

CWE-73 is included because the vulnerability stems from external control over the file name or path. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" indicates the vulnerability is caused by the usage of `flask.send_file` with attacker controlled `filename` parameter.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-22 as the primary weakness and CWE-36 and CWE-73 providing further context.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-31545

## Vulnerability Description
The ml-inory/ModelConverter repository through 2021-04-26 on GitHub allows **absolute path traversal** because the Flask send_file function is used unsafely.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **absolute path traversal**
- **product:** ml-inory/ModelConverter
- **version:** through 2021-04-26

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability, CVE-2022-31545:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the unsafe use of the `send_file` function in Flask applications. Specifically, the `send_file` function was being used to directly serve files based on user-provided input without proper sanitization or validation of the file path.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The vulnerability allows attackers to specify arbitrary file paths, potentially accessing sensitive files or directories outside the intended web root or project directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Impact (High):** Attackers can potentially read arbitrary files on the server, exposing sensitive data, source code, or configuration files.
*   **Integrity Impact (None):** The vulnerability does not allow modification of data on the server.
*   **Availability Impact (Low):** While the vulnerability can potentially allow access to system files, the immediate impact on availability is low. However, multiple requests for large files could cause some level of denial of service.
*   **Scope Change:** The vulnerability can affect resources beyond the application's intended scope, making it more severe.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit it remotely.
*   **Attack Complexity: Low:** The attack complexity is low, as it does not require special conditions to be present for successful exploitation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Privileges Required: None:** No specific privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction: None:** No user interaction is required for the vulnerability to be exploited.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability is caused by the usage of `flask.send_file` with attacker controlled `filename` parameter. The `send_file` function will use the given parameter value to read the data from disk and respond to user. If the attacker provide an absolute path, they can bypass the intention of the application developers and read arbitary file from disk, bypassing the web root. 

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided content indicates that this vulnerability was discovered using CodeQL and disclosed by porcupineyhairs
* The vulnerability was identified in the  `ml-inory/ModelConverter` repository, along with numerous other repositories which is also using flask's `send_file` unsafely.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 9.3, categorized as "Critical."

**Remediation:**

*   The vulnerability can be remediated by using `flask.safe_join` to ensure that only the intended paths are being accessed, or, using `flask.send_from_directory`, rather than `flask.send_file`.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

### Extended Description


Many file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as ".." and "/" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the "../" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as "/usr/local/bin" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.


### Alternative Terms
Directory traversal
Path traversal: "Path traversal" is preferred over "directory traversal," but both terms are attack-focused.

### Additional Notes
**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add ".txt" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.

**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.

**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing "/" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).

**[Terminology]** 

Like other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use "directory traversal" only to refer to the injection of ".." and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.


Other variants like "absolute pathname" and "drive letter" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve ".." or equivalent.


**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.

**[Research Gap]** 

Incomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that "..\" is vulnerable, but not test "../" which may also be vulnerable.


Any combination of directory separators ("/", "\", etc.) and numbers of "." (e.g. "....") can produce unique variants; for example, the "//../" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama
- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the "\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)




## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as "/abs/path" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

### Extended Description
This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.

- **CVE-2002-1345:** Multiple FTP clients write arbitrary files via absolute paths in server responses
- **CVE-2001-1269:** ZIP file extractor allows full path




## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

### Extended Description


This could allow an attacker to access or modify system files or other files that are critical to the application.


Path manipulation errors occur when the following two conditions are met:

```
		1. An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.
		2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.
```
For example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker.

**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** CWE-114 is a Class, but it is listed a child of CWE-73 in view 1000. This suggests some abstraction problems that should be resolved in future versions.

**[Relationship]** 

The external control of filenames can be the primary link in chains with other file-related weaknesses, as seen in the CanPrecede relationships. This is because software systems use files for many different purposes: to execute programs, load code libraries, to store application data, to store configuration settings, record temporary data, act as signals or semaphores to other processes, etc.


However, those weaknesses do not always require external control. For example, link-following weaknesses (CWE-59) often involve pathnames that are not controllable by the attacker at all.


The external control can be resultant from other issues. For example, in PHP applications, the register_globals setting can allow an attacker to modify variables that the programmer thought were immutable, enabling file inclusion (CWE-98) and path traversal (CWE-22). Operating with excessive privileges (CWE-250) might allow an attacker to specify an input filename that is not directly readable by the attacker, but is accessible to the privileged program. A buffer overflow (CWE-119) might give an attacker control over nearby memory locations that are related to pathnames, but were not directly modifiable by the attacker.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)
- **CVE-2008-5748:** Chain: external control of values for user's desired language and theme enables path traversal.
- **CVE-2008-5764:** Chain: external control of user's target language enables remote file inclusion.




## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

### Extended Description
This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.

### Alternative Terms
Zip Slip: "Zip slip" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282]. It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).

### Extended Description


This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.


The "../" manipulation is the canonical manipulation for operating systems that use "/" as directory separators, such as UNIX- and Linux-based systems.

### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** 

Link following vulnerabilities are Multi-factor Vulnerabilities (MFV). They are the combination of multiple elements: file or directory permissions, filename predictability, race conditions, and in some cases, a design limitation in which there is no mechanism for performing atomic file creation operations.


Some potential factors are race conditions, permissions, and predictability.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-1999-1386:** Some versions of Perl follow symbolic links when running with the -e option, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.
- **CVE-2000-1178:** Text editor follows symbolic links when creating a rescue copy during an abnormal exit, which allows local users to overwrite the files of other users.
