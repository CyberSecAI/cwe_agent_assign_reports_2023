While CWE-441 describes a broader class of vulnerabilities, the specific vulnerability described in the report clearly fits the definition of CWE-918, making it a more precise classification. The abstraction levels influenced the selection, choosing the Base level CWE-918 over the Class level CWE-441.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe441[\"CWE-441: Unintended Proxy or Intermediary ('Confused Deputy')\"]\n    \n    cwe918 -->|CHILDOF| cwe441\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe918 primary\n    class cwe441 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the lack of input validation on the `remote_url` parameter, leading to the SSRF vulnerability. The sequence is:\n1.  **Root Cause:** Missing input validation on `remote_url`.\n2.  **Weakness:** CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).\n3.  **Impact:** Arbitrary requests to internal resources or external services.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **Server-Side Request Forgery** as the root cause based on the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\".\n\nThe commit mitigates the vulnerability by implementing the `check_session_tracks` function to ensure that the requested `remote_url` is present in the user's session. The session object is populated during the loading of the IGV tracks, so this ensures that only files the user has access to can be loaded via the `remote_cors` function.\n\nThe provided evidence strongly supports CWE-918 as the primary weakness. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" clearly states that the `remote_cors` function was vulnerable to SSRF due to a lack of proper input validation on the `remote_url` parameter. This allowed an attacker to supply an arbitrary URL, potentially allowing the server to make requests to internal resources or external services.\n\nThe Retriever Results also list CWE-918 as the top candidate.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence, the relationships between CWEs, and the MITRE mapping guidance. CWE-918 is at the optimal level of specificity, accurately representing the weakness described in the vulnerability report.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following
