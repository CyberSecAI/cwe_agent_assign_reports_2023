CWE-1004 and CWE-614 are both variants related to the secure handling of cookies. CWE-1004 directly addresses the **failure to set the HTTPOnly flag**, while CWE-614 addresses the absence of the 'Secure' attribute. They are related to CWE-319, Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1004[\"CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag\"]\n    cwe614[\"CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    \n    cwe1004 -->|CHILDOF| cwe732\n    cwe614 -->|CHILDOF| cwe319\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1004 primary\n    class cwe614,cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to set the HTTPOnly flag** on a sensitive cookie (CWE-1004). This allows a remote attacker to potentially obtain sensitive information from the cookie. If the Secure flag isn't also set, it could lead to CWE-319, Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **failure to set the HTTPOnly flag** which is the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly states this **failure to set the HTTPOnly flag**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by mentioning the absence of the 'Secure' and 'HttpOnly' flags on the BAYEUX_BROWSER cookie and how this exposes the cookie to potential theft or manipulation.\n\nCWE-1004 is the most specific and directly addresses the identified weakness which is the **failure to set the HTTPOnly flag** on a sensitive cookie.\n\nCWE-614 was considered because the CVE also talks about the missing Secure Flag.\n\nCWE-319 was considered because not setting the secure flag could result in transmission of sensitive information in cleartext.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1004 is based on the direct evidence of the **failure to set the HTTPOnly flag**. It is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is preferred.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-300: Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not adequately verify the identity of actors at both ends of a communication channel, or does not adequately ensure the integrity of the channel, in a way that allows the channel to be accessed or influenced by an actor that is not an endpoint.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-300 is commonly misused for vulnerabilities in which the prerequisites for exploitation require the adversary to be in a privileged \"in-the-middle\" position.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
