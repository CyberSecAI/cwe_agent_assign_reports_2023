CWE-328 is a child of CWE-327 (Class) and CWE-326 (Class). CWE-327 is \"Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\" which is a broader classification. CWE-916 (Base) \"Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\" is also a child of CWE-327 and CWE-328. The vulnerability uses CRC-16 as the hashing algorithm, which is not cryptographically secure and easily allows for collision attacks.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe326[\"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\"]\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    \n    cwe328 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    cwe328 -->|CHILDOF| cwe326\n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe328\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe328 primary\n    class cwe327,cwe916,cwe326 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of an insecure hashing algorithm** (CRC-16), which leads to **weak credential hashing scheme**, and finally results in authentication bypass, which allows attackers to manipulate controller configurations.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-328 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of an insecure hashing algorithm (CRC-16) being used for password authentication. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-328, which focuses on the use of algorithms that do not meet security expectations for a hash function.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"The hashing algorithm used is based on CRC-16 and as such not cryptographically secure. An **insecure hashing algorithm** is used.\" This statement directly supports the selection of CWE-328.\n\nThe retriever results also support this selection, with CWE-328 being a top match. The evidence is strong, and the confidence in this mapping is high.\n\nCWE-327 is considered as a secondary weakness. The vulnerability description mentions \"Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\". CWE-327 is a more general class of weakness and \"might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\". Since CWE-328 provides a more specific classification, it is selected as the primary weakness and CWE-327 as a secondary weakness.\n\nCWE-916 is considered as a secondary weakness since the hashing algorithm used doesn't provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-328 being a Base level weakness that accurately reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability.",
