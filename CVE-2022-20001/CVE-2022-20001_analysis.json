This is related to CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) as CWE-78 is a child of it. CWE-73 is related because the filename/path is externally controlled, which can then be used to inject commands.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe78\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the user changing the directory to one controlled by an attacker. The attacker has placed a malicious `.git` configuration in that directory. When the `fish` shell attempts to display information about the current git repository, it executes the malicious git configuration, leading to arbitrary code execution.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements** (CWE-78) and **External Control of Filename/Path** (CWE-73)\n  - **Weakness:** Fish shell executing git commands based on directory\n  - **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-78 as the primary candidate because the vulnerability stems from the `fish` shell executing `git` commands without properly sanitizing the git configuration, leading to arbitrary code execution. The `CVE Reference Links Content Summary` section states: \"The `fish` shell was not sanitizing or restricting the git configuration options that could be executed when the `fish_git_prompt` function was triggered.\" This aligns with CWE-78, which describes a situation where a product constructs an OS command using externally-influenced input but does not neutralize special elements.\n\nCWE-73 is a secondary weakness, as the attacker needs to control the filename or path (in this case, the `.git` directory and its configuration files).\n\nThe retriever results also support this analysis, with CWE-78 and CWE-73 listed as relevant.\n\nThe selection is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference. CWE-78 accurately captures the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the file is a symbolic link that resolves to a target outside of the intended control sphere.
