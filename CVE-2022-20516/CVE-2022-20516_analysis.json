It can precede CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). The vulnerability description indicates an integer overflow which directly leads to an out-of-bounds read. This aligns with the relationship where CWE-190 can lead to memory corruption issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe190 -->|ROOT_CAUSE| cwe125\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe125 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) leading to an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) which results in remote information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-190 as the primary cause, supported by the key phrase \"**integer overflow**\" in the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The description explicitly states that the **integer overflow** leads to an out of bounds read, so CWE-125 is added as a secondary effect.\n\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, especially the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary which pinpoint the root cause as an **integer overflow**.\n\nThe relationship graph highlights how CWE-190 can precede CWE-119, and in this specific case, it directly leads to CWE-125.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause (**integer overflow**) and the immediate consequence (out-of-bounds read).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values. If the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Selected:** There is no evidence to suggest an incorrect conversion between numeric types occurred. The vulnerability description and CVE reference mention only an **integer overflow**.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Selected:** The vulnerability description and CVE reference specify an **integer overflow**, not an underflow.\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Selected:** The vulnerability description and CVE reference do not mention any truncation errors.\n\n## CWE-704: Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly convert an object, resource, or structure from one type to a different type.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Why Not Selected:** There is no evidence to suggest an incorrect type conversion or cast.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Selected:** While the vulnerability involves an out-of-bounds read, it is caused by an **integer overflow** and not necessarily an incorrect calculation of buffer size.\n\n## CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that generates incorrect or unintended results that are later used in security-critical decisions or resource management.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. In many cases, lower-level children or descendants are more appropriate. However, sometimes this weakness is forced to be used due to the lack of in-depth weakness research. See Research Gaps.\n\n**Why Not Selected:** This is a Pillar level CWE and too general. CWE-190 is a more specific Base level CWE.\n\n## CWE-680: Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation to determine how much memory to allocate, but an integer overflow can occur that causes less memory to be allocated than expected, leading to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a named chain, which combines multiple weaknesses.\n\n**Why Not Selected:** While the end result is an out-of-bounds read (similar to a buffer overflow), the description explicitly mentions an **integer overflow** as the root cause, not a chain leading to a buffer overflow during memory allocation.\n\n## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Selected:** There is no evidence to suggest type confusion is involved.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Selected:** There is no evidence to suggest improper validation of unsafe equivalence in input.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 4978.48\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Selected:** The vulnerability description mentions \"out of bounds read",
