The secondary CWE, CWE-1021 (Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames), is related to CWE-441 (Unintended Proxy or Intermediary), CWE-610 (Reliance on HTTP Referer Field), and CWE-451 (User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information). There is no direct relationship between CWE-125 and CWE-1021. CWE-204 (Observable Response Discrepancy) is a child of CWE-203 (Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Inconsistent Behavior).

The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this interpretation.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n- CWE-131 is not selected because the vulnerability description does not explicitly mention incorrect buffer size calculation.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n- CWE-191 is not selected because there is no evidence of integer underflow in the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n- CWE-805 is not selected because it is similar to CWE-125, but CWE-125 is a more direct match for the **data leak** description.\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\n- CWE-126 is not selected because it is a variant of out-of-bounds read, but CWE-125 is a more general and suitable match.\n\n## CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses or accesses a resource that has not been initialized.\n- CWE-908 is not selected because the vulnerability description does not indicate the use of uninitialized resources.\n\n## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.\n- CWE-843 is not selected because there is no mention of incompatible types being used.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n- CWE-404 is not selected because resource shutdown or release is not part of the description.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n- CWE-667 is not selected because there is no mention of locking issues.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n- CWE-226 is not selected because the description does not involve sensitive information not being removed before reuse.\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity",
