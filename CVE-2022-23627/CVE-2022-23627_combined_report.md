# Analysis for CVE-2022-23627

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 1.0 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing my decision is the hierarchical structure between CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), and CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function). CWE-863 is a child of CWE-285, indicating a more specific type of authorization issue. Since the vulnerability involves an **incorrect access verification**, CWE-863 is more appropriate than its parent. CWE-306 is also under CWE-287 which is a peer of CWE-284 and parent to CWE-285, but it indicates a complete lack of authentication which is not the case here.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with the **inadequate access verification** in the ASF application. This leads to the ability to access resources beyond those configured, ultimately resulting in a confidentiality breach.

## Summary of Analysis
My analysis concludes that the primary CWE for this vulnerability is CWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**) and a possible secondary is CWE-306 (**Missing Authentication for Critical Function**).

The primary decision is heavily based on the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The **root cause** is described as an "**inadequate access verification**" when proxy commands are used. The system incorrectly verifies access against the source bot instead of the target bot. This directly aligns with the description of CWE-863, which states: "The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check."

The evidence supporting this decision includes:

*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** "**rootcause:** **inadequate access verification**"
*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** "**Inadequate Access Control:** The core issue is the flawed logic in verifying user permissions when proxying commands. The system mistakenly checks access against the source bot instead of the target bot, leading to privilege escalation."

While CWE-306 (**Missing Authentication for Critical Function**) was also considered due to the lack of proper verification on the target bot, it was deemed less accurate because the vulnerability isn't a complete absence of authentication but rather a flawed authorization process. The ASF application *does* perform authentication, but the authorization check is performed against the wrong entity.

The hierarchical relationship between CWE-285 and CWE-863 reinforces the choice of the latter. CWE-863 is a more specific child of CWE-285, making it a better fit for the described vulnerability.

The retriever results also support the selection of CWE-863, with a high similarity score.

The final decision to use CWE-863 as the primary CWE is based on the direct evidence of **incorrect access verification**, the hierarchical relationship of CWEs, and the MITRE mapping guidance. This CWE is at the Class level of abstraction, but since there isn't a better fit at the Base level, it is deemed appropriate. CWE-306 is considered a secondary candidate as it highlights a missing check on the target bot, but it's not the primary **root cause**.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-23627

## Vulnerability Description
ArchiSteamFarm (ASF) is a C# application with primary purpose of idling Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously. Due to a bug in ASF code, introduced in version V5.2.2.2, the program didnt adequately verify effective access of the user sending proxy (i.e. `[Bots]`) commands. In particular, a proxy-like command sent to bot `A` targeting bot `B` has incorrectly verified users access against bot `A` - instead of bot `B`, to which the command was originally designated. This in result allowed access to resources beyond those configured, being a security threat affecting confidentiality of other bot instances. A successful attack exploiting this bug requires a significant access granted explicitly by original owner of the ASF process prior to that, as attacker has to control at least a single bot in the process to make use of this **inadequate access verification** loophole. The issue is patched in ASF V5.2.2.5, V5.2.3.2 and future versions. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **inadequate access verification**
- **impact:** access resources beyond those configured
- **vector:** proxy-like commands
- **product:** ArchiSteamFarm (ASF)
- **version:** V5.2.2.2

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23627:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from inadequate access verification when using proxy commands in ArchiSteamFarm (ASF). Specifically, when a command is proxied from one bot (`A`) to another (`B`), the system incorrectly verifies the user's access against bot `A` instead of the intended target, bot `B`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The core issue is the flawed logic in verifying user permissions when proxying commands. The system mistakenly checks access against the source bot instead of the target bot, leading to privilege escalation.
*   **Incorrect Proxy Command Handling**: When a proxy-like command is sent to bot `A` targeting bot `B`, the access check for the command execution was done against bot `A` instead of bot `B`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker with access to one bot could potentially gain access to resources and information of other bots within the same ASF process, bypassing the intended access controls.
*   **Privilege Escalation**: An attacker who has access to one bot can execute commands on other bots, which are otherwise inaccessible, allowing them to perform actions they aren't supposed to.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Proxy Commands:** The attack is carried out by using proxy commands. These are commands that are sent through one bot to target and execute on another.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to at Least One Bot:** The attacker needs prior access to at least one bot within the ASF process. This access is granted by the owner. This limits the scope of the attack since the attacker must have prior access, so they can't exploit it if they aren't an authorized user.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send commands to the vulnerable ASF instance.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in version 5.2.2.2 of ASF.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in versions 5.2.2.5 and 5.2.3.2
*   The fix was implemented in commit `f807bdb` and pull request #2509.
*   The issue was originally introduced in pull request #2501
*   The vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" severity with a CVSS score of 5.0.
*   CVSS v3 base metrics: AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N

This detailed breakdown provides a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability, its impact, and how it can be exploited.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships

ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).
- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
- **CVE-2021-3116:** Chain: Python-based HTTP Proxy server uses the wrong boolean operators (CWE-480) causing an incorrect comparison (CWE-697) that identifies an authN failure if all three conditions are met instead of only one, allowing bypass of the proxy authentication (CWE-1390)




## CWE-441: Unintended Proxy or Intermediary ('Confused Deputy')
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product receives a request, message, or directive from an upstream component, but the product does not sufficiently preserve the original source of the request before forwarding the request to an external actor that is outside of the product's control sphere. This causes the product to appear to be the source of the request, leading it to act as a proxy or other intermediary between the upstream component and the external actor.

### Extended Description


If an attacker cannot directly contact a target, but the product has access to the target, then the attacker can send a request to the product and have it be forwarded to the target. The request would appear to be coming from the product's system, not the attacker's system. As a result, the attacker can bypass access controls (such as firewalls) or hide the source of malicious requests, since the requests would not be coming directly from the attacker.


Since proxy functionality and message-forwarding often serve a legitimate purpose, this issue only becomes a vulnerability when:


  - The product runs with different privileges or on a different system, or otherwise has different levels of access than the upstream component;

  - The attacker is prevented from making the request directly to the target; and

  - The attacker can create a request that the proxy does not explicitly intend to be forwarded on the behalf of the requester. Such a request might point to an unexpected hostname, port number, hardware IP, or service. Or, the request might be sent to an allowed service, but the request could contain disallowed directives, commands, or resources.



### Alternative Terms
Confused Deputy: This weakness is sometimes referred to as the "Confused deputy" problem, in which an attacker misused the authority of one victim (the "confused deputy") when targeting another victim.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-610
CanPrecede -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness has a chaining relationship with CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) because the proxy effectively provides the attacker with access to the target's resources that the attacker cannot directly obtain.

**[Maintenance]** This could possibly be considered as an emergent resource.

**[Theoretical]** It could be argued that the "confused deputy" is a fundamental aspect of most vulnerabilities that require an active attacker. Even for common implementation issues such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, OS command injection, and path traversal, the vulnerable program already has the authorization to run code or access files. The vulnerability arises when the attacker causes the program to run unexpected code or access unexpected files.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-1999-0017:** FTP bounce attack. The design of the protocol allows an attacker to modify the PORT command to cause the FTP server to connect to other machines besides the attacker's.
- **CVE-1999-0168:** RPC portmapper could redirect service requests from an attacker to another entity, which thinks the requests came from the portmapper.
- **CVE-2005-0315:** FTP server does not ensure that the IP address in a PORT command is the same as the FTP user's session, allowing port scanning by proxy.




## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Unrestricted File Upload: Used in vulnerability databases and elsewhere, but it is insufficiently precise. The phrase could be interpreted as the lack of restrictions on the size or number of uploaded files, which is a resource consumption issue.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-669
ChildOf -> CWE-669
PeerOf -> CWE-351
PeerOf -> CWE-436
PeerOf -> CWE-430

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

This can have a chaining relationship with incomplete denylist / permissive allowlist errors when the product tries, but fails, to properly limit which types of files are allowed (CWE-183, CWE-184).


This can also overlap multiple interpretation errors for intermediaries, e.g. anti-virus products that do not remove or quarantine attachments with certain file extensions that can be processed by client systems.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-5227:** PHP-based FAQ management app does not check the MIME type for uploaded images
- **CVE-2001-0901:** Web-based mail product stores ".shtml" attachments that could contain SSI
- **CVE-2002-1841:** PHP upload does not restrict file types




## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data

### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Sensitive information could include data that is sensitive in and of itself (such as credentials or private messages), or otherwise useful in the further exploitation of the system (such as internal file system structure).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses




## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** 

Note: there are 2 separate sub-categories here:

```
		- privilege incorrectly allows entities to perform certain actions
		- object is incorrectly accessible to entities with a given privilege
```




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-1981:** Roles have access to dangerous procedures (Accessible entities).
- **CVE-2002-1671:** Untrusted object/method gets access to clipboard (Accessible entities).
- **CVE-2004-2204:** Gain privileges using functions/tags that should be restricted (Accessible entities).




## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description


Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.


When access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.


### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships

ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.
**Reasons:**

**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information
- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.
- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.
