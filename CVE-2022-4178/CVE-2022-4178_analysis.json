The selection of CWE-416 as the primary is due to the explicit mention of \"use after free\" in the vulnerability description. CWE-416 can also be part of a chain, where it can follow CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size), CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource after Expiration or Release\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n    \n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe120 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe416\n    cwe123 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe416\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe825,cwe672,cwe120,cwe123 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **use after free** condition in Mojo, leading to **heap corruption**, which a remote attacker can exploit.\n  - Initial Flaw: **Use After Free** (CWE-416)\n  - Resulting Weakness: **Heap corruption**\n  - Impact: Remote attacker exploits via crafted HTML page.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points to CWE-416 (Use After Free) due to the explicit mention in the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The retriever results also list CWE-416 as the top match. The description states \"Use after free in Mojo in Google Chrome prior to 108.0.5359.71 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to potentially exploit **heap corruption** via a crafted HTML page.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms the root cause as \"Use-after-free in Mojo\" and lists \"Use-after-free. This occurs when a program attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior.\"\n\nCWE-672, Operation on Resource after Expiration or Release, was considered as a potential secondary CWE, as CWE-416 is a ChildOf CWE-672. It broadly captures the essence of operating on a resource that is no longer valid. However, given the specific identification of \"use after free\", CWE-416 is more precise.\n\nCWE-416 is selected because it is the most specific and directly applicable CWE based on the provided evidence.
