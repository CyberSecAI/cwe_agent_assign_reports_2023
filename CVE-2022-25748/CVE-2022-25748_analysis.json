CWE-190 is a child of CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) and CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation). CWE-120 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).

This is based on the **rootcause** identified in the vulnerability description key phrases: \"**integer overflow to buffer overflow**\".\n\nCWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) is selected as the primary CWE because the **integer overflow** is the initial cause of the vulnerability. The description of CWE-190 states, \"The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value.\" This aligns with the vulnerability description.\n\nCWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')) is selected as a secondary CWE because the **integer overflow** leads to a **buffer overflow**. The description of CWE-120 states, \"The product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.\" The mapping guidance for CWE-120 suggests review because it is often misused. However, in this case, it is appropriate since the integer overflow leads to an unchecked buffer copy.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer): This is a more general class, and CWE-120 is a more specific instance of a buffer overflow. Also, CWE-119 is discouraged.\n*   CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read) and CWE-124 (Buffer Underwrite): The vulnerability description does not indicate a read or write outside the bounds of the buffer directly, but rather a buffer overflow due to an integer overflow.\n*   CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input): This is related to input validation, but the primary cause is the **integer overflow**, not just a lack of validation.\n*   CWE-415 (Double Free): This is not relevant to the vulnerability description.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity, with CWE-190 being the root cause and CWE-120 being the resulting buffer overflow. The relationships between these CWEs clarify the progression of the vulnerability.",
