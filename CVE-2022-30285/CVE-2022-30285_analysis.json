However, the description specifically mentions a **hash collision**, which aligns directly with the description of CWE-328. The other CWEs considered did not directly match the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n    cwe326[\"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    \n    cwe328 -->|CHILDOF| cwe326\n    cwe328 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe328 primary\n    class cwe326,cwe327 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a weak hash function**, leading to a **hash collision**, and ultimately resulting in the ability to **authenticate with invalid credentials**, thus bypassing authentication.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly indicates that **CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash)** is the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **hash collision** during authentication, which is the core characteristic of CWE-328.\n> In Quest KACE Systems Management Appliance (SMA) through 12.0, a **hash collision** is possible during authentication. This may allow authentication with invalid credentials.\n\nThis is further supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which identifies the root cause as a hash collision during authentication.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-328 as the top candidate.\nThe selection of CWE-328 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the use of a weak hash algorithm that is susceptible to collisions.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
