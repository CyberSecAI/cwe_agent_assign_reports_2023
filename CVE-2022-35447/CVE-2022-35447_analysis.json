CWE-122, a variant of CWE-787 specifically denotes a heap-based buffer overflow. CWE-119 is a class-level CWE that is more general and discouraged when more specific CWEs are available. The graph below shows the relationship:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe122 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **heap-buffer overflow** (CWE-787) caused by an **improper restriction of operations** within the bounds of a memory buffer (CWE-119). The specific type of overflow being on the heap makes CWE-122 a good secondary candidate. The final impact is a crash due to out-of-bounds write.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed towards CWE-787 due to the explicit mention of \"heap-buffer overflow\" in the vulnerability description. The \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section also listed CWE-787 as the primary match. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section provides further details about the vulnerability, confirming that it is a heap buffer overflow.\n\nThe retriever results listed CWE-119, CWE-190, CWE-122, CWE-125, CWE-126, CWE-121, CWE-128, CWE-476, CWE-193 and CWE-1284, among others.\n\nCWE-119 is a class-level CWE and is too general for this vulnerability. The mapping guidance for CWE-119 discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available.\n\nCWE-190, Integer Overflow or Wraparound, is not directly related to the vulnerability, as the root cause is a buffer overflow, not an integer overflow.\n\nCWE-122, Heap-based Buffer Overflow, is a variant of CWE-787 and is a more specific CWE. Since the vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow, CWE-122 is a good secondary candidate.\n\nCWE-125, Out-of-bounds Read, and CWE-126, Buffer Over-read, are not applicable, as the vulnerability is a buffer overflow (write), not a read.\n\nCWE-121, Stack-based Buffer Overflow, is not applicable, as the vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow, not a stack buffer overflow.\n\nCWE-128, Wrap-around Error, is not applicable, as the vulnerability is a buffer overflow, not a wrap-around error.\n\nCWE-476, NULL Pointer Dereference, is not applicable, as the vulnerability is a buffer overflow, not a null pointer dereference.\n\nCWE-193, Off-by-one Error, is not applicable, as the vulnerability is a buffer overflow, not an off-by-one error.\n\nCWE-1284, Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input, is not directly related to the vulnerability, as the root cause is a buffer overflow, not an improper validation of input.\n\nThe final decision is to assign CWE-787 as the primary CWE, as it is the most accurate and specific CWE for the vulnerability. CWE-122 is a secondary candidate because it specifies that the buffer overflow occurs on the heap.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n*   **CWE-787:** Out-of-bounds Write - This CWE describes a condition where the software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. The vulnerability description states that there is a **heap-buffer overflow**, which aligns with CWE-787.\n*   **CWE-122:** Heap-based Buffer Overflow - This CWE is a variant of CWE-787 and describes a buffer overflow that occurs on the heap. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the overflow is heap-based, making this a more specific classification.\n*   **CWE-119:** Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer - This CWE is a more general class of vulnerability that encompasses buffer overflows. While applicable, it is less specific than CWE-787 or CWE-122. The mapping guidance for CWE-119 discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available.",
