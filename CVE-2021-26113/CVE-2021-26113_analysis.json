This hierarchical relationship supports the selection of CWE-760 as the more specific and appropriate classification when a predictable salt is used. CWE-916 itself is a child of CWE-328 and CWE-327, indicating that it is related to the broader category of weak cryptographic practices.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe760[\"CWE-760: Use of a One-Way Hash with a Predictable Salt\"]\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of Insufficiently-Protected Key\"]\n\n    cwe760 -->|CHILDOF| cwe916\n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe328\n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe760 primary\n    class cwe916 secondary\n    class cwe328,cwe327 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a one-way hash with a predictable salt** [CWE-760]. This leads to a situation where an attacker in possession of the password file can potentially guess the stored passwords, resulting in information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly pointed towards CWE-760, supported by the vulnerability description. The retriever results also listed CWE-760 as the top candidate. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section explicitly mentions \"**use of a one-way hash with a predictable salt**\" as the root cause. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the \"**vulnerability stems from the use of a hardcoded, predictable salt during the password hashing process**\". This confirms that CWE-760 is the most accurate and specific classification. The confidence in this assessment is high due to the explicit mention of the weakness in both the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary.\n\nCWE-916 was considered as a broader classification, but CWE-760 is a variant of CWE-916 and describes the vulnerability more precisely, so it was selected as the primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-836: Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product records password hashes in a data store, receives a hash of a password from a client, and compares the supplied hash to the hash obtained from the data store.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
