It is related to CWE-522, which is a parent class that represents insufficiently protected credentials. The secondary CWE, CWE-201, is also a base-level weakness related to sending sensitive information. The relationships between these CWEs help to understand the context of the vulnerability and how it can be exploited.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe538[\"CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\"]\n\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe538 -->|PARENTOF| cwe532\n    cwe538 --o cwe256\n    cwe201 --o cwe256\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe201,cwe538 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insecure storage of the password in plain text**, which directly leads to the exposure of sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **insecure storage of password in plain text**. This is directly supported by the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary.\" The retriever results also list CWE-256 as the top candidate.\n\nThe final selection is based on the evidence provided, graph relationships, and the principle of selecting the most specific CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Similarity Score:** 5332.17\n**Source:** sparse\n\n**Description**:\nStoring a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n### How the Vulnerability Details Match the CWE Characteristics:\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states that the password was stored in plaintext in the database. This directly matches the description of CWE-256, which is \"Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.\"\n### Security Implications and Potential Impact:\nStoring passwords in plaintext allows anyone with access to the database to view and use the passwords, potentially leading to unauthorized access and data breaches.\n### Parent-Child Relationships or Chain Patterns:\nCWE-256 is a child of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials).\n### Whether the Weakness is Primary or Secondary in the Vulnerability:\nThis is the primary weakness.\n### How the Official MITRE Mapping Guidance Influenced Your Decision:\nThe mapping guidance for CWE-256 states that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level, and that the Usage is \"Allowed.\"\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Similarity Score**: 5.03\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n### How the Vulnerability Details Match the CWE Characteristics:\nWhile the primary issue is the plaintext storage, the exposure of the password in the database could be considered as insertion of sensitive information into sent data.\n### Security Implications and Potential Impact:\nExposure of sensitive information can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.\n### Parent-Child Relationships or Chain Patterns:\nCWE-201 is a child of CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information).\n### Whether the Weakness is Primary or Secondary in the Vulnerability:\nThis is a secondary weakness, as the primary issue is the plaintext storage itself.\n### How the Official MITRE Mapping Guidance Influenced Your Decision:\nThe mapping guidance for CWE-201 states that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level, and that the Usage is \"Allowed.\"\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n### How the Vulnerability Details Match the CWE Characteristics:\nThe vulnerability description states that the password was stored in plaintext in the database. This means the database, which is an externally accessible file, contained sensitive data.\n### Security Implications and Potential Impact:\nExposure of sensitive information can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.\n### Parent-Child Relationships or Chain Patterns:\nCWE-538 is a child of CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information).\n### Whether the Weakness is Primary or Secondary in the Vulnerability:\nThis is a secondary weakness, as the primary issue is the plaintext storage itself.\n### How the Official MITRE Mapping Guidance Influenced Your Decision:\nThe mapping guidance for CWE-538 states that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level, and that the Usage is \"Allowed.\"\n\n## Other CWEs Considered but Not Used:\n\n*   **CWE-1390 Weak Authentication:** This CWE is too high-level.
