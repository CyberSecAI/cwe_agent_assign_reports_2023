## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **weakness** in the password recovery mechanism (CWE-640), which leads to an **authentication bypass** (CWE-288), ultimately allowing an unauthenticated user to reset passwords and gain access to any local account. The root cause is the **improper implementation** of the password reset process.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment pointed to CWE-640 as the primary weakness, given the explicit mention of a flaw in the password recovery mechanism. The vulnerability description highlights an **authentication bypass** in the "forgotpasswordstep1" component. The retriever results also listed CWE-640 as the top combined result. The analysis considered other related CWEs, such as CWE-287, CWE-1390, and CWE-306, but these were deemed less specific than CWE-640.

The relationship graph shows that CWE-640 is a child of CWE-1390, which in turn is a child of CWE-287. This indicates a hierarchical relationship where CWE-640 is the most specific representation of the vulnerability.

The selection of CWE-640 is based on the following evidence: "An **authentication bypass** in ECM/maintenance/forgotpasswordstep1 allows an unauthenticated user to reset passwords and login as any local account." This statement directly supports the classification of CWE-640.

CWE-288 is included as a secondary weakness because the ability to reset passwords without proper authentication implies the existence of an alternate path that bypasses the normal authentication process.

Other CWEs considered but not used:

*   CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key - While the vulnerability allows unauthorized access, it's more directly related to the password reset process than a general authorization bypass.
*   CWE-287: Improper Authentication - This is a broader category, and CWE-640 provides a more specific description of the vulnerability.
*   CWE-1390: Weak Authentication - Similar to CWE-287, this is a broader category that encompasses various authentication weaknesses.
*   CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function - While authentication is missing for the password reset, CWE-640 more accurately describes the specific **weakness** in the recovery mechanism.
*   CWE-620: Unverified Password Change - Similar to CWE-640, but less focused on the recovery *mechanism*.
*   CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials - There's no evidence of hard-coded credentials being used in this vulnerability.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the identified **weakness** in the password recovery mechanism and the resulting **authentication bypass**.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content describes vulnerabilities in Saviynt Enterprise Identity Cloud, specifically related to user enumeration and authentication bypass. However, this content is associated with **VU#692873**, not CVE-2022-23855. Therefore, it is **UNRELATED** to the specified CVE.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities described in the provided content (VU#692873):

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The local password reset feature in Saviynt Enterprise Identity Cloud has two vulnerabilities.
  - User enumeration is possible by specifying the `id` parameter in a specific URL, revealing usernames.
  - The password reset process can be bypassed, allowing an attacker to change a user's password without proper authorization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **User Enumeration:** The `id` parameter in the `/ECM/maintenance/forgotpasswordstep1` URL allows attackers to discover usernames by iterating through ID values.
- **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can bypass the password reset verification and change a user's password by manipulating the password reset flow (either unhiding a button or directly accessing a URL).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can enumerate users and change the password of an existing administrative user.
- This grants the attacker administrative access to the Saviynt Enterprise Identity Cloud instance.
- The attacker could then perform administrative actions and potentially compromise other connected authentication systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed over the network via HTTP requests.
- Attackers can directly access specific URLs to exploit the password reset process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Saviynt Enterprise Identity Cloud instance.
- No prior authentication is required to exploit the user enumeration and password reset bypass vulnerabilities.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-640: Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product contains a mechanism for users to recover or change their passwords without knowing the original password, but the mechanism is weak.

### Extended Description


It is common for an application to have a mechanism that provides a means for a user to gain access to their account in the event they forget their password. Very often the password recovery mechanism is weak, which has the effect of making it more likely that it would be possible for a person other than the legitimate system user to gain access to that user's account. Weak password recovery schemes completely undermine a strong password authentication scheme.


This weakness may be that the security question is too easy to guess or find an answer to (e.g. because the question is too common, or the answers can be found using social media). Or there might be an implementation weakness in the password recovery mechanism code that may for instance trick the system into e-mailing the new password to an e-mail account other than that of the user. There might be no throttling done on the rate of password resets so that a legitimate user can be denied service by an attacker if an attacker tries to recover their password in a rapid succession. The system may send the original password to the user rather than generating a new temporary password. In summary, password recovery functionality, if not carefully designed and implemented can often become the system's weakest link that can be misused in a way that would allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1390
ChildOf -> CWE-287

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This entry appears to be frequently misused for any weakness related to password changes, even though the name focuses on "Password Recovery" for a "forgotten" password.
**Comments:** CWE-640 should only be used when there is a "password recovery" mechanism for forgotten passwords. Consider password-related entries under CWE-1390: Weak Authentication.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry might be reclassified as a category or "loose composite," since it lists multiple specific errors that can make the mechanism weak. However, under view 1000, it could be a weakness under protection mechanism failure, although it is different from most PMF issues since it is related to a feature that is designed to bypass a protection mechanism (specifically, the lack of knowledge of a password).

**[Maintenance]** This entry probably needs to be split; see extended description.






## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

### Extended Description


Retrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.


For example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.


One manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.


### Alternative Terms
Insecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The "Insecure Direct Object Reference" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.
Broken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.
Horizontal Authorization: "Horizontal Authorization" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-863
ChildOf -> CWE-863
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-36539:** An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.




## CWE-287: Improper Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
authentification: An alternate term is "authentification", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.
AuthN: "AuthN" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authentication" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from "AuthZ," which is an abbreviation of "authorization." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.
AuthC: "AuthC" is used as an abbreviation of "authentication," but it appears to used less frequently than "AuthN."

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions.

- **CVE-1999-1454:** Attackers with physical access to the machine may bypass the password prompt by pressing the ESC (Escape) key.
- **CVE-1999-1077:** OS allows local attackers to bypass the password protection of idled sessions via the programmer's switch or CMD-PWR keyboard sequence, which brings up a debugger that the attacker can use to disable the lock.




## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

### Extended Description


There are two main variations:


  - Inbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks the input credentials against a hard-coded set of credentials. In this variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. It can also be difficult for the administrator to detect.

  - Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component. This variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password that can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product.
