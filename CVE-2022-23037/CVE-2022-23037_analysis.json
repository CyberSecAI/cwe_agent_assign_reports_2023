CWE-367 is a child of CWE-362, a more general class. The relationship influenced the decision to choose the more specific CWE-367 while also acknowledging CWE-362 as a related, broader classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    \n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe367 primary\n    class cwe362 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with the **race condition** that stems from testing a grant reference and then attempting to remove the granted access. The **time of check time of use (TOCTOU)** leads to the backend potentially retaining access to guest memory pages. This can then result in data leaks, data corruption, and denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section which explicitly mentions \"**race condition**\" and \"**time of check time of use (TOCTOU)**\". Additionally, the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" details the sequence of events that constitutes the vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-367 is based on its direct relevance to the vulnerability description. The weakness is in the timing between checking the state of a resource and using that resource, allowing for an exploitable window. CWE-367 captures this scenario precisely.\n\nCWE-362 was considered but ultimately deemed too general. While the vulnerability does involve concurrent execution and improper synchronization, CWE-367 provides a more specific and accurate characterization of the underlying issue which is the **TOCTOU**.\n\nThe choice of CWE-367 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it accurately reflects the vulnerability's root cause and aligns with the evidence provided.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
