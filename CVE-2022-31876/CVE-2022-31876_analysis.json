It is related to CWE-284 Improper Access Control, as forced browsing is a type of access control bypass. CWE-425 is a child of CWE-862 Missing Authorization, CWE-288 Authorization Bypass Through Alternate Channel, and CWE-424 Improper Access Control. This hierarchical relationship indicates that CWE-425 is a more specific form of access control issue than CWE-284.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authorization Bypass Through Alternate Channel\"]\n    cwe424[\"CWE-424: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe288\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe424\n    cwe425 -->|PARENT| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe425 primary\n    class cwe284,cwe862,cwe288,cwe424 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect access control** in `/recreate.php`. This allows an attacker to directly request the resource, bypassing intended authorization mechanisms. The impact is that all users' cookies can be leaked.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **incorrect access control** as the root cause. The retriever results and graph relationships helped refine the selection to a more specific CWE.\n\nThe vulnerability description states that the Netgear WNAP320 router is vulnerable to **incorrect access control** via `/recreate.php`, which can leak all users' cookies. The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** section confirms the root cause as **incorrect access control**.\n\nThe retriever results list several potential CWEs. CWE-425 Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') has a high score and aligns well with the vulnerability description, where a user can directly access `/recreate.php` without proper authorization.\n\nCWE-284 Improper Access Control is a high-level pillar that is generally discouraged, while CWE-425 is a more specific Base level CWE that better describes the vulnerability.\n\nTherefore, CWE-425 is the most appropriate CWE because it accurately describes the vulnerability where an attacker can directly request a restricted resource due to **improper access control**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-300: Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not adequately verify the identity of actors at both ends of a communication channel, or does not adequately ensure the integrity of the channel, in a way that allows the channel to be accessed or influenced by an actor that is not an endpoint.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-300 is commonly misused for vulnerabilities in which the prerequisites for exploitation require the adversary to be in a privileged \"in-the-middle\" position.\n\n\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
