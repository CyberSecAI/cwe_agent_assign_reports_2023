CWE-401 is a variant of these more general classes, indicating that the memory resource is not released after its intended use.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\"]\n    cwe772[\"CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    \n    cwe401 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    cwe401 -->|CHILDOF| cwe772\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe401 primary\n    class cwe404,cwe772 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **lack of proper memory management**, leading to a missing release of memory, which ultimately causes the application to crash.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the description of a \"**lack of proper memory management**\" leading to a crash, points towards issues with resource handling.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"Due to **lack of proper memory management**, when a victim opens manipulated Right Hemisphere Material (.rhm, rh.x3d) file received from untrusted sources in SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Author - version 9, it is possible for the application to crash\".\n\nGiven the description and the retriever results, CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) is the most appropriate. The description explicitly mentions a **lack of proper memory management**, and the crash is consistent with the consequences of a memory leak.\n\nCWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) and CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) were considered but deemed less appropriate because the description doesn't explicitly mention buffer overflows or out-of-bounds writes. While these could be related, the primary issue appears to be a failure to release memory, which aligns directly with CWE-401.\n\nCWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) was also considered, but the provided description does not specify that the memory allocation size is untrusted.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-401 is based on the direct evidence of a **lack of proper memory management** leading to a crash, which aligns well with the description of a missing memory release. The decision is further supported by the MITRE mapping guidance, which allows CWE-401 and designates it as a Variant level, which is a preferred level.",
