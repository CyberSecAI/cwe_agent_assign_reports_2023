While CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information) is a higher-level Class, it's discouraged as it represents an impact rather than the root cause. The relationship between CWE-525 and its parent CWE-524 helps to understand that the core issue is related to improper handling of caching mechanisms.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe525[\"CWE-525: Use of Web Browser Cache Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe524[\"CWE-524: Missing Cache-Control Header\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe525 -->|CHILDOF| cwe524\n    cwe525 -->|IMPACT| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe525 primary\n    class cwe524 secondary\n    class cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with the **inadequate cache control** (**WEAKNESS**) in the Sylius application, leading to the browser caching sensitive pages. This allows for **exposure of cached data** (**WEAKNESS**) which is then accessible through the browser back button. The final impact is **sensitive information disclosure** (**IMPACT**) to an unauthorized actor.\n  - **Root Cause:** Inadequate cache control (CWE-525)\n  - **Weakness:** Exposure of cached data\n  - **Impact:** Sensitive information disclosure (CWE-200)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability description points to an information exposure issue due to improper caching. The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** confirms this by highlighting the **root cause** as \"**inadequate cache control**\" and \"**lack of proper redirect after logout**\". The suggested fix further reinforces this by mentioning the implementation of stricter cache policies using HTTP headers.\n\nThe Retriever results also support this assessment, with CWE-525 (Use of Web Browser Cache Containing Sensitive Information) being the top match. Although CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is also present, it is discouraged by MITRE as it often represents an impact rather than the **root cause**.\n\nTherefore, the primary CWE is selected as CWE-525 because it directly addresses the **weakness** related to improper caching mechanisms. This is further supported by the fact that the application **does not properly instruct the browser to avoid caching sensitive pages, particularly after a user has logged out.** The suggested mitigations involve implementing stricter cache policies, which directly addresses the improper caching issue described in CWE-525.\n\nCWE-200 was considered but rejected as the primary CWE due to its high-level nature and the availability of a more specific CWE (CWE-525) that directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity (Variant) as it directly describes the improper use of web browser cache containing sensitive information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
