The AJAX action does not validate the nonce. |\n| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 1.0 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary CWE. The AJAX action `wpmemory_install_plugin` can be accessed by any authenticated user. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **missing authorization and CSRF check**. CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] is a compound weakness that requires a lack of verification that a request was intentionally sent by the user. CWE-862 [Missing Authorization] is a class-level weakness describing a product's failure to perform an authorization check. CWE-862 is a child of CWE-285 [Improper Authorization].\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe352\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n    class cwe285 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization and CSRF check** in the AJAX action, which allows any authenticated user to call it and install and activate arbitrary plugins from wordpress.org. The lack of proper authorization (CWE-862) and CSRF protection (CWE-352) leads to the ability to install arbitrary plugins, which can have further impacts such as installing backdoors or malware, modifying site content, or gaining administrative access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is caused by the **missing authorization and CSRF check** in an AJAX action of the WordPress plugin. The vulnerability description clearly states that the plugin before version 2.46 does not have proper authorisation and CSRF in an AJAX action, allowing any authenticated users to call it and install and activate arbitrary plugins. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating: \"The WP Memory plugin has an AJAX action that lacks proper authorization and CSRF protection.\"\n\nThe Retriever Results also support this analysis, with CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] and CWE-862 [Missing Authorization] being the top matches.\n\nCWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] is selected as the primary CWE because the AJAX action does not validate the nonce, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks. CWE-862 [Missing Authorization] is selected as a secondary CWE because the AJAX action can be accessed by any authenticated user, including those with subscriber-level privileges.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but not chosen because they did not accurately reflect the root cause of the vulnerability. For example, CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization] was considered, but the vulnerability involves a **missing authorization check** rather than an incorrect one.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
