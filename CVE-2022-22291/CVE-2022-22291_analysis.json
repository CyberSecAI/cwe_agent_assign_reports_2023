While CWE-779 is a child of CWE-400, the \"Logging of Excessive Data\" is not about the resource consumption, but rather the exposure of the logged data. Therefore, it is more accurate to select CWE-779. The peer relationship to CWE-1295 (Debug Messages Revealing Unnecessary Information) was considered, but the **logging of excessive data** in this instance is not specifically debug messages.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe779[\"CWE-779: Logging of Excessive Data\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe779 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe779 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **logging of excessive data**, which leads to the exposure of Cell Location Information to privileged attackers.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description clearly states that the \"**logging of excessive data**\" is the root cause. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section confirms this, stating \"root_cause: Logging of excessive data vulnerability in telephony\" and \"weaknesses: [Logging of excessive data]\".\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the parent-child relationship between CWE-779 and CWE-400. However, the focus on data exposure rather than resource consumption led to the selection of CWE-779.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **logging of excessive data**, which is the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
