While other CWEs like **CWE-550** (Server-generated Error Message Containing Sensitive Information) and **CWE-497** (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere) were considered due to their relevance to information exposure, **CWE-201** best captures the **root cause**, which is the **insertion** of sensitive build and service versions into the server response header. The relationships like *CanAlsoBe* for **CWE-201** with **CWE-202** (Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries) were reviewed but deemed less specific than the direct data insertion aspect.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe202[\"CWE-202: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries\"]\n\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe201 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe209\n    cwe201 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe202\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe202,cwe209 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively straightforward:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** Inclusion of sensitive version information in the server response.\n2.  **Weakness:** **Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data (CWE-201)**.\n3.  **Impact:** Disclosure of build and services versions to potential attackers, aiding in identifying and exploiting known vulnerabilities.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided vulnerability description and the corresponding \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\". The evidence explicitly states that the \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the server's response headers disclosing build and service versions.\" This directly aligns with **CWE-201** (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data), where the server is transmitting data (response headers) containing sensitive information (build and service versions) to another actor (client/attacker).\n\nThe retriever results further support this, with **CWE-201** being ranked highest. The relationship graph reinforces that **CWE-201** is a child of **CWE-200** (Exposure of Sensitive Information), which is a broader category. However, **CWE-201** is more specific because it identifies the mechanism: **insertion of the sensitive information**.\n\nThe decision to select **CWE-201** is based on its direct match to the vulnerability's root cause and mechanism, aligning with MITRE's mapping guidance for selecting the most specific and relevant CWE.\n\n**CWE-550** (Server-generated Error Message Containing Sensitive Information) and **CWE-497** (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere) were considered, but the vulnerability is not specifically related to error messages (as in **CWE-550**) nor does it expose system-level information beyond the software versions (as required by **CWE-497**). Therefore, **CWE-201** is the optimal choice.",
