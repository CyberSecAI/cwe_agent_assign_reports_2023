# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2022-34206

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 1.0 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-352 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | 0.7 | Compound | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the decision is the ChildOf relationship between CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and its parent CWE-285 (Improper Authorization). Although CWE-285 encompasses both missing and incorrect authorization, CWE-862 is more specific, directly addressing the **missing permission check**. The Retriever Results also indicated CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), a peer of CWE-862, but the vulnerability description explicitly states a **missing permission check**, making CWE-862 a more accurate fit. The secondary CWE, CWE-352, is a compound weakness that requires a **missing permission check** and is not directly part of the child-parent relationship of the primary weakness.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **missing permission check** (CWE-862). This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to send HTTP POST requests to an attacker-specified URL. The chain can then lead to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CWE-352), because the form validation method does not require POST requests.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided evidence, which includes the vulnerability description and CVE reference links. The vulnerability description key phrases clearly indicate a **missing permission check**, making CWE-862 the most relevant primary CWE. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section explicitly mentions "Missing permission check" as a weakness and confirms that attackers can send HTTP POST requests to an attacker-specified URL due to this missing check. The retriever results also point to CWE-862 as the top candidate. The other highly ranked CWEs in the retriever results, such as CWE-863 and CWE-285, are related to authorization issues but are less specific than CWE-862.

The selection of CWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately captures the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **missing permission check**. While CWE-285 is a parent class, CWE-862 provides a more precise description of the flaw.

The evidence supporting the selection of CWE-862 is: "A **missing permission check** in Jenkins Jianliao Notification Plugin 1.1 and earlier allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to send HTTP POST requests to an attacker-specified URL."

The secondary CWE, CWE-352 is mentioned as the form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability."

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. This is often a component in phishing attacks.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 4944.
