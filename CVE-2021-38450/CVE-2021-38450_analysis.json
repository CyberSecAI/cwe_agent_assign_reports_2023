This indicates that code injection is a specific type of injection vulnerability involving the construction of code segments. CWE-138 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements) is a broader class that encompasses various types of special element handling issues, but CWE-94 is more specific to code.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\"]\n    cwe138[\"CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\"]\n\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    cwe138 -->|PARENTOF|cwe150\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe913, cwe138 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper sanitization of input containing code syntax** (root cause). This leads to the ability to inject code and **alter the intended controller flow of the software** (impact).\n  - Root Cause: **Improper sanitization of input containing code syntax**\n  - Weakness: CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\n  - Impact: Alter the intended controller flow of the software\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary, points towards CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')) as the primary weakness. The description states that the affected controllers **do not properly sanitize the input containing code syntax**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the vulnerability is a code injection issue stemming from improper sanitization of user inputs containing code syntax.\n\nThe retriever results also support this assessment, with CWE-94 listed as a candidate, although the highest rated one was CWE-138.\n\nCWE-94 is selected because it directly addresses the **improper control of code generation** due to **lack of sanitization**. The relationship analysis highlights that CWE-94 is a specific type of injection vulnerability. The evidence strongly supports this classification.\n\nWhile CWE-138 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements) is a related weakness, it is a broader category. Since the vulnerability specifically involves code injection, CWE-94 is the more precise and appropriate choice.\n\nThe selection of CWE-94 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly reflects the root cause of the vulnerability - the **improper control of generation of code** due to **lack of sanitization**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-838: Inappropriate Encoding for Output Context\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses or specifies an encoding when generating output to a downstream component, but the specified encoding is not the same as the encoding that is expected by the downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
