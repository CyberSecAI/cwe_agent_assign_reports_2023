CWE-130 can precede CWE-787. The selection of CWE-787 is based on the **improper buffer restrictions** described in the vulnerability, which directly points to an out-of-bounds write situation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe130[\"CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe130 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe130 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper buffer restrictions**, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds write, which causes a denial of service.\n  - Root Cause: **Improper buffer restrictions**\n  - Weakness: Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)\n  - Impact: Denial of Service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed towards **improper buffer restrictions** leading to a denial of service. The core of the vulnerability lies in how the buffer restrictions are mishandled, which is strongly indicative of an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). While CWE-119 is a broader category, CWE-787 offers a more specific classification.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions **improper buffer restrictions** as the root cause. This directly supports the selection of CWE-787. \"Improper buffer restrictions in firmware...may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by emphasizing the hierarchical structure where CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119, indicating a more specialized form of buffer issue.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an optimal level of specificity because CWE-787 directly addresses the **improper buffer restrictions** leading to an out-of-bounds write, while CWE-119 serves as a broader, less specific category. The relationship between CWE-130 and CWE-787 indicates that an improper length parameter could potentially lead to the out-of-bounds write, adding more context to the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is too high-level and does not directly relate to the buffer restrictions.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: While related to buffer issues, the description focuses on the calculation of buffer size rather than the restrictions themselves.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is not relevant as it deals with input validation of resource identifiers, which is not the primary issue here.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n*Not Selected*: Privilege handling is not the focus of the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. However, classification research is limited for weaknesses of this type, so there can be gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE that force use of this weakness, even at such a high level of abstraction.\n\n*Not Selected*: Too high-level and does not directly relate to buffer restrictions.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names.
