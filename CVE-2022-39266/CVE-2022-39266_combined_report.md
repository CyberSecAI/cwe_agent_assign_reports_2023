## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events is as follows:
1.  The application receives untrusted v8 cached data.
2.  Due to **improper input validation (CWE-20)**, the application processes the untrusted data.
3.  The untrusted data leads to **deserialization of untrusted data (CWE-502)**.
4.  The deserialization bypasses the sandbox, leading to arbitrary code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
Initially, the analysis focused on the **improper input validation** described in the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" section and the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section, which states: "The vulnerability stems from the usage of untrusted v8 cached data through the `CachedDataOptions` API, which allows for the execution of arbitrary code." The description indicates the **rootcause** is a failure to validate untrusted data, which led to the selection of CWE-20 **Improper Input Validation**.

The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section also mentions "Improper Authentication (CWE-287)" and "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (CWE-693)", but those appear to be less accurate descriptions of the weakness being described.

The retriever results also list several relevant CWEs including CWE-20, CWE-502, CWE-863, and CWE-1336.

CWE-20 **Improper Input Validation** is selected as the primary CWE because it is the most direct representation of the **rootcause**. However, CWE-20 is a Class-level CWE and is "Discouraged" for use. It can be used in this case because there are no more specific Base or Variant level CWEs that are appropriate.

CWE-502 **Deserialization of Untrusted Data** is selected as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability involves processing v8 cached data, which could be interpreted as deserialization.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity given the available information.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed

This CWE was considered, but it doesn't precisely fit because the problem isn't about equivalence but about validating the structure and content of the cached data.

## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed

This CWE relates to the sandbox bypass but does not directly address the **rootcause** of the vulnerability, which is the **improper handling of untrusted data**.

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review

This CWE does not apply because the issue is not about resource release.

## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged

While this could be related to the structure of the v8 cached data, it is less specific than CWE-20 or CWE-502.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged

This CWE is related to injection, which is a potential consequence, but not the **rootcause** of the vulnerability.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed

This is somewhat relevant, but CWE-20 and CWE-502 more directly address the **rootcause**.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed

This CWE is not applicable because the issue isn't about an incomplete list of disallowed inputs.

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed

This CWE does not apply because the issue is not related to the reuse of resources.

## CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component that specifies multiple attributes, properties, or fields that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control which attributes can be modified.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed

This is a possibility, but less likely than CWE-502 since the vulnerability description doesn't focus on object attribute modification specifically.

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged

While related to trust, this is less specific than CWE-20 or CWE-502.

## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine
**Abstraction Level

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.

### Extended Description


Attackers might be able to spoof the intended endpoint from a different system or process, thus gaining the same level of access as the intended endpoint.


While this issue frequently involves authentication between network-based clients and servers, other types of communication channels and endpoints can have this weakness.

- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product receives input or data, but it does
        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the
        properties that are required to process the data safely and
        correctly.

### Extended Description


Input validation is a frequently-used technique for checking potentially dangerous inputs in order to ensure that the inputs are safe for processing within the code, or when communicating with other components. When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.


Input validation is not the only technique for processing input, however. Other techniques attempt to transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well (see CWE-138 for more examples.)


Input validation can be applied to:


  - raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.

  - metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size

Data can be simple or structured. Structured data can be composed of many nested layers, composed of combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or structured data.

Many properties of raw data or metadata may need to be validated upon entry into the code, such as:


  - specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.

  - implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size

  - indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures

  - symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.

  - well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax 

  - lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token

  - specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)

  - consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.

  - conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic 

  - equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same

  - authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data

Implied or derived properties of data must often be calculated or inferred by the code itself. Errors in deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor to improper input validation. 

Note that "input validation" has very different meanings to different people, or within different classification schemes. Caution must be used when referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it. For example, some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control to an attacker over an input when they should not be able to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred to as input validation.


Finally, it is important to emphasize that the distinctions between input validation and output escaping are often blurred, and developers must be careful to understand the difference, including how input validation is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a query. The name "O'Reilly" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, this valid name cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the "'" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis. It is also a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Consider lower-level children such as Improper Use of Validation Framework (CWE-1173) or improper validation involving specific types or properties of input such as Specified Quantity (CWE-1284); Specified Index, Position, or Offset (CWE-1285); Syntactic Correctness (CWE-1286); Specified Type (CWE-1287); Consistency within Input (CWE-1288); or Unsafe Equivalence (CWE-1289).
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-1284: Specified Quantity
- CWE-1285: Specified Index, Position, or Offset
- CWE-1286: Syntactic Correctness
- CWE-1287: Specified Type
- CWE-1288: Consistency within Input
- CWE-1289: Unsafe Equivalence
- CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

CWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.


**[Maintenance]** As of 2020, this entry is used more often than preferred, and it is a source of frequent confusion. It is being actively modified for CWE 4.1 and subsequent versions.

**[Maintenance]** Concepts such as validation, data transformation, and neutralization are being refined, so relationships between CWE-20 and other entries such as CWE-707 may change in future versions, along with an update to the Vulnerability Theory document.

**[Maintenance]** Input validation - whether missing or incorrect - is such an essential and widespread part of secure development that it is implicit in many different weaknesses. Traditionally, problems such as buffer overflows and XSS have been classified as input validation problems by many security professionals. However, input validation is not necessarily the only protection mechanism available for avoiding such problems, and in some cases it is not even sufficient. The CWE team has begun capturing these subtleties in chains within the Research Concepts view (CWE-1000), but more work is needed.

**[Terminology]** 

The "input validation" term is extremely common, but it is used in many different ways. In some cases its usage can obscure the real underlying weakness or otherwise hide chaining and composite relationships.


Some people use "input validation" as a general term that covers many different neutralization techniques for ensuring that input is appropriate, such as filtering, canonicalization, and escaping. Others use the term in a more narrow context to simply mean "checking if an input conforms to expectations without changing it." CWE uses this more narrow interpretation.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)
- **CVE-2021-30860:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) leads to integer overflow (CWE-190) in mobile OS, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses an externally controlled name or reference that resolves to a resource that is outside of the intended control sphere.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-664

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is a general class of weakness, but most research is focused on more specialized cases, such as path traversal (CWE-22) and symlink following (CWE-61). A symbolic link has a name; in general, it appears like any other file in the file system. However, the link includes a reference to another file, often in another directory - perhaps in another sphere of control. Many common library functions that accept filenames will "follow" a symbolic link and use the link's target instead.

**[Maintenance]** The relationship between CWE-99 and CWE-610 needs further investigation and clarification. They might be duplicates. CWE-99 "Resource Injection," as originally defined in Seven Pernicious Kingdoms taxonomy, emphasizes the "identifier used to access a system resource" such as a file name or port number, yet it explicitly states that the "resource injection" term does not apply to "path manipulation," which effectively identifies the path at which a resource can be found and could be considered to be one aspect of a resource identifier. Also, CWE-610 effectively covers any type of resource, whether that resource is at the system layer, the application layer, or the code layer.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-3032:** An email client does not block loading of remote objects in a nested document.
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)
- **CVE-2018-1000613:** Cryptography API uses unsafe reflection when deserializing a private key




## CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-345
ChildOf -> CWE-345

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-1796:** Does not properly verify signatures for "trusted" entities.
- **CVE-2005-2181:** Insufficient verification allows spoofing.
- **CVE-2005-2182:** Insufficient verification allows spoofing.




## CWE-1274: Improper Access Control for Volatile Memory Containing Boot Code
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product conducts a secure-boot process that transfers bootloader code from Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) into Volatile Memory (VM), but it does not have sufficient access control or other protections for the Volatile Memory.

### Extended Description


Adversaries could bypass the secure-boot process and execute their own untrusted, malicious boot code.


As a part of a secure-boot process, the read-only-memory (ROM) code for a System-on-Chip (SoC) or other system fetches bootloader code from Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) and stores the code in Volatile Memory (VM), such as dynamic, random-access memory (DRAM) or static, random-access memory (SRAM). The NVM is usually external to the SoC, while the VM is internal to the SoC. As the code is transferred from NVM to VM, it is authenticated by the SoC's ROM code.


If the volatile-memory-region protections or access controls are insufficient to prevent modifications from an adversary or untrusted agent, the secure boot may be bypassed or replaced with the execution of an adversary's code.


### Alternative Terms

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-2267:** Locked memory regions may be modified through other interfaces in a secure-boot-loader image due to improper access control.




## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.

### Extended Description


Code frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.


### Alternative Terms

**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).

**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. "Resource exhaustion" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..
- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.




## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.

### Extended Description


Many web applications use template engines that allow developers to insert externally-influenced values into free text or messages in order to generate a full web page, document, message, etc. Such engines include Twig, Jinja2, Pug, Java Server Pages, FreeMarker, Velocity, ColdFusion, Smarty, and many others - including PHP itself. Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.


Template engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression "{{7*7}}" and determine if the output returns "49" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.


In some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.


Template engines can be used on the server or client, so both "sides" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.


### Alternative Terms
Server-Side Template Injection / SSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a server.
Client-Side Template Injection / CSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a client.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-94

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Since expression languages are often used in templating languages, there may be some overlap with CWE-917 (Expression Language Injection). XSS (CWE-79) is also co-located with template injection.

**[Maintenance]** The interrelationships and differences between CWE-917 and CWE-1336 need to be further clarified.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-34359:** Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a "prompt injection" attack.
- **CVE-2017-16783:** server-side template injection in content management server
- **CVE-2020-9437:** authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection




## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

### Extended Description
Most languages and protocols have their own special elements such as characters and reserved words. These special elements can carry control implications. If product does not prevent external control or influence over the inclusion of such special elements, the control flow of the program may be altered from what was intended. For example, both Unix and Windows interpret the symbol < ("less than") as meaning "read input from a file".

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-707

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness can be related to interpretation conflicts or interaction errors in intermediaries (such as proxies or application firewalls) when the intermediary's model of an endpoint does not account for protocol-specific special elements.

**[Relationship]** See this entry's children for different types of special elements that have been observed at one point or another. However, it can be difficult to find suitable CVE examples. In an attempt to be complete, CWE includes some types that do not have any associated observed example.

**[Research Gap]** This weakness is probably under-studied for proprietary or custom formats. It is likely that these issues are fairly common in applications that use their own custom format for configuration files, logs, meta-data, messaging, etc. They would only be found by accident or with a focused effort based on an understanding of the format.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-0677:** Read arbitrary files from mail client by providing a special MIME header that is internally used to store pathnames for attachments.
- **CVE-2000-0703:** Setuid program does not cleanse special escape sequence before sending data to a mail program, causing the mail program to process those sequences.
- **CVE-2003-0020:** Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.




## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Marshaling, Unmarshaling: Marshaling and unmarshaling are effectively synonyms for serialization and deserialization, respectively.
Pickling, Unpickling: In Python, the "pickle" functionality is used to perform serialization and deserialization.
PHP Object Injection: Some PHP application researchers use this term when attacking unsafe use of the unserialize() function; but it is also used for CWE-915.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-913
ChildOf -> CWE-913
PeerOf -> CWE-915

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between CWE-502 and CWE-915 need further exploration. CWE-915 is more narrowly scoped to object modification, and is not necessarily used for deserialization.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-12799:** chain: bypass of untrusted deserialization issue (CWE-502) by using an assumed-trusted class (CWE-183)
- **CVE-2015-8103:** Deserialization issue in commonly-used Java library allows remote execution.
- **CVE-2015-4852:** Deserialization issue in commonly-used Java library allows remote execution.
