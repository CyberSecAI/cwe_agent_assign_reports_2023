| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 1 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), which is a Class-level CWE. The analysis considered the parent-child relationships. While CWE-862 is a Class, the description clearly indicates the root cause is a **missing permission check**, which directly corresponds to the definition of Missing Authorization.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is straightforward: a **missing permission check** (CWE-862) leads to remote information disclosure.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly states a "**missing permission check**". This directly aligns with CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).

The vulnerability description includes the key phrase "**missing permission check**," indicating a failure to perform authorization. The impact is remote information disclosure, which is a consequence of the **missing permission check**. The evidence is strong, leading to a high confidence score.

CWE-862 is selected because the **root cause** is a **missing authorization check**. While it's a Class-level CWE, there are no more specific children that directly address the "missing" aspect of the authorization failure.
