CWE-287 **Improper Authentication** is a parent of both. The abstraction level was also considered, favoring the more specific Base level of CWE-305 over the Class levels of CWE-1390 and CWE-287.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe305[\"CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe305 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe1390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe305 primary\n    class cwe1390,cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause**: a user row not being bound to a specific authentication mechanism. This leads to the **weakness**: an **authentication bypass**. The final **impact** is a potential account takeover under specific circumstances.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified a potential authentication bypass in Joomla due to a user row not being bound to a specific authentication mechanism, potentially leading to account takeover. The evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states: \"Root cause of vulnerability: A user row in Joomla was not bound to a specific authentication mechanism\" and \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Incorrect Access Control\".\n\nThe Retriever Results suggested CWE-287 **Improper Authentication**, CWE-620 **Unverified Password Change**, CWE-338 **Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)**, CWE-1390 **Weak Authentication**, and CWE-306 **Missing Authentication for Critical Function**. However, based on the description and evidence provided, CWE-305 **Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness** is the most appropriate, as the **authentication mechanism** itself isn't inherently flawed, but a separate **weakness** (the lack of binding) allows for a bypass.\n\nCWE-1390 **Weak Authentication** is considered as a related Class, and CWE-287 **Improper Authentication** is the parent Class of CWE-1390.\n\nThe final decision prioritizes CWE-305 because it most accurately reflects the root cause: \"The authentication algorithm is sound, but the implemented mechanism can be bypassed as the result of a separate **weakness** that is primary to the authentication error.\" This is a more precise characterization of the vulnerability than simply stating that authentication is missing or improper. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-305 being a Base level CWE providing more detail than the Class level CWEs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe **authentication** algorithm is sound, but the implemented mechanism can be **bypassed** as the result of a separate **weakness** that is primary to the **authentication** error.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Most \"**authentication bypass**\" errors are resultant, not primary.\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-1374:** The provided password is only compared against the first character of the real password.\n- **CVE-2000-0979:** The password is not properly checked, which allows remote attackers to bypass access controls by sending a 1-byte password that matches the first character of the real password.\n- **CVE-2001-0088:** Chain: Forum software does not properly initialize an array, which inadvertently sets the password to a single character, allowing remote attackers to easily guess the password and gain administrative privileges.\n\n**CWE-287 Improper Authentication:** Considered but not selected as it is too general. The vulnerability is not merely an improper authentication, but a bypass due to a specific flaw. The mapping guidance discourages using CWE-287 when more specific entries exist.\n\n**CWE-620 Unverified Password Change:** Considered but not selected as it specifically relates to password changes without verification, which is not the primary issue described in the vulnerability.\n\n**CWE-338 Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG):** Considered but not selected as it involves weak PRNGs, which is unrelated to the described vulnerability.\n\n**CWE-1390 Weak Authentication:** Considered as a secondary CWE because it encompasses the general idea of a **weakness** in the **authentication** process. However, CWE-305 provides a more precise description of how the **authentication** is bypassed.\n\n**CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function:** Considered but not selected as it describes a complete lack of **authentication**, whereas the Joomla vulnerability involves a bypass of the existing **authentication** mechanism.",
