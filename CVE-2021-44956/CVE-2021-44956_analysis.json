CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), which in turn is a child of CWE-119. The evidence strongly points to a heap-based buffer overflow, thus justifying the selection of the more specific CWE-122 over the more general CWE-119.

The mapping guidance for CWE-119 discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but deemed less relevant. CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) and CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error) were considered but the root cause is a buffer overflow, not an integer issue. CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is a possible consequence of the overflow, but CWE-122 better represents the actual vulnerability. CWE-129 (Improper Validation of Array Index) was also considered, but there is no explicit evidence of an array index being the direct cause of the overflow.\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-122 accurately describing the heap-based buffer overflow and its location.",
