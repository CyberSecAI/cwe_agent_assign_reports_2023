CWE-367 is a ChildOf CWE-362 and provides a more specific description of a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. CWE-326 is related to the weak encryption also present in the referenced CVE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe326[\"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\"]\n\n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe367,cwe326 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **local host race condition** (CWE-362). Because the application does not properly synchronize access to a shared resource (lock file) during user identification, an attacker can exploit a timing window to gain unauthorized access, leading to password disclosure. The weak encryption (CWE-326) also contributes to the vulnerability by making it easier to decipher captured communications.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified a **local host race condition** in CyberArk Credential Provider, leading to password disclosure. The retriever results indicated CWE-362 as a top candidate, which aligns with the description of a race condition. The CVE reference links further confirmed the presence of CWE-362, along with weak encryption (CWE-326) and improper restriction of communication channel (CWE-923).\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-362, as it accurately describes the core issue of concurrent execution with improper synchronization. The reference links explicitly mention a **race condition** in the user identification mechanism.\n\nCWE-367 is considered a secondary CWE because the vulnerability involves a time-of-check time-of-use scenario, where the state of the lock file is checked before use, but can change in between.\n\nCWE-326 is considered a secondary CWE because the weak encryption strength also contributes to the **impact** of the vulnerability where captured communications can be easily deciphered.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-362 captures the general race condition, while CWE-367 provides a more specific description of the TOCTOU variant. Both CWEs are supported by the evidence in the vulnerability description and CVE reference links.\n\nCWE-662, CWE-667, CWE-364, CWE-609, and CWE-319 were considered but not selected. CWE-662 and CWE-667 are related to synchronization and locking, but are less specific than CWE-362 for describing the race condition. CWE-364 involves signal handlers, which are not relevant to this vulnerability. CWE-609 describes double-checked locking, which is not mentioned in the description. CWE-319 describes cleartext transmission, which is not the primary issue.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
