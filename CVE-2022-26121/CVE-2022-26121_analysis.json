CWE-497 is also a child of CWE-200. The vulnerability involves exposing a resource (report template images) to an unauthenticated user, directly aligning with CWE-668. The potential exposure of sensitive information due to this unauthorized access makes CWE-200 a relevant secondary consideration.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe668 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe497 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper access control** (**exposure of resource to wrong sphere vulnerability [CWE-668]**), leading to unauthorized access to report template images, and potentially culminating in information disclosure if those images contain sensitive data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the direct match with the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions \"**exposure of resource to wrong sphere vulnerability [CWE-668]**\".\n\nThe evidence from \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" supports this selection:\n- **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**: \"**rootcause:** **exposure of resource to wrong sphere vulnerability [CWE-668]**\"\n- **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**: \"Root cause of vulnerability: An exposure of resource to wrong sphere vulnerability, specifically an **improper authorization** issue within the FortiAnalyzer and FortiManager GUI.\"\n\nDespite CWE-668 being discouraged due to its high-level nature, its direct mention in the vulnerability description and the root cause being an **improper authorization** issue make it the primary CWE. The secondary CWE, CWE-200, is considered because the unauthorized access can lead to the **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**, though this is more of an impact than the root cause. CWE-497 was considered, but it is less specific than CWE-668 as it focuses on system-level information. The selection of CWE-668 is at the optimal level of specificity given the provided evidence, even though it is a Class-level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
