# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2022-26121

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-668 | Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Discouraged due to its high-level nature, but directly referenced in the vulnerability description. |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged as it often represents the impact, but relevant as unauthorized access leads to potential sensitive data exposure. |
| CWE-497 | Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed, but less specific than CWE-668 as it focuses on system-level information, whereas the vulnerability involves report template images. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship impacting the decision is the parent-child relationship between CWE-668 and CWE-200, where CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information) is a child of CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere). CWE-497 is also a child of CWE-200. The vulnerability involves exposing a resource (report template images) to an unauthenticated user, directly aligning with CWE-668. The potential exposure of sensitive information due to this unauthorized access makes CWE-200 a relevant secondary consideration.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper access control** (**exposure of resource to wrong sphere vulnerability [CWE-668]**), leading to unauthorized access to report template images, and potentially culminating in information disclosure if those images contain sensitive data.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on the direct match with the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions "**exposure of resource to wrong sphere vulnerability [CWE-668]**".

The evidence from "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" and "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" supports this selection:
- **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**: "**rootcause:** **exposure of resource to wrong sphere vulnerability [CWE-668]**"
- **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**: "Root cause of vulnerability: An exposure of resource to wrong sphere vulnerability, specifically an **improper authorization** issue within the FortiAnalyzer and FortiManager GUI."

Despite CWE-668 being discouraged due to its high-level nature, its direct mention in the vulnerability description and the root cause being an **improper authorization** issue make it the primary CWE. The secondary CWE, CWE-200, is considered because the unauthorized access can lead to the **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**, though this is more of an impact than the root cause. CWE-497 was considered, but it is less specific than CWE-668 as it focuses on system-level information. The selection of CWE-668 is at the optimal level of specificity given the provided evidence, even though it is a Class-level CWE.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.



## CWE-402: Transmission of Private Resources into a New Sphere ('Resource Leak')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product makes resources available to untrusted parties when those resources are only intended to be accessed by the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an externally controlled name or reference that resolves to a resource that is outside of the intended control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.



## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-669: Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly transfer a resource/behavior to another sphere, or improperly imports a resource/behavior from another sphere, in a manner that provides unintended control over that resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
