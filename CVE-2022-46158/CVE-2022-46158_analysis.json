CWE-22 is a child of CWE-706 and CWE-668.

The fix involves ensuring that requests to the `/upload` directory are routed through the PrestaShop application, allowing for access control to be enforced.\n\nThe evidence for this decision is found in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\":\n*   \"The vulnerability stems from a **lack of access control** on the `/upload` directory\"\n*   \"The primary vulnerability is the **exposure of files stored in the `/upload` directory**.\"\n*   \"The absence of proper access controls on the `/upload` directory allowed unauthenticated users to view the contents of the directory and download files.\"\n*   \"In essence, these changes ensure that requests to the `/upload` directory are routed through the PrestaShop application, allowing for access control to be enforced, and ensure that files are not directly accessible.\"\n\nCWE-200 was considered because it describes the **impact** of the vulnerability which is the **exposure of sensitive information**. However, CWE-200 is a Class level CWE and its usage is Discouraged. The root cause is more accurately described by CWE-22.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-22 is a Base level CWE that accurately describes the **improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory**.",
