The vulnerability description points to the exposure of sensitive information. CWE-358 (Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard) is considered as a secondary CWE because **insufficient policy enforcement** can be interpreted as an improper implementation of a security check.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n    cwe358[\"CWE-358: Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard\"]\n    \n    cwe358 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    cwe358 -->|CHILDOF| cwe573[\"CWE-573: Improperly Implemented Check\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe358 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient policy enforcement** which allows a remote attacker to obtain potentially sensitive information from process memory via a crafted HTML page.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **insufficient policy enforcement** in the Autofill feature of Google Chrome. This **weakness** allows a remote attacker to obtain potentially sensitive information.\n\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, specifically the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary.\" The key phrase **\"Insufficient policy enforcement\"** directly relates to the root cause, while \"obtain potentially sensitive information from process memory\" describes the impact. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms the root cause as \"A policy enforcement error in the Autofill feature\" and the impact as allowing an attacker to bypass intended security restrictions related to Autofill.\n\nCWE-200 (Information Exposure) is chosen as the primary CWE because the vulnerability ultimately results in the exposure of sensitive information. The retriever results and similar CVE descriptions also suggest CWE-200 as a possible candidate. CWE-358 (Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard) is considered as a secondary CWE because the **insufficient policy enforcement** can be seen as an improper or missing security check.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they accurately represent the root cause and impact of the vulnerability based on the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-356: Product UI does not Warn User of Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product's user interface does not warn the user before undertaking an unsafe action on behalf of that user.
