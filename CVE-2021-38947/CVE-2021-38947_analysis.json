CWE-1240 is a Base level CWE and a child of CWE-327. I chose CWE-327 as the primary because the description states the use of **weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms** which falls under the broader category of broken or risky algorithms.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe1240[\"CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\"]\n    cwe326[\"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\"]\n\n    cwe1240 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    cwe326 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe327 primary\n    class cwe1240,cwe326 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause** of using **weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms**, leading to the impact of an attacker being able to decrypt highly sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-327 as the primary candidate based on the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** and the **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**, which both highlight the use of **weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms**. The retriever results also listed CWE-327 as a top candidate. The final decision was based on a combination of these factors, with a focus on the evidence from the vulnerability description.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the use of insecure cryptographic algorithms. While more specific CWEs exist, they do not fully capture the broader issue of using weak cryptography.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
