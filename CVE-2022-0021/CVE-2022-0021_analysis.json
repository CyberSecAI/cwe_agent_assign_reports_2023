It is related to CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) as a ChildOf. This hierarchical relationship confirms that CWE-532 is a more specific instance of a broader information exposure issue. Given the specific context of logging credentials, the base CWE-532 is more appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the application **logging sensitive information** (cleartext credentials) into a log file, leading to **information exposure**.\n  - Root Cause: Logging cleartext credentials.\n  - Weakness: CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\n  - Impact: Exposure of user credentials.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis concludes that CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) is the most appropriate primary CWE for this vulnerability. This is supported by the vulnerability description stating that the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows logs the cleartext credentials of the connecting GlobalProtect user when authenticating using the Connect Before Logon feature. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also identifies \"Information Exposure Through Log Files (CWE-532)\" as a present weakness/vulnerability.\n\nThe decision is based on the evidence: \"logs the cleartext credentials of the connecting GlobalProtect user\" and the explicit mention of \"Information Exposure Through Log Files (CWE-532)\" in the CVE Reference.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was considered but deemed less specific. While the vulnerability does result in information exposure, the root cause is the logging of sensitive information, making CWE-532 a more precise match.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced

can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the
