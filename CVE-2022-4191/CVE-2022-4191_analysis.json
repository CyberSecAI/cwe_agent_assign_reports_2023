CWE-416 can be a result of CWE-120 **Buffer Copy without Checking Size** or CWE-123 **Write-what-where Condition**. The secondary CWE, CWE-787 **Out-of-bounds Write**, is a parent of CWE-124.

The vulnerability description states that \"Use after free in Sign-In in Google Chrome prior to 108.0.5359.71 allowed a remote attacker who convinced a user to engage in specific UI interaction to potentially exploit **heap corruption** via **profile destruction**.\" The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section lists \"**heap corruption**\" as a **weakness** and \"**profile destruction**\" as a **rootcause**. However, the reference link summary provides the root cause. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" further states, \"The vulnerability could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited\".\n\nThe retriever results also highly suggest CWE-416 with a score of 0.471.\nCWE-787 **Out-of-bounds Write** and CWE-122 **Heap-based Buffer Overflow** are added as secondary because **heap corruption** is mentioned, which may have been caused by an out-of-bounds write.\n\nCWE-404 **Improper Resource Shutdown or Release**, CWE-908 **Use of Uninitialized Resource**, CWE-911 **Improper Update of Reference Count** and CWE-843 **Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')** were considered but not used. These CWEs have some relevance but do not accurately describe the vulnerability compared to CWE-416. Specifically, the vulnerability is not about resource shutdown or initialization, but about using memory after it has been freed.\n\nThe final CWE selection reflects the specific details provided in the vulnerability description, focusing on the **use-after-free** condition as the primary root cause. The chosen CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity (Variant and Base), providing a detailed and accurate representation of the vulnerability.",
