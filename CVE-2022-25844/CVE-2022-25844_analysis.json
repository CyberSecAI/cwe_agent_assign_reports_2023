CWE-1333 is a more specific case of algorithmic inefficiency. Since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)\", selecting CWE-1333 is more accurate than the more general CWE-407.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe407 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of the following:\n1.  **Root Cause:** Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity (CWE-1333) due to a crafted locale rule.\n2.  **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive CPU consumption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly suggests CWE-1333 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of \"Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)\". The provided evidence supports this selection. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-1333 is a specific type of algorithmic inefficiency, making it a suitable choice.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"The package angular after 1.7.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) by providing a custom locale rule that makes it possible to assign the parameter in posPre .repeat() of NUMBER_FORMATS.PATTERNS[1].posPre with a very high value.\"\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this: \"The vulnerability is due to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in AngularJS versions 1.7.0 and higher.\" and \"By providing a custom locale rule, specifically manipulating the `posPre` parameter in `NUMBER_FORMATS.PATTERNS[1].posPre` with a high value, an attacker can trigger catastrophic backtracking in the regex engine. This results in excessive CPU usage and can cause a denial of service.\"\n\nCWE-1333 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability: the inefficient regular expression complexity leading to ReDoS.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*Reason for not selecting:* While injection is a broad category, the specific issue here is the inefficient regular expression, making CWE-1333 a better fit.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason for not selecting:* The vulnerability is not directly related to validating equivalence of inputs.\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Reason for not selecting:* While CWE-407 is related, CWE-1333 is a more specific child that directly addresses the ReDoS vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason for not selecting:* The vulnerability doesn't involve an incomplete list of disallowed inputs.\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Reason for not selecting:* The vulnerability isn't directly related to the frequency of interactions.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Reason for not selecting:* This vulnerability is more specific than a general neutralization issue.\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Reason for not selecting:* While this is related to DoS, the **root cause** is specifically the inefficient regex.\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason for not selecting:* The vulnerability doesn't involve an assertion.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n*Reason for not selecting:* Not related to the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.7",
