## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-193 | Off-by-one Error | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is **CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error)**, which is a base-level CWE. **CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow)** is a variant and is a child of **CWE-788 (Access of Memory Outside of Allocated Region)** and **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)**. The **Off-by-one Error (CWE-193)** can lead to **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119)**.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **Off-by-one Error (CWE-193)**, leading to a **Heap-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-122)**, and ultimately resulting in privilege escalation to root.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment and resulting conclusion is as follows:

The vulnerability description clearly states an "**off-by-one error** that can result in a **heap-based buffer overflow**". The CVE reference links confirm this, repeatedly highlighting both the "**off-by-one error**" and "**heap-based buffer overflow**" as the root cause and weakness, respectively.

**CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error)** is the most accurate representation of the root cause.
**CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow)** accurately describes the weakness resulting from the off-by-one error.

The selection of these CWEs is based on the provided evidence and the hierarchical relationships between CWEs. **CWE-193** is a base-level CWE, which is preferred for root causes. **CWE-122** is a variant, providing more specificity than its parent CWEs.

Other CWEs Considered:

*   **CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer)**: While a general buffer overflow, it's less specific than **CWE-122** given the heap allocation.
*   **CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound)**: While integer issues can be related to buffer overflows, the description explicitly mentions an **off-by-one error**, making **CWE-193** a better fit.
*   **CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size)**: The root cause is identified as off-by-one and is more specific.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Truncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-786: Access of Memory Location Before Start of Buffer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available. It also overlaps existing CWE entries and might be deprecated in the future.

## CWE-680: Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs a calculation to determine how much memory to allocate, but an integer overflow can occur that causes less memory to be allocated than expected, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a named chain, which combines multiple weaknesses.

## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
When converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values. If the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale:
