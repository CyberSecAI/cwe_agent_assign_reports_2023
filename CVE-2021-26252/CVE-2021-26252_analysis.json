CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is a variant of CWE-787, providing more specific information about the location of the buffer. CWE-119 is a class-level CWE that is a parent of CWE-787, representing a more general category of memory buffer errors. The choice of CWE-787 is made because it's at the base level and accurately reflects the vulnerability. While CWE-122 specifies that the overflow occurs in the heap, the description of CWE-787 is more general and encompasses heap overflows.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe122,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **heap buffer overflow** (**CWE-787**). The impact is the ability to execute arbitrary code and cause a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-787 as the primary candidate based on the **rootcause** \"Heap buffer overflow\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the **heap-buffer-overflow** as the root cause and potential for arbitrary code execution. The Retriever Results also suggest CWE-787.\n\nThe choice of CWE-787 is further supported by its Base level of abstraction, which is preferred. While CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is more specific, the evidence is sufficient to map to CWE-787 directly, indicating an out-of-bounds write condition, which is the root cause. The mapping guidance for CWE-119 discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as

resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation.
