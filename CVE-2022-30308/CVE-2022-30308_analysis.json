It is a child of CWE-77, which is a more general case of command injection. CWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, is a Class level CWE and a potential secondary weakness due to the **improper access control**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe77 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe77,cwe74 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control**, potentially leading to the **command injection** vulnerability, which allows unauthorized execution of system commands.\n  - The chain is **Improper Access Control** -> **Command Injection** -> **OS Command Execution**\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the \"http-endpoint cecc-x-web-viewer-request-on POST request doesn't check for port syntax,\" resulting in \"unauthorized execution of system commands with root privileges due to **improper access control** **command injection**.\"\n\nThe primary weakness is **command injection**, specifically CWE-78, as it directly describes the **improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this, stating that the **root cause** is the \"lack of proper input validation,\" leading to \"Command injection.\" The attacker can \"execute arbitrary system commands with root privileges.\"\n\nCWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, is a secondary weakness due to **improper access control**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" supports this by listing **improper access control** as a weakness. This means the application doesn't correctly perform the authorization check, leading to unauthorized access.\n\nThe selection of CWE-78 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **OS command injection** vulnerability. While CWE-77 is a parent CWE, CWE-78 is more specific and accurately represents the vulnerability. The MITRE mapping guidance allows for the use of CWE-78. CWE-863 is a more general class, but it is still applicable as a secondary weakness.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n*   CWE-20: Improper Input Validation - This is too general and doesn't specify the type of vulnerability.\n*   CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function - While there's **improper access control**, the root cause is the **command injection** through missing validation.\n*   CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection') - This is a parent of CWE-78, so CWE-78 is preferred.\n*   CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection') - Argument Injection might be present, but the root cause of the issue stems from the **command injection**, so CWE-78 is more descriptive.\n*   CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') - While the impact is code execution, the vulnerability is triggered by the injection of commands, making CWE-78 more appropriate.\n*   CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') - This is related to unauthorized access, but the **command injection** is the more specific weakness.",
