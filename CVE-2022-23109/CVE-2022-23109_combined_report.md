*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-549 (Missing Password Field Masking), is directly related to the vulnerability where sensitive credentials are not properly masked, leading to exposure. CWE-549 is a child of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials). CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) and CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) are also related, as the unmasked credentials are both transmitted and effectively stored in cleartext.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events is as follows:
1.  The HashiCorp Vault Plugin **failed to explicitly declare Vault credentials as sensitive** (CWE-549).
2.  As a result, the credentials were **not masked in Pipeline build logs and step descriptions**.
3.  This led to the **exposure of Vault credentials in cleartext**, effectively leading to cleartext transmission and storage (CWE-319, CWE-256).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified that the core issue was the **failure to mask the Vault credentials** in the Jenkins plugin. This is supported by the vulnerability description, which states that the plugin "does not mask Vault credentials". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating the plugin "did not explicitly declare Vault credentials as sensitive".

Based on this evidence, CWE-549 (Missing Password Field Masking) is the most accurate and specific CWE. It represents the root cause of the vulnerability which is the **missing** masking functionality for credentials.

CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) and CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) are secondary concerns, stemming from the initial failure to mask the credentials. Because of the **impact** of the unmasked credentials, those are added.

Other CWEs like CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) were considered but deemed less relevant. The core issue is not related to authorization, but to the lack of proper handling of sensitive information. Similarly, CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) is not relevant as there is no template engine involved in this vulnerability.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-549 is a Base-level CWE, representing the specific weakness. The evidence supports this choice as it directly points to the **missing** masking functionality.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-23109

## Vulnerability Description
Jenkins HashiCorp Vault Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier does not mask Vault credentials in Pipeline build logs or in Pipeline step descriptions when Pipeline Groovy Plugin 2.85 or later is installed.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** unmask Vault credentials in Pipeline build logs or in Pipeline step descriptions
- **product:** Jenkins HashiCorp Vault Plugin
- **version:** 3.7.0 and earlier

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23109:

**CVE-2022-23109**

*   **Root Cause:** The HashiCorp Vault Plugin, prior to version 3.8.0, did not explicitly declare Vault credentials as sensitive. It relied on the behavior of Pipeline: Groovy Plugin versions 2.84 and earlier, which used an allowlist of non-sensitive variables, masking everything else.  Later versions of Pipeline Groovy Plugin expect each pipeline step to declare sensitive variables to be masked.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper credential masking in Pipeline step descriptions and build logs. The plugin failed to explicitly mask Vault credentials, which were then displayed in plain text in these locations.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Exposure of Vault credentials (secrets) in pipeline build logs and step descriptions. This could lead to unauthorized access to systems and resources protected by the compromised credentials.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker who has access to Jenkins build logs or pipeline step descriptions could obtain the Vault credentials.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Attackers need to have at least Overall/Read access to view the Pipeline build logs or pipeline step descriptions.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability exists because the HashiCorp Vault Plugin did not adapt to changes in the Pipeline: Groovy Plugin's credential masking behavior.
*   The fix involves explicitly masking Vault credentials in build logs and pipeline step descriptions in HashiCorp Vault Plugin 3.8.0
*   The fix is not retroactive and administrators need to review previous build logs for leaked credentials

## CWE-838: Inappropriate Encoding for Output Context
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses or specifies an encoding when generating output to a downstream component, but the specified encoding is not the same as the encoding that is expected by the downstream component.

### Extended Description


This weakness can cause the downstream component to use a decoding method that produces different data than what the product intended to send. When the wrong encoding is used - even if closely related - the downstream component could decode the data incorrectly. This can have security consequences when the provided boundaries between control and data are inadvertently broken, because the resulting data could introduce control characters or special elements that were not sent by the product. The resulting data could then be used to bypass protection mechanisms such as input validation, and enable injection attacks.


While using output encoding is essential for ensuring that communications between components are accurate, the use of the wrong encoding - even if closely related - could cause the downstream component to misinterpret the output.


For example, HTML entity encoding is used for elements in the HTML body of a web page. However, a programmer might use entity encoding when generating output for that is used within an attribute of an HTML tag, which could contain functional Javascript that is not affected by the HTML encoding.


While web applications have received the most attention for this problem, this weakness could potentially apply to any type of product that uses a communications stream that could support multiple encodings.

- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.




## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.

### Extended Description


Many web applications use template engines that allow developers to insert externally-influenced values into free text or messages in order to generate a full web page, document, message, etc. Such engines include Twig, Jinja2, Pug, Java Server Pages, FreeMarker, Velocity, ColdFusion, Smarty, and many others - including PHP itself. Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.


Template engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression "{{7*7}}" and determine if the output returns "49" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.


In some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.


Template engines can be used on the server or client, so both "sides" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.


### Alternative Terms
Server-Side Template Injection / SSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a server.
Client-Side Template Injection / CSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a client.

### Relationships

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Since expression languages are often used in templating languages, there may be some overlap with CWE-917 (Expression Language Injection). XSS (CWE-79) is also co-located with template injection.

**[Maintenance]** The interrelationships and differences between CWE-917 and CWE-1336 need to be further clarified.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-34359:** Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a "prompt injection" attack.
- **CVE-2017-16783:** server-side template injection in content management server
- **CVE-2020-9437:** authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection




## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.


Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.


When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to "sniff" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.
