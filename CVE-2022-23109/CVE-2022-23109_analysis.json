The Vault credentials were transmitted in cleartext within the build logs and step descriptions. |\n| CWE-256 | Plaintext Storage of a Password | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. Because the credentials were not masked, they are effectively stored as plaintext in the build logs. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE, CWE-549 (Missing Password Field Masking), is directly related to the vulnerability where sensitive credentials are not properly masked, leading to exposure. CWE-549 is a child of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials). CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) and CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) are also related, as the unmasked credentials are both transmitted and effectively stored in cleartext.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe549[\"CWE-549: Missing Password Field Masking\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    \n    cwe549 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe319 --> cwe549\n    cwe256 --> cwe549\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe549 primary\n    class cwe522,cwe319,cwe256 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  The HashiCorp Vault Plugin **failed to explicitly declare Vault credentials as sensitive** (CWE-549).\n2.  As a result, the credentials were **not masked in Pipeline build logs and step descriptions**.\n3.  This led to the **exposure of Vault credentials in cleartext**, effectively leading to cleartext transmission and storage (CWE-319, CWE-256).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified that the core issue was the **failure to mask the Vault credentials** in the Jenkins plugin. This is supported by the vulnerability description, which states that the plugin \"does not mask Vault credentials\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating the plugin \"did not explicitly declare Vault credentials as sensitive\".\n\nBased on this evidence, CWE-549 (Missing Password Field Masking) is the most accurate and specific CWE. It represents the root cause of the vulnerability which is the **missing** masking functionality for credentials.\n\nCWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) and CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) are secondary concerns, stemming from the initial failure to mask the credentials. Because of the **impact** of the unmasked credentials, those are added.\n\nOther CWEs like CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) were considered but deemed less relevant. The core issue is not related to authorization, but to the lack of proper handling of sensitive information. Similarly, CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) is not relevant as there is no template engine involved in this vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-549 is a Base-level CWE, representing the specific weakness. The evidence supports this choice as it directly points to the **missing** masking functionality.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
