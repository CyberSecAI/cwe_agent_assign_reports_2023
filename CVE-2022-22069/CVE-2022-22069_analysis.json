The Base level of abstraction for CWE-312 was considered the most appropriate level of specificity for this vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe922[\"CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe922\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe311,cwe922 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of the **unencrypted storage** of the keybox which leads to a cryptographic issue. The root cause is the **unencrypted storage** and the impact is the cryptographic issue.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates that devices with keyprotect off may store **unencrypted** keybox in RPMB. This leads to cryptographic issues.\n\nThe key evidence from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" is:\n\n*   **weakness:** **unencrypted storage**\n*   **impact:** cryptographic issue\n\nThe primary CWE was selected as CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information). This is because the keybox is stored in **unencrypted** form, which directly matches the description of CWE-312. The abstraction level of CWE-312 is Base, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The usage is Allowed. The confidence level is high because the description explicitly mentions **unencrypted storage**.\n\nCWE-126 (Buffer Over-read), CWE-822 (Untrusted Pointer Dereference), CWE-1314 (Missing Write Protection for Parametric Data Values), CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition), CWE-1285 (Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input), CWE-781 (Improper Address Validation in IOCTL with METHOD_NEITHER I/O Control Code), CWE-823 (Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset), CWE-390 (Detection of Error Condition Without Action), and CWE-415 (Double Free) were considered but were not selected because they did not directly match the **unencrypted storage** weakness described in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25
