It is related to CWE-668 **Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere** (Class) through a ChildOf relationship. The secondary CWE is CWE-73 **External Control of File Name or Path**, which is also a base level CWE, and is related to CWE-552 because external control of the filename or path can lead to files being accessible to external parties. Both CWE-552 and CWE-73 are at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe552[\"CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe552 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe73 -->|RELATED_TO| cwe552\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe552 primary\n    class cwe73 secondary\n    class cwe668 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **ROOT CAUSE:** The plugin **does not properly sanitize** user input for a file path. (CWE-73)\n2.  **WEAKNESS:** This allows users to specify a file path.\n3.  **IMPACT:** Users with Item/Configure permission can **read arbitrary files** on the Jenkins controller. (CWE-552)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis and criticism focused on identifying the root cause and the resulting impact. The provided evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-552 as the primary CWE because the vulnerability ultimately results in unauthorized file access. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states: \"The plugin uses a user-controlled file path to access file system, without proper checks\" and \"An attacker with Item/Configure permission can read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller's file system\". CWE-73 is selected as a secondary CWE because the root cause is the **improper sanitization** of user-controlled file paths.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the connection between user-controlled paths (CWE-73) and the resulting exposure of files (CWE-552). Both CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity (Base).\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n## CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
