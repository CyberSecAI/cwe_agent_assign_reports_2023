It is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).\n- CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) is a Class-level CWE related to information exposure.\n- The analysis considered the relationship between these two CWEs, as a **missing permission check** (CWE-862) can lead to local information disclosure (related to CWE-668).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing permission check** (CWE-862) in telephony service.\n2.  **Impact:** Local information disclosure (related to CWE-668).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **missing permission check** as the root cause, which directly corresponds to CWE-862. The resulting local information disclosure is a consequence of this missing check.\n\nThe primary decision to map to CWE-862 is based on the explicit statement in the Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: \"**rootcause:** **missing permission check**\". This provides strong evidence for selecting CWE-862 as the primary weakness.\n\nThe retriever results also support this decision, with CWE-862 being the top-ranked CWE.\n\nCWE-668 was considered as a secondary CWE because the impact of the vulnerability is local information disclosure. However, since the root cause is the **missing permission check**, CWE-862 is the more appropriate primary CWE.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as CWE-862 directly addresses the **missing permission check**, and CWE-668 captures the impact of information disclosure.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives a complex input with multiple elements or fields that must be consistent with each other, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually consistent.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive -
