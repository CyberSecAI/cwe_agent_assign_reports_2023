The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** also stated, \"The vulnerability is a use-after-free (UAF) error\" and \"Use-after-free vulnerability exists in SwiftShader\". The primary CWE match from **CWE for similar CVE Descriptions** was also CWE-416.

At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory \"belongs\" to the code that operates on the new pointer.\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Explanation of why other CWEs were considered but not used:\n*   CWE-366, CWE-843, CWE-122, CWE-415, CWE-113, CWE-123, CWE-362, CWE-911, CWE-1021: These CWEs were considered because they appeared in the Retriever Results. However, they do not specifically describe the **use after free** condition, making CWE-416 a more precise fit. While some of these could potentially be related or result from a use-after-free, they are not the root cause in this case.",
