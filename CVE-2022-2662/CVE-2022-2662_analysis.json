The retriever suggested lower level CWEs like CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication). CWE-1390 is a child of CWE-287. Given the information at hand, and because the description states \"**improper authentication issues**\" it is safer to use CWE-287, but CWE-1390 is considered as a possible option.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe1390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe1390 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper authentication issues** (CWE-287)\n2.  **Impact:** An attacker can bypass the authentication process and gain user-level access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **improper authentication issues** as the root cause, aligning with CWE-287. The retriever results and the CVE description supported this assessment.\n\nThe provided information, especially the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section, confirms the root cause as **Improper Authentication**. Specifically, the summary states: \"*Root Cause of Vulnerability: Improper Authentication (CWE-287)*\" and \"*Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present: The device has flaws in its authentication process, potentially allowing an attacker to bypass authentication and gain user-level access.*\"\n\nGiven that CWE-287 is a Class-level CWE and the mapping guidance discourages its direct use, lower-level CWEs such as CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) were considered. However, without more specific information about the exact nature of the **improper authentication**, it's safer to stick with CWE-287.\nCWE-1390 may be appropriate if the authentication mechanism exists but is not strong enough. However, based on the current evidence, CWE-287 is the most suitable.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs authentication based on the name of a resource being accessed, or the name of the actor performing the access, but it does not properly check all possible names for that resource or actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
