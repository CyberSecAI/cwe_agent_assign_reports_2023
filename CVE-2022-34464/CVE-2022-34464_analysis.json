CWE-402 is a child of CWE-668, so it is more specific, but it doesn't completely capture the situation, so I have marked it as a possible secondary CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe402[\"CWE-402: Transmission of Private Resources into a New Sphere ('Resource Leak')\"]\n    \n    cwe402 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe668 primary\n    class cwe402 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **ROOT CAUSE:** An **improperly protected file** is used to import SSH keys.\n2.  Attackers with filesystem access inject a custom SSH key into the file.\n3.  **IMPACT:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **improperly protected file** as the root cause. This allows an attacker to inject a custom SSH key and gain unauthorized access.\n\nThe evidence for this assessment is strong: \"Affected software uses an **improperly protected file** to import SSH keys. Attackers with access to the filesystem of the host on which SICAM GridEdge runs, are able to inject a custom SSH key to that file.\"\n\nCWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) is a Class-level CWE that fits because the file, which should be protected, is accessible to unintended actors.\nCWE-402 (Transmission of Private Resources into a New Sphere) is also considered because a resource is being made available to untrusted parties. It is related because it is a child of CWE-668.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity. CWE-668 captures the essence of the **improperly protected file** issue, while CWE-402 is a related but not fully representative classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not chosen because the root cause is not the improper validation of input, but the **improper protection of a file**.*\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not chosen because the root cause is not the reliance on untrusted inputs, but the **improper protection of a file**.*\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n*This CWE was not chosen because it is too general and does not specifically address the **improper protection of a file**.*\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n*This CWE was not chosen because the root cause is not the improper handling of insufficient privileges, but the **improper protection of a file**.*\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not chosen because the root cause is not the lack of isolation or compartmentalization, but the **improper protection of a file**.*\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
