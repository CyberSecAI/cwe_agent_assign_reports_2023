The secondary CWE is CWE-20 **Improper Input Validation**, which is a Class level CWE. CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**, which in turn is a child of CWE-20. This shows a hierarchy where improper input validation can lead to buffer overflows, which can then result in out-of-bounds writes.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe119 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (CWE-20), which results in a memory corruption condition (CWE-787).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-787 as the primary weakness due to the resulting memory corruption. The vulnerability description key phrases \"lack of proper validation of user-supplied data\" points to CWE-20, but the consequence is \"memory corruption condition\" which matches with CWE-787.\n\nThe retriever results also support CWE-787 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-20 is considered a secondary weakness because the primary issue is the memory corruption resulting from the **lack of validation**. While CWE-20 is present, it's a high-level class, and the specific manifestation is an out-of-bounds write.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence that the vulnerability leads to memory corruption due to **lack of proper validation**, making CWE-787 the most specific and appropriate classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\nThis CWE was considered but not chosen because the vulnerability description doesn't explicitly mention the use of uninitialized variables. The focus is on **lack of validation** leading to memory corruption, not the state of variables.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\nThis CWE was considered but not chosen because the vulnerability description does not suggest the validation of equivalence as the main problem.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\nThis CWE was considered but not chosen because there is no evidence of locking issues in the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\nThis CWE was considered but not chosen because the vulnerability description focuses on **lack of validation** rather than initialization issues.\n\n## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\nThis CWE was considered but not chosen because the vulnerability description does not mention any unchecked return values. The issue is with the **lack of input validation**, not the handling of function returns.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\nThis CWE was considered but not chosen because the vulnerability description does not indicate an incorrect calculation of buffer size. The problem is the **lack of proper validation**, not the size calculation itself.\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\nThis CWE was considered but not chosen because the vulnerability description does not mention checks for unusual conditions.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\nThis CWE was considered, but CWE-787 **Out-of-bounds Write** is a better fit.\n\n## CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\nThis CWE was considered but not chosen because the vulnerability description focuses on **lack of validation** of user-supplied data rather than the use of uninitialized resources.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\nThis CWE was considered but not chosen because resource shutdown or release is not mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 7106.89\n**Source**: sparse\n\nThis CWE was considered but not chosen because there is no mention of integer overflow in the description.\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 7092.65\n**Source**: sparse\n\nThis CWE was considered because it is a child of CWE-20, but CWE-20 is a discouraged CWE and CWE-1284 is not specific enough to the **memory corruption** result.\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 6932.59\n**Source**: sparse\n\nThis CWE was considered, but the description indicates it should be avoided when more specific information such as CWE-787 is available.\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6636.97\n**Source**: sparse\n\nThis CWE was considered but not chosen because the vulnerability description does not mention an off-by-one error.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 5.03\n**Source**: graph\n\nThis CWE was not considered as the description is not related.\n\n## CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n**Source**: graph\n\nThis CWE was not considered as the description is not related.\n\n## CWE-170: Improper Null Termination\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n**Source**: graph\n\nThis CWE was not considered as the description is not related.\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n**Source**: graph\n\nThis CWE was not considered as the description is not related.\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n**Source**: graph\n\nThis CWE was not considered as the description is not related.\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n**Source**: graph\n\nThis CWE was not considered as the description is not related.",
