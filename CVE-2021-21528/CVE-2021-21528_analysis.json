This indicates a hierarchical relationship where CWE-548 is the most specific representation of the **information exposure** vulnerability. The parent CWEs, while relevant, are more general. The chain relationship is less significant in this case, as the vulnerability is a direct **exposure** issue rather than a complex sequence of events.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe548[\"CWE-548: Exposure of Information Through Directory Listing\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe548 -->|CHILDOF| cwe497\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe548 primary\n    class cwe497,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a single step: an **improper configuration** leads directly to **exposure of information** through directory listing.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Improper configuration** after upgrade.\n  - **Weakness:** **Exposure of Information Through Directory Listing** (CWE-548)\n  - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to filesystem, potentially leading to disclosure of sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description and CVE reference links clearly point to an **\"Exposure of Information through Directory Listing\"**.\n\nThe retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-548 as the primary candidate. While other CWEs like CWE-497 and CWE-200 are related, they are more general. CWE-548 is a variant of CWE-497, making it a more specific and appropriate choice.\n\nThe graph relationships confirm this, showing CWE-548 as a child of CWE-497 and further descendant of CWE-200. This hierarchical structure supports the selection of CWE-548 as the most specific CWE to map to the vulnerability.\n\nThe mitigation provided in the CVE reference summary involves setting a \"redirect\" flag to true in the http-config. This further supports the idea that the vulnerability is related to **improper configuration** of the webserver, leading to **exposure** of directory listings.\n\nThe confidence in the selection of CWE-548 is high (1.0) due to the clear and explicit evidence in the vulnerability description and supporting information.\n\nCWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere) was considered as a secondary candidate, since CWE-548 is a `CHILDOF` CWE-497. While accurate, it is less specific than CWE-548, so it was not selected as the primary CWE.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was also considered, but it is even more general and discouraged for use when more specific CWEs are available.\n\nUltimately, CWE-548 provides the most accurate and specific representation of the **weakness**, aligning with the provided evidence and mapping guidance.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-548: Exposure of Information Through Directory Listing\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.343\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nA directory listing is inappropriately exposed, yielding potentially sensitive information to attackers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.557\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.198\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available.",
