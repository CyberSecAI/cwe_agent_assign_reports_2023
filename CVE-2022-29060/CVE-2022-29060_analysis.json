CWE-321 is a variant of CWE-798, indicating a more specific type of hard-coded credential usage, which aligns with the vulnerability description. The chain relationships were not relevant in this case. The Variant level of CWE-321 offers the right granularity for this specific vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe321 primary\n    class cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a single root cause: the **use of a hard-coded cryptographic key**. This allows an attacker to sign JWT tokens for any device, leading to unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified a **use of a hard-coded cryptographic key** as the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description states \"A **use of hard-coded cryptographic key** vulnerability [CWE-321]... may allow an attacker who managed to retrieve the key from one device to sign JWT tokens for any device.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section explicitly mentions that \"The FortiDDoS API uses a hardcoded cryptographic key for signing JWT tokens,\" further supporting this assessment. The retriever results also ranked CWE-321 and its parent CWE-798 highly.\n\nCWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) is selected as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the **root cause** described in the vulnerability. It is a Variant-level CWE, providing a more specific classification than its parent CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials). The mapping guidance for CWE-321 recommends it's use.\n\nCWE-798 was considered but not chosen as the primary CWE because CWE-321 offers a more precise description of the vulnerability, focusing specifically on cryptographic keys rather than general credentials. While CWE-798 is a parent of CWE-321, the more specific variant is a better fit.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-656: Reliance on Security Through Obscurity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism whose strength depends heavily on its obscurity, such that knowledge of its algorithms or key data is sufficient to defeat the mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
