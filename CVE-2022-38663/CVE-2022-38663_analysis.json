The vulnerability description clearly indicates that the password field is not being masked, which directly aligns with CWE-549. CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) is also considered because the unmasked password is being written to the log file.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe549[\"CWE-549: Missing Password Field Masking\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    \n    cwe549 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe538\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe549 primary\n    class cwe532 secondary\n    class cwe522,cwe200,cwe538 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper masking of credentials** (**rootcause**), leading to the exposure of passwords in build logs (**impact**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the Jenkins Git Plugin **does not properly mask credentials** in the build log. The primary weakness is the **missing password field masking**, which directly corresponds to CWE-549. The fact that the unmasked password ends up in the log file supports the inclusion of CWE-532 as a secondary weakness.\n\nThe evidence for CWE-549 is found in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\": \"**rootcause:** **does not properly mask credentials**\" and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\": \"The Git Plugin **does not properly mask credentials** in the build log. Specifically, when using the Git Username and Password (`gitUsernamePassword`) credentials binding, the plugin masks usernames instead of passwords in cases when usernames are not set to be treated as secret.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by confirming the hierarchical structure and the specific nature of the weakness. CWE-549, being a base level weakness, is more specific than its parent, CWE-522, and accurately reflects the vulnerability. CWE-532 is selected because the unmasked information is being written to the log.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the **root cause** (CWE-549) and the resulting impact (CWE-532) of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
