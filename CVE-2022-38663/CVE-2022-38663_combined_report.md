# Analysis for CVE-2022-38663

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-549 | Missing Password Field Masking | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-532 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is that CWE-549 (Missing Password Field Masking) is a child of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials). The vulnerability description clearly indicates that the password field is not being masked, which directly aligns with CWE-549. CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) is also considered because the unmasked password is being written to the log file.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper masking of credentials** (**rootcause**), leading to the exposure of passwords in build logs (**impact**).

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis indicates that the Jenkins Git Plugin **does not properly mask credentials** in the build log. The primary weakness is the **missing password field masking**, which directly corresponds to CWE-549. The fact that the unmasked password ends up in the log file supports the inclusion of CWE-532 as a secondary weakness.

The evidence for CWE-549 is found in the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases": "**rootcause:** **does not properly mask credentials**" and the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary": "The Git Plugin **does not properly mask credentials** in the build log. Specifically, when using the Git Username and Password (`gitUsernamePassword`) credentials binding, the plugin masks usernames instead of passwords in cases when usernames are not set to be treated as secret."

The graph relationships influenced the selection by confirming the hierarchical structure and the specific nature of the weakness. CWE-549, being a base level weakness, is more specific than its parent, CWE-522, and accurately reflects the vulnerability. CWE-532 is selected because the unmasked information is being written to the log.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the **root cause** (CWE-549) and the resulting impact (CWE-532) of the vulnerability.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-38663

## Vulnerability Description
Jenkins Git Plugin 4.11.4 and earlier does not properly mask (i.e., replace with asterisks) credentials in the build log provided by the Git Username and Password (`gitUsernamePassword`) credentials binding.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **does not properly mask credentials**
- **product:** Jenkins Git Plugin
- **version:** 4.11.4 and earlier

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-38663:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.

**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Obscuring a password with a trivial encoding does not protect the password.

### Extended Description
Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties or configuration file. A programmer can attempt to remedy the password management problem by obscuring the password with an encoding function, such as base 64 encoding, but this effort does not adequately protect the password.

### Additional Notes
**[Other]** 

The "crypt" family of functions uses weak cryptographic algorithms and should be avoided. It may be present in some projects for compatibility.







## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component
in another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the
intended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.

### Extended Description


When creating commands using interpolation into a string, developers may assume that only the arguments/options that they specify will be processed. This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** At one layer of abstraction, this can overlap other weaknesses that have whitespace problems, e.g. injection of javascript into attributes of HTML tags.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-36069:** Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.
- **CVE-1999-0113:** Canonical Example - "-froot" argument is passed on to another program, where the "-f" causes execution as user "root"
- **CVE-2001-0150:** Web browser executes Telnet sessions using command line arguments that are specified by the web site, which could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.




## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication."

### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

### Extended Description


Attackers may be able to bypass weak authentication faster and/or with less effort than expected.
