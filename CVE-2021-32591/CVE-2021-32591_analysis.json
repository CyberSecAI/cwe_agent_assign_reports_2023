CWE-325 is a child of CWE-573 (Missing a Critical Step in a Process) and has a peer relationship with CWE-358 (Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard). CWE-327 is a Class level CWE and a parent of CWE-325 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe325[\"CWE-325: Missing Cryptographic Step\"]\n    cwe573[\"CWE-573: Missing a Critical Step in a Process\"]\n    cwe358[\"CWE-358: Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    \n    cwe325 -->|CHILDOF| cwe573\n    cwe325 --|PEEROF| cwe358\n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    cwe327 -->|PARENTOF| cwe916\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe325 primary\n    class cwe327,cwe916 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing cryptographic step** (CWE-325) in the encryption function. This leads to potentially weaker encryption, which can result in an attacker being able to compromise the confidentiality of encrypted secrets. The attacker needs to be in possession of the password store.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly aligns with CWE-325 (Missing Cryptographic Step) because the **root cause** of the vulnerability is explicitly described as a **\"missing cryptographic steps\"**. The vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary both confirm this. The retriever results also list CWE-325 as the top candidate.\n\nThe CVE reference links content summary states:\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nA missing cryptographic step in the function that encrypts users' LDAP and RADIUS credentials.\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Missing cryptographic steps vulnerability [CWE-325]\n\nCWE-325 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level. The description of CWE-325, \"The product does not implement a required step in a cryptographic algorithm, resulting in weaker encryption than advertised by the algorithm,\" accurately describes the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) and CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) were considered as secondary CWEs as the **missing step** could have been related to using a broken algorithm or insufficient hashing.\n\nThe selected CWE, CWE-325, is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **missing cryptographic step**, which is the **root cause** of the vulnerability.",
