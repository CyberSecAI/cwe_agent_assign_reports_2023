While CWE-284 broadly covers access control issues, CWE-863 specifically addresses cases where an authorization check is performed, but incorrectly. This aligns well with the vulnerability description's mention of **Incorrect Access Control**, suggesting that some form of authorization was intended but flawed.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a single point: a flaw in the authorization mechanism that allows unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **Incorrect Access Control** mentioned in the vulnerability description. The retriever results suggested several relevant CWEs, including CWE-284, CWE-306, CWE-732, CWE-285, and CWE-863.\n\nCWE-284 (Improper Access Control) is a high-level pillar and discouraged because more specific CWEs are available. The description mentions an attacker sending a crafted request, which implies an attempt to bypass access controls. The root cause is the **incorrect access control**, making CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) the most appropriate primary mapping.\n\nThe evidence is the phrase **Incorrect Access Control** in the vulnerability description. The confidence is high because the description aligns closely with the definition of CWE-863, where an authorization check exists but is flawed.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
