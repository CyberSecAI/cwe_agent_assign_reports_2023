    ## WEAKNESS: 'heap buffer overflow'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (Score: 332.42)

The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data....

### 2. CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 299.34)

A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc()....

### 3. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 298.17)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...

### 4. CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read (Score: 294.74)

The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....

### 5. CWE-126: Buffer Over-read (Score: 278.08)

The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer....

The product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL....

### 4. CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write (Score: 238.45)

The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....

### 5. CWE-20: Improper Input Validation (Score: 230.32)

The product receives input or data, but it does
        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the
        properties that are required to process the data safely and
        correctly....
