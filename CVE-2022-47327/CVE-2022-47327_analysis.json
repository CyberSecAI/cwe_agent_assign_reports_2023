It has child-of relationships to CWE-285 and CWE-284. CWE-280 **Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges** is a base-level CWE and is related to CWE-755. CWE-668 **Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere** is a class-level CWE. The relationship analysis influenced the decision to prioritize CWE-862 due to its direct relevance to the vulnerability description, while also considering CWE-280 as a potential contributing factor.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe280[\"CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe755[\"CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe280 -->|CHILDOF| cwe755\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe280,cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing permission check** in the wlan driver, leading to local information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **missing permission check** as the root cause, directly leading to information disclosure. The primary CWE match from the provided information is CWE-862 **Missing Authorization**. The vulnerability description key phrases highlight the **missing permission check**, which aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-862. The evidence clearly supports this classification. CWE-280 **Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges** was considered because the **missing permission check** could be interpreted as improper handling of permissions. However, the description focuses more on the absence of a check, making CWE-862 the more accurate choice. CWE-668 **Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere** was considered because the information is disclosed locally. However, this CWE is too broad, and the root cause is the **missing permission check**, not the exposure itself, and is discouraged by MITRE. The decision to use CWE-862 is well-supported by the vulnerability description and the provided CWE information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
