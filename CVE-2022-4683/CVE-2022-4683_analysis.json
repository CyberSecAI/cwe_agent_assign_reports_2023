CWE-614 is a variant that specifically addresses the **sensitive cookie in HTTPS session without secure attribute**, while CWE-319 is a more general base class. Since the vulnerability description specifically mentions a **sensitive cookie** lacking the Secure attribute, CWE-614 is the more precise and appropriate choice. The relationships to other cookie-related CWEs like CWE-1004 (Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag) and CWE-1275 (Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute) were also considered.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe614[\"CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe1004[\"CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag\"]\n    cwe1275[\"CWE-1275: Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute\"]\n    \n    cwe614 -->|CHILDOF| cwe319\n    cwe1004 -->|CHILDOF| cwe732\n    cwe1275 -->|CHILDOF| cwe923\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe614 primary\n    class cwe319,cwe1004,cwe1275 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively simple:\n1.  **Root Cause:** The application **fails to set the Secure attribute on a sensitive cookie in an HTTPS session**.\n2.  **Weakness:** This allows the cookie to be transmitted over HTTP.\n3.  **Impact:** An attacker could potentially intercept the cookie and gain unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided vulnerability description and the associated key phrases, particularly the **rootcause**, which directly mentions the **sensitive cookie in HTTPS session without secure attribute**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" does not directly relate to the cookie issue, which suggests a lack of details about the weakness, it focuses on settings validation. However, the retriever results and the CWE specifications strongly support CWE-614 as the most appropriate mapping.\n\nThe graph relationships were helpful in understanding the broader context of cookie-related vulnerabilities and the hierarchical structure of CWEs. The selection of CWE-614 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **missing Secure attribute** on a **sensitive cookie** in an **HTTPS session**, which is the core of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\n**Technical Explanation:**\n\nThe core issue is the **failure to set the Secure attribute for a cookie** used in an HTTPS session. When the Secure attribute is absent, the browser may transmit the cookie over unencrypted HTTP connections, potentially exposing it to interception by attackers.\n\n**Security Implications and Potential Impact:**\n\nAn attacker who intercepts the cookie can potentially impersonate the user, gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, or perform actions on behalf of the user.\n\n**Parent-Child Relationships and Chain Patterns:**\n\nCWE-614 is a Variant of CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information). This hierarchical relationship indicates that the fundamental problem is the transmission of sensitive information in cleartext. CWE-614 is a specific case of this general problem, focusing on cookies.\n\n**Primary or Secondary Weakness:**\n\nCWE-614 is the primary weakness, as the lack of the Secure attribute on the cookie is the direct cause of the vulnerability.\n\n**Official MITRE Mapping Guidance Influence:**\n\nThe MITRE mapping guidance explicitly ALLOWS CWE-614, stating that it is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level. The rationale emphasizes carefully reading the name and description to ensure an appropriate fit, which is clearly the case here.\n\n**CWEs Considered But Not Used:**\n\n*   **CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information):** Considered, but it's a more general class. CWE-614 is more specific and thus a better fit.\n*   **CWE-1004 (Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag):** Considered, but the description focuses on the HttpOnly flag, which is a different attribute than the Secure attribute.\n*   **CWE-1275 (Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute):** Considered, but the description focuses on the SameSite attribute, which is a different attribute than the Secure attribute.",
