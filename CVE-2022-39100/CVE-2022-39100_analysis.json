It is a child of both CWE-285 [Improper Authorization] and CWE-284 [Improper Access Control]. The vulnerability description clearly states a **missing permission check**, aligning directly with the definition of CWE-862. This indicates a lack of authorization, which is the root cause of the vulnerability. CWE-280 [Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges] and CWE-274 [Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges] are base-level CWEs that are related to privilege handling. However, the description focuses on the **missing check**, making CWE-862 the more direct and appropriate classification as the primary weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe280[\"CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\"]\n    cwe274[\"CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe280,cwe274 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing permission check** (CWE-862), which then leads to the ability to set up power management service without proper privileges. This can be seen as a direct consequence of the missing authorization. There aren't additional weaknesses mentioned in the chain, but the lack of the permission check is the enabler to the observed impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, supported by the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases,\" clearly indicates a **missing permission check**. This directly corresponds to CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]. The \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section also lists CWE-862 as the primary match.\n\nThe final decision to classify the vulnerability as CWE-862 is based on the direct evidence of a **missing permission check** in the vulnerability description: \"In power management service, there is a **missing permission check**. This could lead to set up power management service with no additional execution privileges needed.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **missing authorization** aspect of the vulnerability. While other CWEs like CWE-280 and CWE-274 relate to permissions and privileges, they don't specifically highlight the absence of an authorization check, which is the core issue described in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
