It represents the **missing authorization** check. The secondary CWE identified is CWE-522, which is a Class-level CWE. It represents the insufficient protection of credentials. CWE-862 is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), indicating a general category of authorization issues.

The impact of capturing credentials stored in Jenkins suggests CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) as a secondary weakness, because the credentials should not have been accessible in the first place without proper authorization.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-862 accurately represents the **missing authorization** check, and CWE-522 highlights the insufficient protection of stored credentials.
