The secondary CWE is CWE-916, a Base-level CWE, which is a child of CWE-327 and a more specific type of cryptographic weakness. Using CWE-916 is warranted if there's evidence of specifically weak password hashing.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    \n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe327 primary\n    class cwe916 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **risky cryptographic algorithm**. If this algorithm is used for password hashing, it can lead to **insufficient computational effort** making it easier to crack passwords. This is a classic root cause leading to impact pattern.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-327 as the primary candidate based on the **weakness** description mentioning \"**risky cryptographic algorithm**\". The retriever results also ranked CWE-327 as the top candidate. I considered CWE-916, Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort, because many of the CVEs mentioned in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section involved weak password hashing, however, the vulnerability description does not provide enough information to determine the context in which the risky cryptographic algorithm is being used. Thus, I'm including CWE-916 as a secondary candidate, but not promoting it to primary.\n\nThe final selection is based on the evidence directly provided, and the graph relationships influenced the decision to include CWE-916 as a possible secondary candidate. CWE-327 is selected because it directly addresses the root cause described in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
