## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-22, which represents the general case of path traversal. CWE-36, **Absolute Path Traversal**, is a child of CWE-22 and represents a specific type of path traversal using absolute paths. CWE-73, **External Control of File Name or Path**, is related as it describes the condition where user input influences file paths, which is a prerequisite for path traversal vulnerabilities. The abstraction levels influenced the selection by favoring the more general **Base** CWE-22 as the primary issue while acknowledging the relevance of the more specific **Base** CWE-36 and **Base** CWE-73.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **external control of a file name or path (CWE-73)**, leading to **improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory (CWE-22)**, specifically through **absolute path traversal (CWE-36)**. The chain highlights how external input allows attackers to specify paths, ultimately leading to unauthorized file access.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified **absolute path traversal** as the core issue. The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference links supports this, particularly the mention of the **unsafe use of the Flask `send_file` function** and the **lack of input validation**. The relationships between CWEs further clarified the classification. CWE-22 is a parent of CWE-36 and represents the broader category of path traversal, making it a suitable primary classification. CWE-73 is related as it describes the external control aspect.

The selection of CWE-22, CWE-36, and CWE-73 is based on the evidence that the application **does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences** and **uses external input to construct a pathname**, which allows attackers to **access files or directories outside of the restricted directory.** This is evidenced by:

*   **Vulnerability Description:** "The Atom02/flask-mvc repository through 2020-09-14 on GitHub allows **absolute path traversal** because the Flask send_file function is used unsafely."
*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** "The core vulnerability across all the listed CVEs is the insecure usage of the `flask.send_file` function in various Python Flask-based web applications. Specifically, the function is used to serve files based on user-controlled input without proper sanitization or validation, leading to absolute path traversal."

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the **root cause** of the vulnerability and provide sufficient detail for understanding and mitigating the issue.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to the identified CVEs.  Note: Since all the vulnerabilities stem from the same root cause, there is some repetition across the reports.

**Vulnerability Root Cause:**

*   **Unsafe Use of Flask `send_file` Function:** The core vulnerability across all the listed CVEs is the insecure usage of the `flask.send_file` function in various Python Flask-based web applications. Specifically, the function is used to serve files based on user-controlled input without proper sanitization or validation, leading to absolute path traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'):** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue, where attackers can manipulate file paths to access files and directories outside the intended web root directory. This is possible due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input before passing it to the `send_file` function.
*   **Unvalidated User Input:**  The applications fail to validate or sanitize user-supplied file paths. This means that a malicious user could provide an absolute path (e.g., `/etc/passwd` or `../../../../etc/passwd`) rather than a relative path as intended by the developers.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:**  The applications do not properly validate that the provided paths remain within the expected directory structure. This allows an attacker to break out of the intended directory and access other files in the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive files, including configuration files, source code, or other application-related data, potentially leading to exposure of sensitive data such as usernames, passwords, or API keys.
*  **Potential for Limited Availability Impact:** In some cases, attackers might be able to cause a denial of service by requesting access to large files repeatedly, but this is generally not the primary impact. In general, availability is not directly affected.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector is through network requests, where an attacker modifies the URL to contain a malicious file path. For example, an attacker might provide a URL containing sequences like `../` or an absolute path to escape the intended directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** In most cases, the attacker does not need any special credentials or user accounts to exploit the vulnerability; they only need to craft a specific request.
*   **Low Complexity:** Exploiting the vulnerability is simple, requiring basic understanding of HTTP requests and file path manipulation.
*   **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required by the attacker to launch the attack; they only need to send a maliciously formed request.

**Specific Details from the Content:**

*   **Vulnerable Function:** The `flask.send_file` function is consistently identified as the source of the vulnerability when handling the 'filename' parameter or other parameters relating to a path.
*   **Recommended Fix:**  The recommended mitigation is to avoid the use of `send_file` function with user supplied file paths. Where required, use `flask.safe_join` to validate paths before usage or replace calls with `flask.send_from_directory` which only allows files in a given directory to be served.
*   **Affected Projects:** Several GitHub repositories, primarily Flask-based web applications, are affected. Many of these are personal projects or small tools and not heavily maintained, which makes them susceptible to this type of vulnerability.
*   **CVSS Metrics:** The common CVSS v3 metrics include:
    *   `AV:N` (Attack Vector: Network)
    *   `AC:L` (Attack Complexity: Low)
    *   `PR:N` (Privileges Required: None)
    *   `UI:N` (User Interaction: None)
    *   `S:C` (Scope: Changed)
    *   `C:H` (Confidentiality: High)
    *   `I:N` (Integrity: None)
    *   `A:L` (Availability: Low)

**Additional Notes:**

*   The GitHub Security Lab discussions (reference #669) repeatedly pointed out the misuse of the `flask.send_file` function.
*   Some discussion revolves around whether CVEs should be assigned to minor/personal projects, given their limited scope and usage. There is an argument that reporting CVEs for such projects can lead to noise and make vulnerability databases harder to use.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

### Extended Description


Many file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as ".." and "/" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the "../" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as "/usr/local/bin" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.


### Alternative Terms
Directory traversal
Path traversal: "Path traversal" is preferred over "directory traversal," but both terms are attack-focused.

### Relationships

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add ".txt" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.

**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.

**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing "/" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).

**[Terminology]** 

Like other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use "directory traversal" only to refer to the injection of ".." and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.


Other variants like "absolute pathname" and "drive letter" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve ".." or equivalent.


**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.

**[Research Gap]** 

Incomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that "..\" is vulnerable, but not test "../" which may also be vulnerable.


Any combination of directory separators ("/", "\", etc.) and numbers of "." (e.g. "....") can produce unique variants; for example, the "//../" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama
- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the "\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)




## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as "/abs/path" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

### Extended Description
This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-31503:** Python package constructs filenames using an unsafe os.path.join call on untrusted input, allowing absolute path traversal because os.path.join resets the pathname to an absolute path that is specified as part of the input.
- **CVE-2002-1345:** Multiple FTP clients write arbitrary files via absolute paths in server responses
- **CVE-2001-1269:** ZIP file extractor allows full path




## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

### Extended Description


This could allow an attacker to access or modify system files or other files that are critical to the application.


Path manipulation errors occur when the following two conditions are met:

```
		1. An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.
		2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.
```
For example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker.

**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** CWE-114 is a Class, but it is listed a child of CWE-73 in view 1000. This suggests some abstraction problems that should be resolved in future versions.

**[Relationship]** 

The external control of filenames can be the primary link in chains with other file-related weaknesses, as seen in the CanPrecede relationships. This is because software systems use files for many different purposes: to execute programs, load code libraries, to store application data, to store configuration settings, record temporary data, act as signals or semaphores to other processes, etc.


However, those weaknesses do not always require external control. For example, link-following weaknesses (CWE-59) often involve pathnames that are not controllable by the attacker at all.


The external control can be resultant from other issues. For example, in PHP applications, the register_globals setting can allow an attacker to modify variables that the programmer thought were immutable, enabling file inclusion (CWE-98) and path traversal (CWE-22). Operating with excessive privileges (CWE-250) might allow an attacker to specify an input filename that is not directly readable by the attacker, but is accessible to the privileged program. A buffer overflow (CWE-119) might give an attacker control over nearby memory locations that are related to pathnames, but were not directly modifiable by the attacker.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)
- **CVE-2008-5748:** Chain: external control of values for user's desired language and theme enables path traversal.
- **CVE-2008-5764:** Chain: external control of user's target language enables remote file inclusion.




## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

### Extended Description
This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.

### Alternative Terms
Zip Slip: "Zip slip" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282]. It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).

## CWE-24: Path Traversal: '../filedir'
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize "../" sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

### Extended Description


This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.


The "../" manipulation is the canonical manipulation for operating systems that use "/" as directory separators, such as UNIX- and Linux-based systems. In some cases, it is useful for bypassing protection schemes in environments for which "/" is supported but not the primary separator, such as Windows, which uses "\" but can also accept "/".

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)




## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
insecure temporary file: Some people use the phrase "insecure temporary file" when referring to a link following weakness, but other weaknesses can produce insecure temporary files without any symlink involvement at all.
Zip Slip: "Zip slip" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282]. It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).

### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** 

Link following vulnerabilities are Multi-factor Vulnerabilities (MFV). They are the combination of multiple elements: file or directory permissions, filename predictability, race conditions, and in some cases, a design limitation in which there is no mechanism for performing atomic file creation operations.


Some potential factors are race conditions, permissions, and predictability.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-1999-1386:** Some versions of Perl follow symbolic links when running with the -e option, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.
- **CVE-2000-1178:** Text editor follows symbolic links when creating a rescue copy during an abnormal exit, which allows local users to overwrite the files of other users.
- **CVE-2004-0217:** Antivirus update allows local users to create or append to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a logfile.




## CWE-38: Path Traversal: '\absolute\pathname\here'
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product accepts input in the form of a backslash absolute path ('\absolute\pathname\here') without appropriate validation, which can allow an attacker to traverse the file system to unintended locations or access arbitrary files.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-1999-1263:** Mail client allows remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary files via an e-mail message containing a uuencoded attachment that specifies the full pathname for the file to be modified.
- **CVE-2003-0753:** Remote attackers can read arbitrary files via a full pathname to the target file in config parameter.
- **CVE-2002-1525:** Remote attackers can read arbitrary files via an absolute pathname.




## CWE-182: Collapse of Data into Unsafe Value
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product filters data in a way that causes it to be reduced or "collapsed" into an unsafe value that violates an expected security property.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-693
CanPrecede -> CWE-33
CanPrecede -> CWE-34

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Overlaps regular expressions, although an implementation might not necessarily use regexp's.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2004-0815:** "/.////" in pathname collapses to absolute path.
- **CVE-2005-3123:** "/.//..//////././" is collapsed into "/.././" after ".." and "//" sequences are removed.
- **CVE-2002-0325:** ".../...//" collapsed to "..." due to removal of "./" in web server.




## CWE-39: Path Traversal: 'C:dirname'
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product accepts input that contains a drive letter or Windows volume letter ('C:dirname') that potentially redirects access to an unintended location or arbitrary file.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-36

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
