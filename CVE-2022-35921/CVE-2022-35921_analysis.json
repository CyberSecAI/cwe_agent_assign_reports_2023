While it is more general, there is no specific Base or Variant that fits the vulnerability. The vulnerability involves the application performing an authorization check, but doing it incorrectly, leading to users bypassing privacy settings.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe359 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  The application has a feature to disable private discussions (**weakness: not respect private discussion disablement**).\n2.  The application **incorrectly** performs the authorization check (CWE-863).\n3.  Users are able to bypass privacy settings and initiate private discussions with users who have disabled them.\n4.  Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-359)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is that the application **does not respect private discussion disablement** by users. This is caused by an **Incorrect Authorization** (CWE-863) since the application performs an authorization check, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\nThe evidence is strong as the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly states:\n- \"The primary weakness is the failure to enforce user-defined preferences for blocking private discussions. This allows unauthorized actions to occur, violating the intended access control mechanism.\"\n- \"Logic Error: The code logic incorrectly evaluated user's block setting, which allowed bypassing the check.\"\n\nCWE-863 is a Class-level CWE, but it is the most appropriate based on the evidence provided. Although CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is the parent of CWE-863, the description for CWE-863 specifically mentions that the authorization check is performed, but it is done incorrectly. The retriever results also list CWE-863 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is included as a secondary CWE since the vulnerability ultimately leads to a privacy violation.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity given the information provided. More detailed CWEs might exist, but there isn't sufficient evidence to support them.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that

releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a

Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors
