CWE-787 is included due to **memory corruption** being described, and is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). The \"Top CWEs\" section also indicates CWE-787, CWE-125 and CWE-416 as frequent matches.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through Its Lifetime\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe362 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition** (CWE-362), which then leads to **memory corruption** (CWE-787), culminating in local escalation of privilege.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) was considered based on the description mentioning \"**memory corruption**\". However, the key phrase also mentions \"**race condition**\" and the description in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly states: \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** Concurrent execution using a shared resource without proper synchronization in audio ipi.\" This aligns better with CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization (**'Race Condition'**)).\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates a **race condition** as the root cause, with **memory corruption** as a consequence. The Retriever Results also list CWE-362 as the top combined result. While CWE-787 is present as a Top CWE for similar CVE descriptions, the root cause is better captured by CWE-362.\n\nThe final decision is to select CWE-362 as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause which is the **race condition**. CWE-787 is selected as a secondary CWE because it describes the **memory corruption** that occurs because of the **race condition**. Both selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-362 being a Class and CWE-787 being a Base.",
