CWE-613, Insufficient Session Expiration, and CWE-384, Session Fixation, are considered as secondary candidates. CWE-352 requires CWE-613, suggesting a potential relationship where insufficient session expiration could contribute to the success of a CSRF attack. CWE-384, Session Fixation, is also relevant as the vulnerability description mentions a similarity to session fixation attacks.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe613[\"CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\"]\n    cwe384[\"CWE-384: Session Fixation\"]\n    cwe346[\"CWE-346: Origin Validation\"]\n\n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe613\n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe346\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe613,cwe384 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **rootcause**: the Symfony framework regenerating session IDs but preserving the rest of the session attributes. This leads to the **weakness**: CSRF tokens not being cleared upon login, which results in the **impact**: bypassing the CSRF protection mechanism, similar to a session-fixation attack.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the most relevant CWE based on the vulnerability description and the provided context. The description clearly indicates that the vulnerability allows bypassing CSRF protection due to the improper handling of session attributes upon login.\n\nThe evidence from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" includes:\n- **rootcause:** **Symfony regenerates session ID but preserves rest of session attributes**\n- **weakness:** **cross-site request forgery**\n- **impact:** bypass CSRF protection\n\nThe evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" includes:\n- **root_cause**: \"CSRF tokens were not cleared upon successful login, allowing same-site attackers to potentially bypass CSRF protection.\"\n- **weaknesses**: [\"CSRF token fixation vulnerability\"]\n- **impact**: \"Bypass of CSRF protection, potentially leading to unauthorized actions by an attacker.\"\n\nThe retriever results also support the selection of CWE-352, as it is listed as a top candidate.\n\nCWE-352 is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability's main impact is the bypass of CSRF protection. The fact that CSRF tokens are not cleared upon login directly relates to the core issue described by CWE-352. While the vulnerability shares similarities with session fixation (CWE-384) and involves insufficient session expiration (CWE-613), the primary effect is the circumvention of CSRF protection mechanisms, making CWE-352 the most accurate classification.\n\nCWE-613 was considered because the **rootcause** involves the framework not properly invalidating the session which leads to the bypass. However, the vulnerability description focuses on the bypass of CSRF, making CWE-352 the more direct match.\n\nCWE-384 was considered because the vulnerability is similar to a session fixation attack. However, session fixation involves an attacker forcing a known session ID on a user, while this vulnerability involves the application not clearing existing CSRF tokens. Therefore, CWE-352 is a better fit.\n\nThe chosen CWE is at the compound level, which is appropriate given that CSRF is a complex issue involving multiple contributing factors.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction:** Compound\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a web server is designed to receive a request from a client without any mechanism for verifying that it was intentionally sent, then it might be possible for an attacker to trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server which will be treated as an authentic request. This can be done via a URL, image load, XMLHttpRequest, etc. and can result in exposure of data or unintended code execution.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nSession Riding\nCross Site Reference Forgery\nXSRF\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nRequires -> CWE-346\nRequires -> CWE-441\nRequires -> CWE-642\nRequires -> CWE-613\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nAccording to WASC, \"Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization.\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nCanPrecede -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-384: Session Fixation\n**Abstraction:** Compound\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nAuthenticating a user, or otherwise establishing a new user session, without invalidating any existing session identifier gives an attacker the opportunity to steal authenticated sessions.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-610\nChildOf -> CWE-610\nRequires -> CWE-346\nRequires -> CWE-472\nRequires -> CWE-441\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.",
