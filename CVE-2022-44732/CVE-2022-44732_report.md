# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2022-44732

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CWE-732** | **Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource** | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-276 | Incorrect Default Permissions | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the selection is the parent-child relationship between CWE-732 (Class) and CWE-276 (Base). CWE-276 is a more specific case of CWE-732, focusing on default permissions during installation, but both relate to assigning overly permissive access to critical resources. While CWE-276 is more specific, CWE-732 encompasses a broader range of incorrect permission assignments beyond just defaults. The relationship with CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) also plays a role, as CWE-732 can be considered a specific type of authorization issue, but the description focuses on the permission assignment itself.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events leading to the vulnerability can be described as:

1.  **Root Cause:** **Insecure folder permissions** (CWE-732, possibly CWE-276 if it's a default permission issue).
2.  **Impact:** Local privilege escalation.

There are no apparent missing links in the chain based on the provided information.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis centers around the **insecure folder permissions** leading to local privilege escalation in Acronis Cyber Protect Home Office. The vulnerability description key phrases explicitly state "**insecure folder permissions**" as the root cause.

The primary CWE selection is CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource). This choice aligns with the vulnerability description, which directly points to **insecure folder permissions**. CWE-732's description states, "The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors," which accurately reflects the vulnerability. The MITRE mapping guidance suggests "Allowed-with-Review" because it can be misused. However, in this case, it is being used correctly since the description literally calls out **insecure permissions**.

CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions) is considered a secondary CWE because if the **insecure permissions** were set during installation, then CWE-276 would be more accurate. The evidence doesn't explicitly specify if the **insecure permissions** were default permissions, so this is secondary.

CWE-427 (Uncontrolled Search Path Element) was the primary CWE match from similar CVE descriptions. However, it is not appropriate because it applies to search path issues, not general **insecure folder permissions**.

The chosen CWEs (CWE-732 and CWE-276) are at an appropriate level of specificity. CWE-732 is a Class-level CWE, which is suitable given the available information. If more details were available about how the permissions were incorrectly assigned (e.g., through inheritance), a more specific Variant could be considered. However, based on the current evidence, CWE-732 provides the best balance of accuracy and specificity.

Relevant CWE Information:
# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.



## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges 
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-281: Improper Preservation of Permissions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not preserve permissions or incorrectly preserves permissions when copying, restoring, or sharing objects, which can cause them to have less restrictive permissions than intended.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
During installation, installed file permissions are set to allow anyone to modify those files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.



## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root
