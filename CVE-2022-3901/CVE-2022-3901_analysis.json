It can precede CWE-471. CWE-79 is a base CWE and a parent of CWE-85. The relationship analysis supports the selection of CWE-1321 as the primary CWE due to its direct relevance to the **Prototype Pollution** vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1321[\"CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\"]\n    cwe915[\"CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\"]\n    cwe471[\"CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe85[\"CWE-85: Doubled Character XSS Manipulations\"]\n\n    cwe1321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe915\n    cwe1321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    cwe1321 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe471\n    cwe85 -->|CHILDOF| cwe79\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1321 primary\n    class cwe915,cwe913,cwe471,cwe79,cwe85 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with the **Prototype Pollution**, leading to the ability to execute XSS.\n\nPrototype Pollution -> XSS Execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary focus of this vulnerability is **Prototype Pollution** which leads to XSS.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states \"**Prototype Pollution** in Visioweb.js 1.10.6 allows attackers to execute XSS on the client system.\"\n\nCWE-1321 is the most appropriate because it directly addresses the **Prototype Pollution** issue. The description of CWE-1321, \"The product receives input from an upstream component that specifies attributes that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control modifications of attributes of the object prototype,\" aligns perfectly with the stated vulnerability.\n\nCWE-79 is included as a secondary CWE because the impact of the **Prototype Pollution** is the ability to execute XSS.\n\nOther CWEs like CWE-444, CWE-335, and CWE-1333 were considered based on the Retriever Results, but they do not directly address the **Prototype Pollution** aspect of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1321 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly identifies the root cause of the vulnerability.
