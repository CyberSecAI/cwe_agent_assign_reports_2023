CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is a Class-level CWE, and the vulnerability description points to a **missing permission check**, aligning well with the concept of **missing authorization**. While CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is also considered, the evidence is stronger for CWE-862. CWE-862 is child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), which is too high level and not specific.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the **missing permission check** leading to the ability to retrieve the WiFi SSID without proper authorization, resulting in local information disclosure.\n\nRoot Cause: **Missing permission check** (CWE-862) -> Information Disclosure\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is a **missing permission check**. The vulnerability description key phrases explicitly mention this. The phrase \"**missing permission check**\" aligns strongly with CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also supports this by indicating a vulnerability in the System component leading to information disclosure.\n\nThe retriever results list CWE-862 as the top candidate, further reinforcing the selection.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence of a **missing permission check** which directly relates to the concept of **missing authorization**, thus CWE-862 is the most appropriate choice. CWE-862 is at the Class level, and the description explicitly talks about the product not performing authorization checks.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives a complex input with multiple elements or fields that must be consistent with each other, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually consistent.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive -
