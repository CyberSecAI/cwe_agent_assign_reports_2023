CWE-416 is a variant and CWE-362 is a class. CWE-362 can precede CWE-416, which aligns with the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    \n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on a Resource after Expiration or Release\"]\n    cwe362 -->|CHILDOF| cwe691[\"CWE-691: Incomplete Solution for a Hard Problem\"]\n    cwe362 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\"]\n    cwe362 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe416\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe362 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')**, which then leads to **CWE-416 Use After Free**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is a **use-after-free** due to a **race condition** in io_uring timeouts. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the root cause as a race condition and the weakness as a use-after-free. The summary states, \"A use-after-free vulnerability exists due to a **race condition** between the timeout flush and removal in the Linux kernel's io_uring subsystem.\"\n\nThe Retriever Results list CWE-362 and CWE-416 as the top candidates, with high individual scores. The relationship between these CWEs, as well as the vulnerability description, support the selection of CWE-416 as the primary CWE and CWE-362 as the secondary CWE.\n\nCWE-416 Use After Free: The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. The vulnerability description clearly states a \"use-after-free\" condition. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the \"Use-after-free\" weakness, further solidifying this choice. Confidence: 1.0\n\nCWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'): The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently. The vulnerability description mentions a \"race condition\" in io_uring timeouts. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary identifies \"Race condition\" as a contributing factor. Confidence: 1.0\n\nCWE-667 Improper Locking, CWE-367 Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition, CWE-364 Signal Handler Race Condition, CWE-366 Race Condition within a Thread, CWE-609 Double-Checked Locking, CWE-662 Improper Synchronization, CWE-911 Improper Update of Reference Count, CWE-833 Deadlock: These CWEs were considered, but they were not selected because they do not accurately represent the specific vulnerability described, which involves a use-after-free condition triggered by a race condition. While some of these CWEs relate to concurrency issues, they do not directly address the memory management aspect of the vulnerability.",
