It has parent relationships to CWE-913 and CWE-915, which are base-level CWEs related to improperly controlled modification of object attributes. CWE-1321 also has a CANPRECEDE relationship to CWE-471 (Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data), indicating a potential chain where prototype pollution leads to modification of assumed-immutable data. The selection of CWE-1321 is based on its specific focus on prototype pollution, making it a more precise fit than its parents.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1321[\"CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\"]\n    cwe915[\"CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Attributes\"]\n    cwe471[\"CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)\"]\n\n    cwe1321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe915\n    cwe1321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    cwe1321 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe471\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1321 primary\n    class cwe915,cwe913,cwe471 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of URL query parameters** by the `jquery-deparam` library, leading to **prototype pollution** (CWE-1321), which can then result in denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or cross-site scripting.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary, which clearly indicate the presence of **prototype pollution** in the `jquery-deparam` library. The library **does not properly control modifications of attributes of the object prototype**, allowing malicious users to inject properties into `Object.prototype`.\n\nThe evidence directly supports the selection of CWE-1321 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')).\n\nThe graph relationships highlight the connection between CWE-1321 and broader issues of object attribute modification. However, the specific nature of the vulnerability as **prototype pollution** makes CWE-1321 the most appropriate choice.\n\nCWE-1321 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **improperly controlled modification of object prototype attributes**. The vulnerability description and the provided Proof of Concept (PoC) strongly support this classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\n  - The product **receives input from an upstream component** that specifies attributes that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it **does not properly control modifications of attributes of the object prototype.**\n  - The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" mentions: \"The `deparam` function in `jquery-deparam.js` allows attackers to **inject or modify properties of the `Object.prototype`** by crafting specific query parameters.\"\n  - The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" mentions: \"The library's recursive logic for creating nested objects **does not prevent the creation of properties on the `__proto__` object or the `constructor.prototype`**\"\n  - The attack vector is through crafted URL query parameters that are parsed by the vulnerable `jquery-deparam` library.",
