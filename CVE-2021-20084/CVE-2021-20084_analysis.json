This indicates that the vulnerability is a specific case of a more general class of weaknesses related to uncontrolled object attribute modification. CWE-1321 can precede CWE-471 (Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data). The secondary CWE, CWE-79, is a base CWE. It can be preceded by CWE-113.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1321[\"CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\"]\n    cwe915[\"CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improperly Controlled Access of Object Attributes\"]\n    cwe471[\"CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n\n    cwe1321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe915\n    cwe1321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    cwe1321 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe471\n    cwe113 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1321 primary\n    class cwe915,cwe913,cwe471,cwe79,cwe113 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of user-controlled input**, leading to **Prototype Pollution (CWE-1321)**. The `eval()` function, combined with the lack of input sanitization, creates a secondary vulnerability of **Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description and the \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section, points to CWE-1321 as the primary weakness, which the retriever results also confirm. The **Prototype Pollution** allows injection of properties into `Object.prototype`. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary highlights that the `queryStringToJSON` function **does not properly sanitize keys and values extracted from the query string**, allowing for manipulation. The use of `eval()` without sanitization also leads to XSS.\n\nThe evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary is strong: \"Due to the **lack of validation or sanitization** of the parameter keys, it's possible to inject parameters that modify the prototype of the Object class.\" This directly supports the selection of CWE-1321.\n\nThe \"Top CWEs\" section lists CWE-1321 as the most frequent match for similar CVE descriptions, further solidifying the choice. The relationship graph confirms CWE-1321 as a Variant, providing the right level of specificity.\n\nCWE-79 is selected as a secondary CWE because the use of `eval(decodeURIComponent(params))` when processing JSON strings directly exposes the application to XSS attacks.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-1321 being a Variant and CWE-79 being a Base.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because it is more specific to HTML tags, while the eval() function allows for more general JavaScript execution.*\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because the core issue is the modification of object prototypes, not the validation of equivalence.*\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
