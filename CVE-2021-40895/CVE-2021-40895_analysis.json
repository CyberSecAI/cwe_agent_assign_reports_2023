The vulnerability is a **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)** due to a **poorly written regular expression**. The `todo-regex` package is vulnerable because a crafted input string can cause the regular expression matching to take an extremely long time, leading to a denial of service.\n\nThe retriever results strongly suggest CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity) as the most relevant CWE.
