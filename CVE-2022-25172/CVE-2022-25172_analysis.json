While CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a parent, it's discouraged for use as it represents the impact rather than the root cause. CWE-1004 directly addresses the **missing HttpOnly flag**, which is the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1004[\"CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Security-Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe1004 -->|CHILDOF| cwe732\n    cwe200 -->|Parent| cwe1004\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1004 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing HttpOnly flag** on the session cookie (CWE-1004).\n2.  **Weakness:** This allows the session cookie to be accessible via JavaScript.\n3.  **Attack Vector:** An attacker performs a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack (CWE-79).\n4.  **Impact:** The attacker steals the session cookie, leading to unauthorized access (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, CWE-200 seemed like a potential candidate due to the **information disclosure** aspect of the vulnerability, but it's discouraged by MITRE as it often represents the impact rather than the **root cause**. The vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary clearly point to the **missing HttpOnly flag** as the central issue, which aligns perfectly with CWE-1004. The retriever results also listed CWE-1004 as the second most likely candidate. The final decision favors CWE-1004 because it's a more specific, variant-level CWE that accurately reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\nThe supporting evidence is:\n*   \"The session cookie misses the HttpOnly flag\" from Vulnerability Description Key Phrases.\n*   \"The web interface session cookie is set without the HttpOnly flag\" from CVE Reference Links Content Summary.\n*   \"The session cookie lacks the HttpOnly flag, making it accessible via JavaScript\" from CVE Reference Links Content Summary.\n\nThis evidence directly supports the selection of CWE-1004.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.

As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available.
