## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** of storing API keys unencrypted. This leads to the exposure of those keys to attackers who have access to the Jenkins controller file system or to users with Extended Read permissions. The root cause is the **insecure storage of credentials**, and the impact is unauthorized access to the API keys.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment pointed towards CWE-256, CWE-522, and CWE-260. After reviewing the vulnerability description and the provided CWE specifications, CWE-256, Plaintext Storage of a Password, was selected as the primary CWE because the OpsGenie Plugin **stores API keys unencrypted** in configuration files. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-256.

The evidence supporting this decision is:

*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** "**weakness:** **stores API keys unencrypted**"
*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** "**Root cause of vulnerability**: The OpsGenie Plugin stores API keys unencrypted." "**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin stores API keys in plain text in the global configuration file `com.opsgenie.integration.jenkins.OpsGenieNotifier.xml` and in job `config.xml` files."

CWE-522, Insufficiently Protected Credentials, is a broader class that encompasses various ways credentials can be insecurely handled, so it can be a secondary candidate.
CWE-260, Password in Configuration File, while relevant, is not as precise as CWE-256 because the vulnerability involves API keys, not necessarily passwords, although API Keys are credentials.

Therefore, CWE-256 is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability. The selection is based on the evidence and aligns with the MITRE mapping guidance.

### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

### Extended Description


This could allow an attacker to access or modify system files or other files that are critical to the application.


Path manipulation errors occur when the following two conditions are met:

```
		1. An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.
		2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.
```
For example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** CWE-114 is a Class, but it is listed a child of CWE-73 in view 1000. This suggests some abstraction problems that should be resolved in future versions.

**[Relationship]** 

The external control of filenames can be the primary link in chains with other file-related weaknesses, as seen in the CanPrecede relationships. This is because software systems use files for many different purposes: to execute programs, load code libraries, to store application data, to store configuration settings, record temporary data, act as signals or semaphores to other processes, etc.


However, those weaknesses do not always require external control. For example, link-following weaknesses (CWE-59) often involve pathnames that are not controllable by the attacker at all.


The external control can be resultant from other issues. For example, in PHP applications, the register_globals setting can allow an attacker to modify variables that the programmer thought were immutable, enabling file inclusion (CWE-98) and path traversal (CWE-22). Operating with excessive privileges (CWE-250) might allow an attacker to specify an input filename that is not directly readable by the attacker, but is accessible to the privileged program. A buffer overflow (CWE-119) might give an attacker control over nearby memory locations that are related to pathnames, but were not directly modifiable by the attacker.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)
- **CVE-2008-5748:** Chain: external control of values for user's desired language and theme enables path traversal.
- **CVE-2008-5764:** Chain: external control of user's target language enables remote file inclusion.
