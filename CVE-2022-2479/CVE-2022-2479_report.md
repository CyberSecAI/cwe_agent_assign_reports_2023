# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2022-2479

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.9 | Class | Discouraged | The vulnerability stems from **insufficient validation of untrusted input**, allowing attackers to manipulate input in unexpected ways. |
| CWE-22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | An attacker can **obtain potentially sensitive information from internal file directories** via path traversal using a crafted HTML page. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is the **improper input validation**, represented by CWE-20. CWE-22 (Path Traversal) is a consequence of the **insufficient input validation** that allows an attacker to access unauthorized file paths.

## Vulnerability Chain
1.  **Root Cause:** **Insufficient validation of untrusted input** (CWE-20)
2.  **Weakness:** Allowing attacker to supply crafted HTML page.
3.  **Impact:** Obtaining potentially sensitive information from internal file directories (CWE-22).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified **insufficient validation of untrusted input** as the root cause, with the resulting impact being access to sensitive information via crafted input. The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE details supports this assessment.

*   The vulnerability description states: "**Insufficient validation of untrusted input** in File in Google Chrome on Android prior to 103.0.5060.134 allowed an attacker who convinced a user to install a malicious app to obtain potentially sensitive information from internal file directories via a crafted HTML page."
*   The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms: "root_cause: **Insufficient validation of untrusted input** in File."

CWE-20 is used despite being discouraged because it reflects the general **lack of input validation** that leads to the exploit. The subsequent path traversal (CWE-22) is a direct consequence of this **lack of validation**, as the attacker can manipulate file paths to access restricted directories.

CWE-20 is appropriate because the core issue revolves around the product's failure to properly validate input, which then leads to further exploitable conditions.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.81
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Rationale for Not Using*: While this CWE focuses on validation, it's specific to equivalence, which isn't explicitly detailed in the vulnerability description.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Rationale for Not Using*: This CWE implies a filtering mechanism exists, but is incomplete. The vulnerability description does not explicitly state this.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Rationale for Not Using*: While the vulnerability involves untrusted input, it's the **lack of validation**, rather than reliance on the input for a security decision, that's the core issue.

## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Rationale for Not Using*: Similar to CWE-184, this implies an allow list that's too permissive. The description doesn't confirm this.

## CWE-606: Unchecked Input for Loop Condition
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly check inputs that are used for loop conditions, potentially leading to a denial of service or other consequences because of excessive looping.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Rationale for Not Using*: The vulnerability description doesn't involve loop conditions.

## CWE-115: Misinterpretation of Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product misinterprets an input, whether from an attacker or another product, in a security-relevant fashion.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Rationale for Not Using*: While misinterpretation could occur, the root cause is the **lack of validation**.

## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. This is often a component in phishing attacks.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Rationale for Not Using*: This is related to UI issues, which are not detailed in the vulnerability.

## CWE-838: Inappropriate Encoding for Output Context
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses or specifies an encoding when generating output to a downstream component, but the specified encoding is not the same as the encoding that is expected by the downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Rationale for Not Using*: This relates to encoding issues, which are not described in the vulnerability.

## CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives a complex input with multiple elements or fields that must be consistent with each other, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually consistent.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Rationale for Not Using*: There isn't explicit mention of consistency issues within the input.

## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type
