CWE-378 is also a child of CWE-377, representing a broader category of insecure temporary file creation. The vulnerability involves creating temporary files with insecure permissions, making CWE-379 the most specific and relevant choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe379[\"CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions\"]\n    cwe378[\"CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions\"]\n    cwe377[\"CWE-377: Insecure Temporary File\"]\n\n    cwe379 -->|CHILDOF| cwe377\n    cwe378 -->|CHILDOF| cwe377\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe379 primary\n    class cwe378,cwe377 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the creation of a temporary file due to the size of the InputStream, followed by the assignment of insecure permissions to that file, leading to potential information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a clear case of creating temporary files with insecure permissions. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions that the created temporary files are readable by other users on Unix-like systems due to **improper file permissions**. This aligns directly with CWE-379, which describes the creation of temporary files in directories with insecure permissions. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section also confirms that **insecure temporary file creation** is a key weakness.\n\nThe choice of CWE-379 is supported by the evidence provided and the CWE's description. It is also the most specific CWE available, residing at the Base level of abstraction. While CWE-377 and CWE-378 were considered, they are less specific than CWE-379.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.83\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a temporary file in a directory whose permissions allow unintended actors to determine the file's existence or otherwise access that file.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nOpening temporary files without appropriate measures or controls can leave the file, its contents and any function that it impacts vulnerable to attack.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-377: Insecure Temporary File\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nCreating and using insecure temporary files can leave application and system data vulnerable to attack.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
