It is a child of CWE-407 (Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity), indicating a more general class of weaknesses related to algorithmic efficiency. There are no chain relationships that directly apply to this vulnerability based on the provided data.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe407 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of:\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-1333 (**Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity**) due to the use of a regular expression with potentially exponential worst-case computational complexity.\n2.  **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive CPU consumption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is a **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDOS)** in the `validate-data` package. The **weakness** lies in the way the package handles email validation, becoming computationally expensive when handling long, invalid email strings. The **root cause** is the inefficient regular expression used for validating emails, which can lead to excessive CPU consumption and a denial-of-service.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-1333 (**Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity**). This CWE accurately describes the **root cause**, where the regular expression's inefficiency leads to a denial-of-service. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states that \"The `validate-data` package is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack when validating crafted invalid emails with long strings,\" and that \"The vulnerability lies in the way the `validate-data` package handles email validation. It becomes computationally expensive when handling long, invalid email strings, leading to a denial-of-service.\"\n\nI considered other CWEs but decided against them. CWE-777 (**Regular Expression without Anchors**) was considered but is not applicable because the vulnerability is not about missing anchors in the regex but about the regex's inherent inefficiency. CWE-407 (**Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity**) is a parent of CWE-1333, making CWE-1333 a more specific and appropriate choice. CWE-674 (**Uncontrolled Recursion**) is not applicable as the issue is related to the regular expression's backtracking behavior, not recursion.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1333 is based on its direct relevance to the vulnerability description, the provided evidence, and the MITRE mapping guidance. The retriever results also indicate CWE-1333 as the top candidate with a score of 1.0.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
