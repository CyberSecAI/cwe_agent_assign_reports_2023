# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-36 | Absolute Path Traversal | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE |
| CWE-73 | External Control of File Name or Path | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-22, which is a base-level CWE describing the **improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory**, which aligns with the **absolute path traversal** vulnerability described. CWE-36, **Absolute Path Traversal**, is a child of CWE-22, representing a more specific case. CWE-73, **External Control of File Name or Path**, represents the broader issue of user-controlled file paths, which can lead to path traversal. The relationships show a progression from a general issue (CWE-73) to a specific type of path traversal (CWE-36) within the broader category of **improper path limitation** (CWE-22).

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **external control of the filename or path** (CWE-73), which is then followed by the **improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory ('Path Traversal')** (CWE-22), specifically manifested as **absolute path traversal** (CWE-36). This leads to the impact of arbitrary file access.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified the **absolute path traversal** vulnerability due to the unsafe use of the Flask `send_file` function. The root cause is the **improper handling of user-supplied paths**, allowing attackers to access files outside the intended directory. The evidence supporting this assessment is:

*   "The sravaniboinepelli/AutomatedQuizEval repository through 2020-04-27 on GitHub allows **absolute path traversal** because the Flask send_file function is used unsafely."
*   "All of the listed CVEs stem from the same root cause: **unsafe usage of the `Flask` framework's `send_file` function.** Specifically, the applications pass user-controlled input directly to the `send_file` function without proper sanitization or validation. This allows for **absolute path traversal**."
*   "**Absolute Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The core vulnerability is that an attacker can manipulate the filename or path parameters to access files outside of the intended directory. This is possible because the application directly uses user-provided paths in the `send_file` function call without validating the path for unsafe characters like `..`."

Based on the provided evidence and the CWE specifications, the optimal level of specificity is achieved by mapping the vulnerability to CWE-22, which represents the **improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory ('Path Traversal')**. CWE-36 (**Absolute Path Traversal**) is also considered since it is a child of CWE-22 and it describes the specific vulnerability, but CWE-22 is a better fit because of the description. CWE-73 (**External Control of File Name or Path**) is also relevant because the vulnerability involves user-controlled input influencing file paths, but it is a broader category than CWE-22.

CWE-23 (**Relative Path Traversal**) was considered but not chosen because the vulnerability is specifically related to **absolute path traversal**, not relative path traversal. Other CWEs like CWE-59 (**Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')**) and CWE-41 (**Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence**) were also considered but deemed less relevant as they do not directly address the root cause of **improper path limitation**.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to the listed CVEs:

**General Root Cause:**

All of the listed CVEs stem from the same root cause: **unsafe usage of the `Flask` framework's `send_file` function.** Specifically, the applications pass user-controlled input directly to the `send_file` function without proper sanitization or validation. This allows for **absolute path traversal**.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Absolute Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The core vulnerability is that an attacker can manipulate the filename or path parameters to access files outside of the intended directory. This is possible because the application directly uses user-provided paths in the `send_file` function call without validating the path for unsafe characters like `..`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality:** An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's file system. This can expose sensitive data like source code, configuration files, database credentials, or other private information.
*  **Availability**: In some cases an attacker may cause a partial denial of service by making multiple requests to access large files, though the impact on availability is generally low.
*   **Scope Change:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to access resources outside the security scope of the web application, potentially affecting other components of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is typically performed remotely through network requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   **HTTP Requests:** Malicious requests are crafted with manipulated URL parameters that control the file path argument being passed to Flask's `send_file` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
*   **No authentication:** None of the provided content indicates that any authentication is needed for this vulnerability to be exploited.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is consistently described across different repositories as a result of unsafely using `Flask`'s `send_file` function.
*   The vulnerability is often found in simple Flask apps that do not have the proper security measures.
*   Many of the affected repositories appear to be personal projects or hobby applications.
*  Several of the reports mention that the issue is being found using CodeQL scans, and is an example of a known code pattern for path traversal.
* Some entries also mention that the issue was fixed by sanitizing user input with `flask.safe_join` or using `flask.send_from_directory` instead of `flask.send_file`.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

### Extended Description


Many file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as ".." and "/" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the "../" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as "/usr/local/bin" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.


### Alternative Terms
Directory traversal
Path traversal: "Path traversal" is preferred over "directory traversal," but both terms are attack-focused.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-706
ChildOf -> CWE-706
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add ".txt" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.

**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.

**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing "/" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).

**[Terminology]** 

Like other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use "directory traversal" only to refer to the injection of ".." and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.


Other variants like "absolute pathname" and "drive letter" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve ".." or equivalent.


**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.

**[Research Gap]** 

Incomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that "..\" is vulnerable, but not test "../" which may also be vulnerable.


Any combination of directory separators ("/", "\", etc.) and numbers of "." (e.g. "....") can produce unique variants; for example, the "//../" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama
- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the "\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)




## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as "/abs/path" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

### Extended Description
This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-31503:** Python package constructs filenames using an unsafe os.path.join call on untrusted input, allowing absolute path traversal because os.path.join resets the pathname to an absolute path that is specified as part of the input.
- **CVE-2002-1345:** Multiple FTP clients write arbitrary files via absolute paths in server responses
- **CVE-2001-1269:** ZIP file extractor allows full path




## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

### Extended Description


This could allow an attacker to access or modify system files or other files that are critical to the application.


Path manipulation errors occur when the following two conditions are met:

```
		1. An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.
		2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.
```
For example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker.

### Alternative Terms

**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** CWE-114 is a Class, but it is listed a child of CWE-73 in view 1000. This suggests some abstraction problems that should be resolved in future versions.

**[Relationship]** 

The external control of filenames can be the primary link in chains with other file-related weaknesses, as seen in the CanPrecede relationships. This is because software systems use files for many different purposes: to execute programs, load code libraries, to store application data, to store configuration settings, record temporary data, act as signals or semaphores to other processes, etc.


However, those weaknesses do not always require external control. For example, link-following weaknesses (CWE-59) often involve pathnames that are not controllable by the attacker at all.


The external control can be resultant from other issues. For example, in PHP applications, the register_globals setting can allow an attacker to modify variables that the programmer thought were immutable, enabling file inclusion (CWE-98) and path traversal (CWE-22). Operating with excessive privileges (CWE-250) might allow an attacker to specify an input filename that is not directly readable by the attacker, but is accessible to the privileged program. A buffer overflow (CWE-119) might give an attacker control over nearby memory locations that are related to pathnames, but were not directly modifiable by the attacker.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)
- **CVE-2008-5748:** Chain: external control of values for user's desired language and theme enables path traversal.
- **CVE-2008-5764:** Chain: external control of user's target language enables remote file inclusion.




## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

### Extended Description
This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.

### Alternative Terms
Zip Slip: "Zip slip" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282]. It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).

- **CVE-2019-20916:** Python package manager does not correctly restrict the filename specified in a Content-Disposition header, allowing arbitrary file read using path traversal sequences such as "../"




## CWE-37: Path Traversal: '/absolute/pathname/here'
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product accepts input in the form of a slash absolute path ('/absolute/pathname/here') without appropriate validation, which can allow an attacker to traverse the file system to unintended locations or access arbitrary files.

## CWE-24: Path Traversal: '../filedir'
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize "../" sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

### Extended Description


This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.


The "../" manipulation is the canonical manipulation for operating systems that use "/" as directory separators, such as UNIX- and Linux-based systems. In some cases, it is useful for bypassing protection schemes in environments for which "/" is supported but not the primary separator, such as Windows, which uses "\" but can also accept "/".

## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

### Extended Description

### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** 

Link following vulnerabilities are Multi-factor Vulnerabilities (MFV). They are the combination of multiple elements: file or directory permissions, filename predictability, race conditions, and in some cases, a design limitation in which there is no mechanism for performing atomic file creation operations.


Some potential factors are race conditions, permissions, and predictability.
