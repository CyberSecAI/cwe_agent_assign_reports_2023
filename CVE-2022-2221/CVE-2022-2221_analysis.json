CWE-256 is a more specific base-level weakness that directly addresses the storage of credentials in plaintext.\nCWE-538 is related to CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information), but focuses on insertion of information into externally accessible files.\nCWE-200 is high level, and lower level CWEs are preferrable.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe538[\"CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe538 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe538,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **insecure default configuration** leading to **plaintext storage of credentials** which then results in **exposure of sensitive information** to unauthorized actors.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability was described as an **Exposure vulnerability**. The analysis focused on identifying the root cause of this **exposure**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary revealed that the core issue was that credentials were being saved in a shared data source by default instead of locally. This points towards **insecure storage of credentials**.\n\nThe Retriever Results suggested several CWEs, including:\n* CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password)\n* CWE-538 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory)\n* CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor)\n\nCWE-256 was selected as the primary CWE because the **rootcause** was the **plaintext storage of credentials**, which matches the description of CWE-256 exactly.\nThe vulnerability description states that the application defaulted to storing credentials in a shared data source. This implies that the credentials themselves were stored in a way that was accessible to multiple users, which increases the likelihood of **exposure** if the shared data source is compromised or if access controls are not properly implemented.\n\nCWE-538 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory) was considered as a secondary CWE. This is because the vulnerability involves placing sensitive information (credentials) into a shared data source that is accessible to multiple users. The shared data source can be considered an externally-accessible file or directory in this context.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was also considered, but ultimately deemed less specific than CWE-256 and CWE-538. While the vulnerability does result in the exposure of sensitive information, the root cause is the **insecure storage** of the credentials and the **placement of those credentials** in a shared location.\nCWE-200 is too high level and recommends lower level CWE's be used instead.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
