The application stores user input data temporarily.\n2.  A specially crafted URL allows retrieval of this data without authentication.\n3.  This leads to exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-200 as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description clearly states that the application allows retrieval of user input data via a specific URL, leading to the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nThe **Vulnerability Description** states:\n\"Mailform Pro CGI 4.3.1 and earlier allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to **obtain the user input data** by having a use of the product to access a **specially crafted URL**.\"\n\nThe **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** states:\n\"**Information Disclosure (CWE-200):** The application allows retrieval of user input data via a specific URL within a 30-second window after form submission. This data is exposed in JSON format.\"\n\nThis aligns with the description of CWE-200, which states: \"The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\"\n\nThe Retriever Results also lists CWE-200 as the top combined result.\n\nWhile CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE and is generally discouraged, in this specific case, it accurately captures the essence of the vulnerability, which is the direct exposure of sensitive user input data without proper authorization. Given the information available, a more specific CWE cannot be determined. The evidence explicitly points to information exposure, and there's no clear indication of improper input validation or other root causes. Therefore, despite the general guidance to avoid Class-level CWEs, CWE-200 is the most appropriate choice based on the provided evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n**Rationale for not selecting:** This vulnerability does not involve path traversal.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.

The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n**Rationale for not selecting:** This vulnerability does not involve path equivalence.\n\n## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a

Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize \"../\" sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n**Rationale for not selecting:** This vulnerability does not involve path traversal.\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence

Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n**Rationale for not selecting:** This vulnerability does not involve injection.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n**Rationale for not selecting:** This is a higher level CWE and CWE-200 is a better fit.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n**Rationale for not selecting:** This is a possibility but CWE-200 is a better fit.\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 10012.88\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the

selecting:** This vulnerability does not involve path traversal.\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 9668.23\n**Source**:
