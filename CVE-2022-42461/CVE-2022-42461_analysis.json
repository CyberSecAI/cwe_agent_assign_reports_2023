An unprivileged user is able to perform actions reserved for higher privileged users due to the **incorrect authorization** check.\n- **Root Cause:** **Broken Access Control**\n- **Weakness:** **Incorrect Authorization**\n- **Impact:** Unprivileged user performs actions reserved for higher privileged users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, particularly the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" highlighting the **rootcause** as \"**broken access control**\" and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" describing the lack of proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by providing a hierarchy of CWEs related to access control. CWE-284 is too general, but it points to more specific options like CWE-863 and CWE-639.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is chosen as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description indicates that an authorization check is performed, but it's done incorrectly, allowing an unprivileged user to execute actions they should not be able to. This aligns well with the definition of CWE-863.\n\nThe selection of CWE-863 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately captures the **rootcause** of the vulnerability as an **incorrect authorization** check, rather than a complete lack of authorization (CWE-862) or a missing authentication (CWE-306). While CWE-639 is more specific, it assumes a user manipulating a key to access another user's data, which doesn't perfectly fit the scenario of an unprivileged user gaining higher privileges due to **broken access control**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
