# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2022-1358

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the CWE selection is the ChildOf relationship. CWE-89 is a child of CWE-943 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic) and CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')). While CWE-74 and CWE-943 are more general, CWE-89 specifically addresses SQL Injection, which aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description. The abstraction level of CWE-89 is Base, which is the preferred level.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is straightforward:
1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper neutralization of special elements** used in an SQL command (CWE-89).
2.  **Impact:** Data exfiltration from the cnMaestro database.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis and the detailed information provided strongly support the selection of CWE-89.

The vulnerability description explicitly states "**improper neutralization of special elements** used in an SQL command," which directly corresponds to the description of CWE-89.

The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section further reinforces this by stating: "Root Cause: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities: SQL Injection (CWE-89)."

The graph relationships confirm that CWE-89 is a specific type of injection vulnerability, making it the most appropriate choice.

The evidence provided is sufficient and directly supports the selection of CWE-89. The description aligns perfectly with the characteristics of SQL injection. The CWE is at the optimal level of specificity (Base).

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

CWE-80 was not selected because the vulnerability is related to SQL commands, not HTML.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

CWE-74 was considered but not selected because it is a high-level class. CWE-89 is more specific and better describes the vulnerability.

## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

CWE-138 was considered but not selected because it is a class-level CWE. CWE-89 is more specific and better describes the vulnerability.

## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

CWE-917 was not selected because the vulnerability is related to SQL commands, not Expression Language statements.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

CWE-184 was not selected because the vulnerability is not about an incomplete list of disallowed inputs but about improper neutralization in SQL commands.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

CWE-116 was not selected because it is a class-level CWE. Also, the problem is not just about encoding/escaping of output but specifically about SQL commands.

## CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates a query intended to access or manipulate data in a data store such as a database, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that can modify the intended logic of the query.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

CWE-943 was considered but not selected because CWE-89, a child of CWE-943, is more specific to SQL injection.

## CWE-1236: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product saves user-provided information into a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as a command when the file is opened by a spreadsheet product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

CWE-1236 was not selected because the vulnerability is related to SQL commands, not CSV files.

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.
