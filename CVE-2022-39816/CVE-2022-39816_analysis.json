CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) is also a child of CWE-522. The vulnerability is a clear case of storing a password in plaintext, making CWE-256 the most specific and appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe522,cwe312 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) - The administrator password is stored in cleartext.\n2.  **Weakness:** CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) - The credentials are not adequately protected.\n3.  **Impact:** An authenticated attacker can read the cleartext administrator password, potentially leading to unauthorized access and system compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis, based on the vulnerability description stating \"**Insufficiently Protected Credentials** (cleartext administrator password)\", and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which specifies the \"**vulnerability**: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\" and \"**root_cause**: The web application inserts plaintext passwords in the HTML source code\", strongly points towards a credential protection issue. The retriever results also highlight CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) and CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) as top candidates.\n\nThe graph relationships clarify that CWE-256 is a more specific child of CWE-522. Given the explicit mention of \"cleartext administrator password\", CWE-256 is the most accurate and specific CWE to describe the vulnerability. While CWE-522 is a valid higher-level classification, CWE-256 provides a more precise description of the **rootcause**.\n\nCWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) was also considered because it describes the storage of sensitive information in cleartext, but CWE-256 is more specific because it focuses on passwords.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the **rootcause** described in the vulnerability description and CVE details, which is the storage of a password in plaintext.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.216\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nStoring a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.207\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.158\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users.
