While CWE-200 is a broader classification, CWE-201 specifically addresses the scenario where sensitive information is actively included in transmitted data. Since the vulnerability involves the inclusion of the Authorization header in the HTTP request sent to the S3 service, CWE-201 is a more precise fit. CWE-522 **Insufficiently Protected Credentials** is also relevant, as the Authorization header contains credentials. However, CWE-201 focuses on the act of sending the data, while CWE-522 is more general.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  The `scs-library-client` **incorrectly includes** the HTTP `Authorization` header when following redirects. (CWE-201)\n2.  This leads to the **exposure** of user credentials to a third-party S3 service. (CWE-200)\n3.  An attacker with access to the S3 service can then **extract** user credentials and impersonate the user.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis indicated several potential CWEs, with CWE-201, CWE-200, and CWE-522 being the most relevant.\n\nThe selection of CWE-201 is primarily based on the evidence that the vulnerability involves the **insertion** of the Authorization header (containing sensitive credentials) into an HTTP request sent to a third-party server. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly states that the vulnerability stems from the \"incorrectly including the HTTP `Authorization` header when following redirects.\"\n\nWhile CWE-200 is a parent of CWE-201, it's a broader category, and CWE-201 more accurately captures the specific mechanism of the **information leakage**. CWE-522 is also relevant, but it focuses more on the protection of credentials in general, rather than the specific act of sending them to an unauthorized party.\n\nThe evidence directly supports the selection of CWE-201 as the primary CWE. The other CWEs were considered but deemed less specific.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-201 being a Base level CWE, which is preferred for root cause analysis.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
