## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Discouraged |
| CWE-610 | Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the selection was the parent-child relationship, specifically how CWE-20 is a high-level class that encompasses the more specific types of input validation errors. Although CWE-20 is discouraged, there isn't a more specific CWE that directly addresses the **lack of URL validation** leading to the opening of external programs. There's also a relationship between CWE-20 and its potential impact, like arbitrary program execution, though the provided description focuses more on the validation aspect.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events for this vulnerability starts with the **lack of URL validation (CWE-20)**. This leads to the potential execution of external programs, going against the intended behavior of opening the URL in the default browser.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis pointed towards **CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)** due to the stated **lack of URL validation**. While CWE-20 is a high-level Class and typically discouraged, the provided information doesn't pinpoint a more specific validation error. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions "Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)" as a weakness. The vulnerability description key phrases also support this with "**rootcause:** **Lack of validation of URLs**".

The Retriever Results also lists CWE-20. I considered the more specific CWEs in the retriever results, but none of them fit the specific vulnerability as well as CWE-20. For example, CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is relevant if the URL's length or specific components were not validated, but the description highlights a general lack of validation rather than a failure to validate a particular quantity or format.

Based on the evidence, I am confident that CWE-20 accurately represents the core weakness.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

**Why Not Used:** CWE-668 is too high-level and describes the consequence rather than the root cause. The core issue is the missing validation, not the exposure per se.

## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.

**Why Not Used:** Too abstract; the problem isn't the resource lifetime, but the initial improper validation.

## CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an externally controlled name or reference that resolves to a resource that is outside of the intended control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

**Why Used:** While the primary issue is lack of validation, this CWE captures the use of an externally controlled URL that leads to a resource outside of the intended control sphere (the default browser). It is a secondary issue stemming from the **lack of validation**.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why Not Used:** This CWE doesn't fit because the application isn't making a *security decision* based on the URL. Instead, it is directly processing the URL without adequate validation.

## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is "asymmetric."

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

**Why Not Used:** Resource consumption isn't the primary issue; the core problem is the **lack of validation**.

## CWE-669: Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly transfer a resource/behavior to another sphere, or improperly imports a resource/behavior from another sphere, in a manner that provides unintended control over that resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

**Why Not Used:** The issue isn't the transfer of a resource, but the **lack of proper URL validation**, resulting in arbitrary program execution.

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

**Why Not Used:** This is not related to resource shutdown or release. The problem lies in the **lack of URL validation**.

## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why Not Used:** While opening an external program violates isolation, the root cause is still the **lack of URL validation**.

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why Not Used:** The vulnerability is about the **lack of any URL validation** rather than the equivalence of the URL to a known unsafe value.

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that
