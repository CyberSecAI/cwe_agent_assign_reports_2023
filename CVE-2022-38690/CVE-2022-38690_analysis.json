CWE-667 is a Class, while CWE-787 is a Base. Both are children of higher-level categories related to concurrency and resource management.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe662[\"CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    \n    cwe667 -->|CHILDOF| cwe662\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe787 -->|RESULT| cwe667\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe667 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n    class cwe662,cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper locking** (CWE-667), which leads to a race condition and ultimately results in **memory corruption**, specifically an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).\n  - Root Cause: **Improper Locking** (CWE-667)\n  - Weakness: **Memory Corruption** (CWE-787)\n  - Impact: Local Denial of Service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment based on the description indicates **improper locking** (CWE-667) as the primary cause of the vulnerability, which results in **memory corruption**. The vulnerability description explicitly states \"In camera driver, there is a possible **memory corruption** due to **improper locking**\".\n\nThe retriever results also support this, with CWE-667 being one of the top matches. However, the retriever also lists CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as a strong candidate due to the memory corruption aspect.\n\nThe relationship analysis shows that CWE-667 can lead to memory corruption, which can be an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). Therefore, it's reasonable to include CWE-787 as a secondary CWE, representing the specific type of memory corruption.\n\nThe final decision is to assign CWE-667 as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly identifies **improper locking** as the root cause. CWE-787 is assigned as a secondary CWE to describe the specific type of memory corruption.\n\nCWE-362, CWE-413, CWE-662, CWE-367, CWE-123, CWE-833, CWE-415, CWE-1264 were considered but not used.\n- CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')): While a race condition is possible, the description focuses on **improper locking** as the direct cause.\n- CWE-413 (Improper Resource Locking): Similar to CWE-667, but CWE-667 is broader and more applicable to the given description.\n- CWE-662 (Improper Synchronization): CWE-667 is a more specific child of CWE-662.\n- CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition): Not specific to the vulnerability description.\n- CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition): Less specific than CWE-787.\n- CWE-833 (Deadlock): No indication of a deadlock in the description.\n- CWE-415 (Double Free): Not applicable to the vulnerability description.\n- CWE-1264 (Hardware Logic with Insecure De-Synchronization between Control and Data Channels): Not applicable, as the vulnerability is in the camera driver and not related to hardware logic.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
