# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2022-24065

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-88 | Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection') | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the decision is that CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command). CWE-88 (Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command) is a peer of CWE-78 (CanAlsoBe), representing a related but subtly different weakness. The abstraction levels are considered with CWE-78 at the Base level and therefore the most specific and appropriate.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the lack of proper input sanitization of the `checkout` parameter. This leads to the ability to inject OS commands, resulting in arbitrary code execution.
  - **Root Cause:** **Improper Neutralization** of the `checkout` parameter
  - **Weakness:** **Command Injection** (CWE-78)
  - **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution

## Summary of Analysis
Initially, the vulnerability description indicates a **Command Injection** vulnerability via hg argument injection. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating, "The vulnerability is due to **improper sanitization** of the `checkout` parameter when cloning Mercurial repositories using the `cookiecutter` tool...allowing an attacker to inject additional flags." It also explicitly mentions, "The primary vulnerability is a **command injection**. By providing a malicious string as the `checkout` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system." This is strong evidence supporting CWE-78.

The retriever results list CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')) as the top result, but the description specifically points to OS commands, making CWE-78 a better fit.

CWE-88 (Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')) is considered as a secondary weakness, because the attacker is injecting arguments/flags rather than a full command. The fix, as noted in the CVE Reference, involves inserting "--" before the checkout parameter, which directly addresses the argument injection aspect.

The final decision is based on the evidence provided in the CVE description and supporting documentation, which clearly outlines the ability to inject OS commands through **improper sanitization** of the `checkout` parameter. CWE-78 is chosen as the primary CWE due to its specificity and alignment with the vulnerability details, with CWE-88 as a secondary candidate.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

*This CWE was not selected because it is too generic.*

## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected because it is specific to expression language statements, which are not applicable to this vulnerability.*

## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component
in another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the
intended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was considered a secondary weakness, because the attacker is injecting arguments/flags rather than a full command.*

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected because it relates to XSS vulnerabilities, not command injection.*

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected because the vulnerability doesn't stem from an incomplete list of disallowed inputs, but from the lack of sanitization.*

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected because it is not related to validating input against unsafe values.*

## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

*This CWE was not selected because it is too generic. CWE-78 is a more specific child of this CWE.*

## CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates a query intended to access or manipulate data in a data store such as a database, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that can modify the intended logic of the query.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*This CWE was not selected because it is related to SQL injection, not command injection.*
