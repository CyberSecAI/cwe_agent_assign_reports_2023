It is also a child of CWE-862, CWE-288, and CWE-424 which are more general authorization issues. CWE-639, a secondary CWE, represents a more specific case of authorization bypass, providing additional context to the vulnerability. The base-level abstraction is most appropriate for describing the specific flaw.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass\"]\n    cwe424[\"CWE-424: Improper Restriction of Security Bypass\"]\n    \n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe288\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe424\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe425 primary\n    class cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper** enforcement of authorization, leading to the ability to bypass visibility controls, and ultimately resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information through the REST API.\n  - The root cause is the **missing** authorization checks.\n  - The weakness is the bypass of visibility controls.\n  - The impact is the sensitive information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified that the Beaver Builder plugin **fails to** properly enforce visibility controls when content is retrieved via the REST API. This allows unauthenticated users to access content that should be restricted.\n\nThe selection of CWE-425 is supported by the vulnerability description, which states that attackers can **bypass the visibility controls protection mechanism via the REST API**. This aligns with CWE-425's description: **The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that visibility settings were ignored, allowing unauthorized access to content.\n\nCWE-639 is considered as a secondary CWE because the **authorization bypass** happens through a user-controlled key, where the key is used to identify the data to be accessed.\n\nBoth CWEs are at the base level of abstraction and directly address the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **improper** enforcement of authorization leading to sensitive information disclosure.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25
