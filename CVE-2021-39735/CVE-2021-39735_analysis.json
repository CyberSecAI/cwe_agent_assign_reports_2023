While there might be more specific Base-level CWEs related to race conditions, CWE-362 adequately captures the essence of the vulnerability as described. CWE-362 can precede CWE-416 (Use After Free) and CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference), suggesting potential consequences of the race condition if not handled properly. The extended description of CWE-362 mentions exclusivity and atomicity, which align with the race condition scenario.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe415[\"CWE-415: Double Free\"]\n    cwe662[\"CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\"]\n\n    cwe362 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe416\n    cwe362 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe415\n    cwe362 -->|CHILDOF| cwe662\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe416,cwe415,cwe662 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition** (CWE-362) in `gasket_alloc_coherent_memory`. The potential consequence of this **race condition** is memory corruption. It is also possible that a use-after-free (CWE-416) or double-free (CWE-415) condition may result.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-362 as the primary candidate due to the explicit mention of a **race condition** in the vulnerability description. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section also highlights \"**race condition**\" as the root cause.\n\nThe supporting evidence is based on the vulnerability description, which states: \"In gasket_alloc_coherent_memory of gasket_page_table.c, there is a possible memory corruption due to a **race condition**.\"\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-362 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-362 is at the Class level of abstraction, and the mapping guidance suggests examining child entries for a better fit. CWE-366 (Race Condition within a Thread) is a child of CWE-362 and is a Base level CWE, but the description for CWE-366 states \"If two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously...\", but the vulnerability description does not mention anything about threads specifically, so CWE-362 is more appropriate.\n\nCWE-416 and CWE-415 are included as secondary candidates since memory corruption is listed as the impact of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-415: Double Free\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
