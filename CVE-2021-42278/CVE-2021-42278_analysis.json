The primary CWE match from similar CVE descriptions is CWE-NVD-noinfo, which aligns with the insufficient evidence provided. The absence of specific root cause or weakness details prevents a more precise classification.\n\nThe decision is based almost entirely on the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and the \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" sections, which indicate a lack of available information. There is no \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section to provide further details. The selection of CWE-NVD-noinfo is the most appropriate given the limited evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
