The primary CWE, CWE-787 (**CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write**), directly reflects this.\nThe \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section lists CWE-787 as the Primary CWE Match. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" also identifies **out of bounds write** as the weakness and **missing bounds check** as the rootcause.\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this: \"In ssmr, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check.\" and lists \"Out-of-bounds write\" as the weakness and \"Missing bounds check in ssmr\" as the Root cause.\n\nThe related CWEs from \"Retriever Results\" and \"Complete CWE Specifications\" were considered. CWE-125 (**CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read**) is a peer of CWE-787, and could be a potential consequence of missing bounds check, so it was added as a secondary candidate. CWE-1284 (**CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input**) can precede CWE-787. Since the root cause is a **missing bounds check**, this CWE was added as a secondary candidate.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-787 (**CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write**) as the primary CWE is based on its direct match to the vulnerability description and supported by the provided evidence. It is at the optimal level of specificity (Base).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-680: Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation to determine how much memory to allocate, but an integer overflow can occur that causes less memory to be allocated than expected, leading to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a named chain, which combines multiple weaknesses.\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
