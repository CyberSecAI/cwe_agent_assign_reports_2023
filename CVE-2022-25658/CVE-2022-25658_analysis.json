This is supported by the vulnerability description. CWE-823 is a related CWE, representing the **incorrect pointer arithmetic** leading to an out-of-range pointer offset.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe823[\"CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe823 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe823 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe823 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Incorrect pointer arithmetic** (potentially leading to CWE-823, Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset)\n2.  **Weakness:** **Memory corruption** (CWE-787, Out-of-bounds Write)\n\nThe **incorrect pointer arithmetic** leads to an out-of-range pointer, which is then used to write data outside the intended buffer, resulting in **memory corruption**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states \"**Memory corruption** due to **incorrect pointer arithmetic**\". The retriever results also indicate that CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is the top candidate CWE.\nCWE-787 directly addresses the **memory corruption** aspect, while CWE-823 relates to the **incorrect pointer arithmetic** that caused it. The evidence directly supports the selection of CWE-787 as the primary CWE.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-823 can precede CWE-787.\nThe selection of CWE-787 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level.\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-822 (Untrusted Pointer Dereference): This CWE was considered because **incorrect pointer arithmetic** could lead to dereferencing an untrusted pointer. However, the description does not explicitly mention the pointer coming from an untrusted source, so this CWE was not selected.\n*   CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read) and CWE-124 (Buffer Underwrite): These CWEs are related to out-of-bounds access, but the description specifically mentions **memory corruption**, indicating an out-of-bounds write rather than a read or underwrite.\n*   CWE-1285 (Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input) and CWE-129 (Improper Validation of Array Index): These CWEs were considered, but the root cause is specifically **incorrect pointer arithmetic**, not the lack of validation of an index.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n## Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n### CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 1.00\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n### CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.491\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations for the resulting pointer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
