# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2022-29631

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-93 | Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The application **does not neutralize CRLF sequences** in the HTTP request, leading to the vulnerability. |
| CWE-918 | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The **CRLF injection** allows attackers to **execute Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** via a crafted TCP payload. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-93, Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection'), which is the root cause. CWE-918, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), is a potential impact of the CRLF injection. CWE-93 is a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')), indicating a broader class of injection vulnerabilities. The relationship CANPRECEDE -> CWE-117 (Improper Output Neutralization for Logs) is not relevant here.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences** (CWE-93), leading to the ability to inject arbitrary TCP payloads. This enables the attacker to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (CWE-918). The root cause is the **lack of proper encoding of the URL path, query string, and fragment**.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment and the retriever results strongly point to CWE-93 as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description clearly states "**multiple CLRF injection vulnerabilities**". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the **root cause** is the insecure handling of the URL and **lack of proper encoding, resulting in CRLF injection**. This injection then leads to the impact of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The retriever results list CWE-93 as the top candidate and CWE-918 as the fifth candidate, further supporting this assessment.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-93 accurately describes the **root cause**, which is the **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences**. CWE-918 describes the impact of the vulnerability, which is the ability to perform Server-Side Request Forgery.

**Supporting Evidence:**

*   Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: "**rootcause: multiple CLRF injection vulnerabilities**"
*   CVE Reference Links Content Summary: "**CRLF Injection:** The core vulnerability is the ability to inject Carriage Return Line Feed (CRLF) characters into the HTTP request." and "allows injection of CRLF characters (`\r\n`)"

The assessment is based on the provided evidence, the retriever results, and the understanding of CWE relationships.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Why it was not selected**: This CWE is not suitable because the vulnerability is specifically related to CRLF injection and not about validating equivalence of inputs.

## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Why it was not selected**: This is a high-level class. CWE-93 is a more specific base type that addresses the CRLF neutralization issue.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Why it was not selected**: This is a high-level class. CWE-93 is a more specific base type that addresses the CRLF neutralization issue.

## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.

**Why it was not selected**: While related, the vulnerability isn't exclusively in HTTP headers, but in the overall HTTP request construction. Also, response splitting is not explicitly indicated as the impact.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Why it was not selected**: This CWE doesn't apply because the vulnerability is not due to an incomplete list of disallowed inputs, but due to a lack of proper neutralization.

## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Why it was not selected**: This CWE is not relevant, as there is no mention of a permissive list of allowed inputs.

## CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives a complex input with multiple elements or fields that must be consistent with each other, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually consistent.

**Why it was not selected**: This CWE does not apply, as the issue is not about consistency within the input, but the presence of CRLF characters.

## CWE-1173: Improper Use of Validation Framework
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not use, or incorrectly uses, an input validation framework that is provided by the source language or an independent library.

**Why it was not selected**: The description does not indicate any usage of validation framework.

## CWE-838: Inappropriate Encoding for Output Context
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses or specifies an encoding when generating output to a downstream component, but the specified encoding is not the same as the encoding that is expected by the downstream component.

**Why it was not selected**: The vulnerability is not about using an inappropriate encoding, but about the absence of encoding of CRLF sequences.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Why it was not selected**: The description does not talk about a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input.
