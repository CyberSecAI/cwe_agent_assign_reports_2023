The application **does not neutralize CRLF sequences** in the HTTP request, leading to the vulnerability. |\n| CWE-918 | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The **CRLF injection** allows attackers to **execute Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** via a crafted TCP payload. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-93, Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection'), which is the root cause. CWE-918, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), is a potential impact of the CRLF injection. CWE-93 is a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')), indicating a broader class of injection vulnerabilities. The relationship CANPRECEDE -> CWE-117 (Improper Output Neutralization for Logs) is not relevant here.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\"]\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe93 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe918 -->>|IMPACT| cwe93\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe93 primary\n    class cwe918 secondary\n    class cwe74 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences** (CWE-93), leading to the ability to inject arbitrary TCP payloads. This enables the attacker to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (CWE-918). The root cause is the **lack of proper encoding of the URL path, query string, and fragment**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment and the retriever results strongly point to CWE-93 as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description clearly states \"**multiple CLRF injection vulnerabilities**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the **root cause** is the insecure handling of the URL and **lack of proper encoding, resulting in CRLF injection**. This injection then leads to the impact of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The retriever results list CWE-93 as the top candidate and CWE-918 as the fifth candidate, further supporting this assessment.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-93 accurately describes the **root cause**, which is the **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences**. CWE-918 describes the impact of the vulnerability, which is the ability to perform Server-Side Request Forgery.\n\n**Supporting Evidence:**\n\n*   Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: \"**rootcause: multiple CLRF injection vulnerabilities**\"\n*   CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"**CRLF Injection:** The core vulnerability is the ability to inject Carriage Return Line Feed (CRLF) characters into the HTTP request.\" and \"allows injection of CRLF characters (`\\r\\n`)\"\n\nThe assessment is based on the provided evidence, the retriever results, and the understanding of CWE relationships.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Why it was not selected**: This CWE is not suitable because the vulnerability is specifically related to CRLF injection and not about validating equivalence of inputs.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Why it was not selected**: This is a high-level class.
