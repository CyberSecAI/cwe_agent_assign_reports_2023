The vulnerability allows bypassing authorization by modifying a user-controlled key. |\n| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary CWE. The authorization check is performed, but incorrectly, allowing access to unauthorized resources. |\n| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 0.4 | Pillar | Discouraged | Considered but not as specific as CWE-639 or CWE-863. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-639, which is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), a class-level CWE, and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), a pillar-level CWE. This hierarchy indicates that the vulnerability is primarily about authorization bypass through a user-controlled key, which is a specific type of incorrect authorization and improper access control.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe639 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the following:\n1.  The application uses a **user-controlled key** for authorization.\n2.  Due to **incorrect authorization**, an attacker can modify the key to access unauthorized resources.\n3.  The result is an **authorization bypass**, allowing unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the description pointed towards CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) due to similar CVE descriptions. However, the key phrase \"**authorization bypass**\" and \"**user-controlled key**\" in the vulnerability description, along with the CVE Reference Links Content Summary describing how the code handles properties and checks for their length before using them in SQL queries, suggest that the primary weakness is related to how authorization is handled based on a user-controlled key. The Retriever Results also indicates that CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) is a strong candidate.\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary provides the root cause evidence: \"The vulnerability lies in the way the code handles properties in the `Criteria.php` file... The code uses `strlen($this->$prop)` which could lead to errors if the property is not set. The fix implemented replaces `strlen($this->$prop)` with `strlen($this->$prop ?? '')` to avoid errors when dealing with unset properties.\" This shows that by manipulating the properties, users can bypass authorization checks.\n\nCWE-639 is selected because it directly addresses the scenario where authorization is bypassed due to a **user-controlled key**. CWE-863 is also considered because the authorization check is performed but **incorrectly**. However, CWE-639 is more specific and better captures the root cause. CWE-284 is too high-level. The selection is based on the principle of choosing the most specific CWE that accurately represents the weakness. The evidence supports the selection of CWE-639 as the primary CWE and CWE-863 as a secondary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-178: Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly account for differences in case sensitivity when accessing or determining the properties of a resource, leading to inconsistent results.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
