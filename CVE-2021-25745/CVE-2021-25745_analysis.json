This can lead to **CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information**, as the improperly validated path can be used to access sensitive files. The vulnerability description also suggests an authorization issue **CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization**, because a user with low privileges(create/update ingress objects) is able to access sensitive information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with the **CWE-20 Improper Input Validation** of the `path` field in the Ingress object. This allows an attacker to perform **Path Traversal**, leading to **CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information**, specifically the ingress-nginx controller's service account token. With the default configuration, this token provides access to all secrets in the cluster. This can be seen as an **CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization** because a low privilege user is able to retrieve cluster secrets.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which clearly states: \"The root cause is improper input validation in the `k8s.io/ingress-nginx` component. Specifically, the `spec.rules[].http.paths[].path` field of an Ingress object was not properly sanitized, allowing a malicious user to specify paths that can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.\" This is direct evidence supporting **CWE-20 Improper Input Validation**. The resulting exposure of the service account token is a direct consequence, making **CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information** a secondary CWE. The access to all cluster secrets due to default configuration of the ingress-nginx controller suggests **CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization** to be a tertiary issue.\n\nThe graph relationships support the classification, with **CWE-20** being a root cause that can lead to **CWE-200** and **CWE-863**. All three CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, accurately representing the vulnerability.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   **CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere**: This is a higher-level class that doesn't provide the specific root cause. The **improper input validation** is a more precise description of the **weakness**. Therefore, CWE-20 is a better choice.\n*   **CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials**: While the vulnerability leads to exposure of credentials, the root cause isn't primarily about credential protection. It's about the **lack of input validation** that allows access to those credentials.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
