# Analysis for CVE-2021-25745

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-20: Improper Input Validation | Improper Input Validation | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information | Exposure of Sensitive Information | 0.8 | Class | Secondary | Allowed |
| CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization | Incorrect Authorization | 0.6 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-20 Improper Input Validation**, as the ingress-nginx controller **fails to properly validate** the input path. This can lead to **CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information**, as the improperly validated path can be used to access sensitive files. The vulnerability description also suggests an authorization issue **CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization**, because a user with low privileges(create/update ingress objects) is able to access sensitive information.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events starts with the **CWE-20 Improper Input Validation** of the `path` field in the Ingress object. This allows an attacker to perform **Path Traversal**, leading to **CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information**, specifically the ingress-nginx controller's service account token. With the default configuration, this token provides access to all secrets in the cluster. This can be seen as an **CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization** because a low privilege user is able to retrieve cluster secrets.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary assessment is based on the provided evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which clearly states: "The root cause is improper input validation in the `k8s.io/ingress-nginx` component. Specifically, the `spec.rules[].http.paths[].path` field of an Ingress object was not properly sanitized, allowing a malicious user to specify paths that can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information." This is direct evidence supporting **CWE-20 Improper Input Validation**. The resulting exposure of the service account token is a direct consequence, making **CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information** a secondary CWE. The access to all cluster secrets due to default configuration of the ingress-nginx controller suggests **CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization** to be a tertiary issue.

The graph relationships support the classification, with **CWE-20** being a root cause that can lead to **CWE-200** and **CWE-863**. All three CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, accurately representing the vulnerability.

Other CWEs Considered:

*   **CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere**: This is a higher-level class that doesn't provide the specific root cause. The **improper input validation** is a more precise description of the **weakness**. Therefore, CWE-20 is a better choice.
*   **CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials**: While the vulnerability leads to exposure of credentials, the root cause isn't primarily about credential protection. It's about the **lack of input validation** that allows access to those credentials.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-25745

## Vulnerability Description
A security issue was discovered in ingress-nginx where a user that can create or update ingress objects can use the spec.rules[].http.paths[].path field of an Ingress object (in the networking.k8s.io or extensions API group) to obtain the credentials of the ingress-nginx controller. In the default configuration, that credential has access to all secrets in the cluster.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** obtain the credentials of the ingress-nginx controller
- **attacker:** user that can create or update ingress objects
- **product:** ingress-nginx

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-25745:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is improper input validation in the `k8s.io/ingress-nginx` component. Specifically, the `spec.rules[].http.paths[].path` field of an Ingress object was not properly sanitized, allowing a malicious user to specify paths that can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core vulnerability is the lack of proper validation of the `path` field in the Ingress object, allowing arbitrary paths to be specified.
*   **Path Traversal:** This vulnerability allows a user to potentially specify a path that leads to sensitive files, including the service account token of the ingress-nginx controller.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of the ingress-nginx controller's service account token.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The ingress-nginx controller's service account, in default configurations, has access to all secrets in the cluster. This means that the leaked token could be used to gain widespread access to sensitive data and potentially other cluster resources, allowing an attacker to add or modify data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, as an attacker with the ability to create or update ingress objects can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Ingress Object Manipulation:**  The attacker crafts a malicious Ingress object with a `path` field that points to a sensitive location, such as the service account token file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker requires only the ability to create or update Ingress objects within the Kubernetes cluster. This is considered a low privilege level.
*   **No User Interaction:** The exploitation does not require any user interaction, making it easily exploitable if the attacker has the required privileges.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `ingress-nginx` controller, specifically in how it handles the `path` field within Ingress objects.
*   The attacker can set the `path` to point to `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token` (or `/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`, as `/var/run` is a symlink to `/run` in the default ingress-nginx image), which exposes the service account token used by the ingress controller.
*   The vulnerability exists in `k8s.io/ingress-nginx` versions prior to 1.2.0.

**Mitigations:**

*   **Upgrade:** The primary mitigation is to upgrade to version 1.2.0 or later of the `k8s.io/ingress-nginx` controller.
*   **Admission Policy:** If immediate upgrading is not possible, implementing an admission policy that restricts the allowed characters in the `spec.rules[].http.paths[].path` field can also help mitigate the issue.  A suggested blocklist for `annotation-value-word-blocklist` in the ingress-nginx ConfigMap is: `load_module,lua_package,_by_lua,location,root,proxy_pass,serviceaccount,{,},',\"`

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by Gafnit Amiga.
*   There's a public discussion and awareness of the vulnerability.
*  The fix involves sanitizing the input using an internal rules file.
* The ingress-nginx controller can be configured with chroot, which can provide additional protection, however, the vulnerability is still present.
* It is advised to avoid putting sensitive info in public places such as discussion forums, or if you need to discuss, consider contacting the maintainers directly.

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

### Extended Description


When resources are released, they can be made available for reuse. For example, after memory is de-allocated, an operating system may make the memory available to another process, or disk space may be reallocated when a file is deleted. As removing information requires time and additional resources, operating systems do not usually clear the previously written information.


Even when the resource is reused by the same process, this weakness can arise when new data is not as large as the old data, which leaves portions of the old data still available. Equivalent errors can occur in other situations where the length of data is variable but the associated data structure is not. If memory is not cleared after use, the information may be read by less trustworthy parties when the memory is reallocated.


This weakness can apply in hardware, such as when a device or system switches between power, sleep, or debug states during normal operation, or when execution changes to different users or privilege levels.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-459
ChildOf -> CWE-212
CanPrecede -> CWE-201

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).

**[Maintenance]** This entry needs modification to clarify the differences with CWE-212. The description also combines two problems that are distinct from the CWE research perspective: the inadvertent transfer of information to another sphere, and improper initialization/shutdown. Some of the associated taxonomy mappings reflect these different uses.

**[Research Gap]** This is frequently found for network packets, but it can also exist in local memory allocation, files, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release
- **CVE-2003-0001:** Ethernet NIC drivers do not pad frames with null bytes, leading to infoleak from malformed packets.
- **CVE-2003-0291:** router does not clear information from DHCP packets that have been previously used




## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.

### Extended Description
Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.

### Alternative Terms

**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30275:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.




## CWE-287: Improper Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
authentification: An alternate term is "authentification", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.
AuthN: "AuthN" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authentication" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from "AuthZ," which is an abbreviation of "authorization." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.
AuthC: "AuthC" is used as an abbreviation of "authentication," but it appears to used less frequently than "AuthN."

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).




## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

### Extended Description


Resources such as files and directories may be inadvertently exposed through mechanisms such as insecure permissions, or when a program accidentally operates on the wrong object. For example, a program may intend that private files can only be provided to a specific user. This effectively defines a control sphere that is intended to prevent attackers from accessing these private files. If the file permissions are insecure, then parties other than the user will be able to access those files.


A separate control sphere might effectively require that the user can only access the private files, but not any other files on the system. If the program does not ensure that the user is only requesting private files, then the user might be able to access other files on the system.


In either case, the end result is that a resource has been exposed to the wrong party.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-664

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.
**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** A "control sphere" is a set of resources and behaviors that are accessible to a single actor, or a group of actors. A product's security model will typically define multiple spheres, possibly implicitly. For example, a server might define one sphere for "administrators" who can create new user accounts with subdirectories under /home/server/, and a second sphere might cover the set of users who can create or delete files within their own subdirectories. A third sphere might be "users who are authenticated to the operating system on which the product is installed." Each sphere has different sets of actors and allowable behaviors.
