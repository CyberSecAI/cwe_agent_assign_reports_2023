The secondary CWE is CWE-1284 **Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input**, because the root cause is a **missing bounds check**. Thus CWE-1284 can precede CWE-125.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    \n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe125\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe1284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing bounds check** (CWE-1284), which leads to an **out of bounds read** (CWE-125), resulting in remote information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-125 **Out-of-bounds Read** as the primary weakness, based on the vulnerability description stating \"there is a possible **out of bounds read** due to a **missing bounds check**.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also supports this, mentioning \"Out-of-bounds read in the `nfc_ncif_proc_ee_discover_req()` function.\" This aligns with the CWE-125 description, which states: \"The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\"\n\nThe root cause **missing bounds check** suggests that CWE-1284 **Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input** is also relevant. This is because the software does not properly validate the size or length of the input, allowing an attacker to potentially trigger an out-of-bounds read. CWE-1284's description states: \"The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.\"\n\nCWE-20 **Improper Input Validation** was considered but ultimately rejected because it is a high-level class and the more specific CWE-1284 is a better fit.\n\nThe final decision is to map the vulnerability to CWE-125 as the primary weakness, with CWE-1284 as a contributing factor, as it describes the root cause of the vulnerability. Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred. The evidence supports these mappings, and the relationship analysis clarifies the chain of events.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control

over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on

children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product

objects.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in
