The vulnerability involves a **memory leak** due to a missing release of memory, making CWE-401 the most specific and appropriate choice. CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) and CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) are related but less specific; they describe broader resource management issues, while the vulnerability description focuses on the **missing release** of allocated memory.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\"]\n    cwe772[\"CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe401 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    cwe401 -->|CHILDOF| cwe772\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe401 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a bug in the goroutine handling of terminal resize events. If a user's process fails to launch, the goroutine becomes stuck, leading to a **memory leak** because the allocated memory for the goroutine is never released. This **missing release** of memory results in uncontrolled resource consumption, eventually leading to host memory exhaustion.\n  - **Root Cause:** Bug in goroutine handling of terminal resize events\n  - **Weakness:** CWE-401 Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\n  - **Impact:** Host memory exhaustion (Denial of Service)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified several candidate CWEs, including CWE-401, CWE-770, and CWE-400. The primary choice, CWE-401, is based on the **root cause evidence** that the vulnerability involves a **missing release** of memory, as explicitly stated in the vulnerability description and CVE reference links. The description states, \"If the users process fails to launch due to, for example, a faulty command, the goroutine will be stuck waiting to send without a receiver, resulting in a **memory leak**.\" This aligns directly with CWE-401's description: \"The product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.\"\n\nCWE-770 and CWE-400 were considered because the **memory leak** leads to resource consumption. However, they are less specific; the core issue is the **failure to release** the memory, not the allocation itself, making CWE-401 the more precise mapping. The graph relationships support this decision, as CWE-401 is a variant of more general resource management CWEs, indicating a more specific case of resource mismanagement.\n\nThe selection of CWE-401 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **missing release** of memory, which is the **root cause** of the vulnerability. This is a variant-level CWE, which is preferred for root cause mappings.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
