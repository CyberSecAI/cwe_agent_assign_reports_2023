CWE-441 is a Class-level weakness describing an unintended proxy or intermediary, which relates to the architecture of the vulnerable system. CWE-863 describes a failure to correctly perform authorization checks.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe441[\"CWE-441: Unintended Proxy or Intermediary ('Confused Deputy')\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe610[\"CWE-610: Object Release Without Subsequent Nullification\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization Handling\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe441 -->|CHILDOF| cwe610\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe441,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **lack of control** over the forwarding of Authorization headers. This **results** in the **insertion of sensitive information** into proxied requests, potentially leading to **unauthorized access**.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Lack of control** over header forwarding.\n  - **Weakness:** CWE-201 Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data.\n  - **Impact:** Potential unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and resulting weakness. The vulnerability lies in the nestjs-proxy library's **inability to prevent the forwarding of sensitive Authorization headers** to backend services that should not receive them. This directly leads to the **potential exposure of sensitive information**, making CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) the most appropriate primary CWE.\n\nThe description states: \"This could have resulted in **sensitive information such as OAuth bearer access tokens being inadvertently exposed** to such services that should not see them.\"\n\nThe analysis considered other CWEs such as CWE-441 (Unintended Proxy or Intermediary) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), but these were determined to be secondary. CWE-441 describes a situation where a product unintentionally acts as a proxy, but the primary issue here is the exposure of sensitive data, not the proxying itself. CWE-863 involves incorrect authorization checks, but the core problem is the uncontrolled forwarding of sensitive information, which can then lead to authorization bypasses.\n\nThe final decision to prioritize CWE-201 is based on its direct relevance to the vulnerability's core mechanism: the **insertion of sensitive information** into sent data due to the **lack of control over header forwarding**. The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) as it accurately captures the nature of the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE does not apply because the vulnerability does not involve the use of weak credentials.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE does not apply because the vulnerability does not involve an incorrect implementation of an authentication algorithm.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is not the primary issue, although the exposure of the Authorization header *could* lead to weak authentication downstream.
