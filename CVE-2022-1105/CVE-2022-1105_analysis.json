CWE-863 is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), which is in turn a child of CWE-284. This hierarchical relationship suggests that while CWE-284 broadly applies, CWE-863 offers a more specific classification if the authorization check is incorrectly performed, rather than entirely missing. The relationship influenced the decision to include CWE-863 as a secondary, more descriptive CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of weaknesses begins with the **improper access control** (CWE-284) which leads to unauthorized access of pipeline analytics.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the description points directly to **improper access control**, which aligns with CWE-284. However, CWE-284 is a high-level Pillar, and the provided text and retriever results hint at more specific classifications. The retriever results suggest CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key). Given the description, it's not that authorization is entirely missing (CWE-862), but that it's incorrectly implemented, allowing unauthorized access.\n\nThe evidence for **improper access control** comes directly from the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**: \"rootcause: **improper access control**\"\n\nCWE-863 is chosen as a secondary CWE because the description states that an unauthorized user can access pipeline analytics even when public pipelines are disabled, implying that there is an authorization check, but it is **incorrect**.\n\nCWE-639 isn't chosen because there's no specific evidence that a user-controlled key is being modified to bypass authorization, although it is a possible attack vector.\n\nCWE-284 is used as the primary because the root cause is **improper access control**.\nCWE-863 is used as a secondary because the authorization check is incorrectly performed.

This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.\n- Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-284 is extremely high-level, a Pillar. Its name, \"Improper Access Control,\" is often misused in low-information vulnerability reports or by active use of the OWASP Top Ten, such as \"A01:2021-Broken Access Control\". It is not useful for trend analysis.\n**Comments:** Consider using descendants of CWE-284 that are more specific to the kind of access control involved, such as those involving authorization (Missing Authorization (CWE-862), Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863), Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource (CWE-732), etc.); authentication (Missing Authentication (CWE-306) or Weak Authentication (CWE-1390)); Incorrect User Management (CWE-286); Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints (CWE-923); etc.\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit",
