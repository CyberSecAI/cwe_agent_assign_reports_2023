## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is between CWE-1188 and its parents. CWE-1188 is a Base level CWE and a child of both CWE-1419 (All Initialization Problems) and CWE-665 (Improper Initialization). The vulnerability involves a **misconfiguration**, which stems from an **insecure default** setting for the GRUB bootloader password. This aligns with the description of CWE-1188, which focuses on resources being initialized with insecure defaults that administrators are expected to change.

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **misconfiguration** due to an **insecure default** in the Fedora CoreOS setup. This **misconfiguration** leads to the ability to bypass the GRUB password protection, allowing unauthorized booting of non-default OSTree deployments.

Root Cause: CWE-1188 Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default
Impact: Ability to bypass GRUB password and boot into older versions.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on the root cause of the vulnerability, which is a **misconfiguration**. After reviewing the provided information, the best fit appears to be CWE-1188, as it directly addresses the issue of initializing a resource (in this case, the GRUB bootloader password) with an **insecure default**.

The evidence supporting this decision comes from the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary," which states that the `sysroot.bls-append-except-default` option was not being set correctly due to an invalid conditional statement. This resulted in the `grub_users` setting not being added to the non-default BLS configuration files, effectively bypassing the password requirement.

The vulnerability description key phrases also highlights the **misconfiguration** as a key element. The selection of CWE-1188 is also supported by its "Usage: Allowed" mapping guidance.

CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function was considered as a secondary CWE because the **misconfiguration** leads to a bypass of authentication for booting non-default OSTree deployments. However, the primary issue is the **insecure default** configuration, making CWE-1188 the more appropriate primary classification.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-3675

## Vulnerability Description
Fedora CoreOS supports setting a GRUB bootloader password using a Butane config. When this feature is enabled, GRUB requires a password to access the GRUB command-line, modify kernel command-line arguments, or boot non-default OSTree deployments. Recent Fedora CoreOS releases have a **misconfiguration** which allows booting non-default OSTree deployments without entering a password. This allows someone with access to the GRUB menu to boot into an older version of Fedora CoreOS, reverting any security fixes that have recently been applied to the machine. A password is still required to modify kernel command-line arguments and to access the GRUB command line.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **misconfiguration**
- **impact:** boot non-default OSTree deployments without password
- **product:** Fedora CoreOS
- **version:** recent releases

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-3675:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A misconfiguration in recent Fedora CoreOS releases, specifically in how the `sysroot.bls-append-except-default` option was being set within the OSTree configuration. The conditional statement used to set the `sysroot.bls-append-except-default` option in `coreos-assembler` was invalid, causing the option to not be set in affected builds. This option is responsible for restricting the boot of non-default OSTree deployments to only authorized users, by specifying the `grub_users` parameter in the BLS configuration files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect configuration of the `sysroot.bls-append-except-default` option, which controls access to non-default OSTree deployments via GRUB.
- The conditional statement in `coreos-assembler` that was supposed to set the `sysroot.bls-append-except-default` value failed due to invalid syntax.
- Consequently, the `grub_users` setting was not being added to the non-default BLS configuration files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with access to the GRUB menu can bypass the GRUB password protection and boot into non-default OSTree deployments (older versions of Fedora CoreOS) without providing the required password. This allows the attacker to bypass security fixes applied to the system.
- The attacker cannot modify kernel command-line arguments or access the GRUB command line without the correct password.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Physical access to the system or access to the GRUB menu through other means, such as a remote console.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to access the GRUB menu during system boot.
- A basic knowledge of how to navigate the GRUB menu to select a non-default deployment is also required.

**Affected Releases**
- `stable` 36.20220820.3.0 and later
- `testing` 36.20220906.2.0 and later
- `next` 36.20220906.1.0 and later

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in the following releases:
  - `stable` 36.20221014.3.0 (new machines), 36.20221030.3.0 (existing machines)
  - `testing` 36.20221030.2.0 (new and existing machines)
  - `next` 37.20221031.1.0 (new and existing machines)
- A manual fix for affected machines involves running the commands:
  ```
  sudo ostree config set sysroot.bls-append-except-default 'grub_users=""'
  sudo unshare -mw /boot/loader/entries bash -c \
  'mount -o rw,remount /boot &&
  for f in $(ls -v ostree-*-fedora-coreos.conf | head -n -1); do
      if ! grep -q grub_users "$f"; then
          echo grub_users "" >> "$f";
      fi;
  done'
  ```
- A service was added to retroactively fix the `grub_users` setting on first boot after an upgrade if an affected release is detected. This migration script was removed after a barrier release.

**Additional Details**

The content provides more detail than the official CVE description, including:

- Specific affected and fixed versions of Fedora CoreOS.
- Manual commands to mitigate the issue.
- Explanation of the problematic conditional statement in `coreos-assembler`.
- Information regarding a migration script added to address the vulnerability.

## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component
in another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the
intended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.

### Extended Description


When creating commands using interpolation into a string, developers may assume that only the arguments/options that they specify will be processed. This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.

- **CVE-2001-0150:** Web browser executes Telnet sessions using command line arguments that are specified by the web site, which could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.




## CWE-1193: Power-On of Untrusted Execution Core Before Enabling Fabric Access Control
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product enables components that contain untrusted firmware before memory and fabric access controls have been enabled.

### Extended Description


 After initial reset, System-on-Chip (SoC) fabric access controls and other security features need to be programmed by trusted firmware as part of the boot sequence. If untrusted IPs or peripheral microcontrollers are enabled first, then the untrusted component can master transactions on the hardware bus and target memory or other assets to compromise the SoC boot firmware.

## CWE-322: Key Exchange without Entity Authentication
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product performs a key exchange with an actor without verifying the identity of that actor.

### Extended Description
Performing a key exchange will preserve the integrity of the information sent between two entities, but this will not guarantee that the entities are who they claim they are. This may enable an attacker to impersonate an actor by modifying traffic between the two entities. Typically, this involves a victim client that contacts a malicious server that is impersonating a trusted server. If the client skips authentication or ignores an authentication failure, the malicious server may request authentication information from the user. The malicious server can then use this authentication information to log in to the trusted server using the victim's credentials, sniff traffic between the victim and trusted server, etc.

### Alternative Terms

## CWE-287: Improper Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
authentification: An alternate term is "authentification", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.
AuthN: "AuthN" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authentication" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from "AuthZ," which is an abbreviation of "authorization." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.
AuthC: "AuthC" is used as an abbreviation of "authentication," but it appears to used less frequently than "AuthN."

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).




## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data

## CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure.

### Extended Description


Developers often choose default values that leave the product as open and easy to use as possible out-of-the-box, under the assumption that the administrator can (or should) change the default value. However, this ease-of-use comes at a cost when the default is insecure and the administrator does not change it.


### Alternative Terms
