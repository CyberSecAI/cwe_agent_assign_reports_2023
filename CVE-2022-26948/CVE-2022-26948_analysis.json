Matches the **insecure credential storage** rootcause. |\n| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. Addresses the **insecure credential storage** and aligns with the description of storing sensitive information in cleartext. |\n| CWE-257 | Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. Addresses the **insecure credential storage**, although \"recoverable\" is less precise than \"plaintext\". |\n| CWE-522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | 0.5 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary candidate. A more general class of the vulnerability. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-256, a Base level weakness, which is a child of CWE-522, a Class level weakness. The vulnerability description focuses on **insecure credential storage**, with a clear indication of the credentials being stored in a way that allows unauthorized access. CWE-256 specifically deals with passwords stored in plaintext, which is the most direct and specific match, thus a base level. CWE-312, while also relevant, is more general, covering cleartext storage of any sensitive information. Therefore, CWE-256 is more precise. CWE-257 addresses recoverable format, which is less specific than plaintext.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe257[\"CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe257 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe257 -- PEEROF --> cwe256\n    cwe257 -- PEEROF --> cwe312\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe312,cwe257 secondary\n    class cwe522 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of the vulnerability is as follows:\n1.  Root Cause: **Insecure credential storage** (CWE-256).\n2.  Impact: A malicious attacker may obtain access to credential information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis identified that the root cause of the vulnerability is the **insecure credential storage**, leading to the potential for a malicious attacker to obtain access to credential information.\n\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-256, which directly addresses the **plaintext storage of a password**. The evidence from the vulnerability description clearly states **insecure credential storage**, which aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-256.\n\nThe graph relationships indicate that CWE-256 is a child of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials). While CWE-522 is a broader category, CWE-256 provides a more specific classification. Other considered CWEs, such as CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) and CWE-257 (Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format), were deemed less precise than CWE-256, since the vulnerability description implies direct plaintext storage.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-256 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the root cause presented in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
