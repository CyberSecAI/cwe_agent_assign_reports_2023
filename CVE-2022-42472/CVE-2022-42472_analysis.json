This hierarchical relationship indicates that CWE-113 is a specific type of CRLF Injection that leads to HTTP Request/Response Splitting. The 'CanPrecede' relationship to CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting) suggests that successful exploitation of CWE-113 can potentially lead to XSS attacks.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe436[\"CWE-436: Unspecified Behavior\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe113 -->|ChildOf| cwe93\n    cwe113 -->|ChildOf| cwe20\n    cwe113 -->|ChildOf| cwe436\n    cwe113 -->|CanPrecede| cwe79\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe113 primary\n    class cwe93,cwe20,cwe436,cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers**. This leads to **HTTP response splitting**, which can then allow an attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and potentially perform further attacks such as XSS.\n  - **Root Cause:** Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers (CWE-113)\n  - **Impact:** HTTP Response Splitting\n  - **Potential Secondary Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which includes the vulnerability description explicitly mentioning the **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers** and the resulting **HTTP response splitting**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further reinforces this by stating the root cause and weaknesses present.\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-113 is the most specific and appropriate CWE for this vulnerability, as it directly addresses the improper handling of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers.\n\nThe selection of CWE-113 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately describes the vulnerability's root cause and aligns with the provided evidence and MITRE's mapping guidance.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
