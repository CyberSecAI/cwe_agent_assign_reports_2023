CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is a Class-level CWE, and while it is encouraged to find more specific Base or Variant-level CWEs, in this case, the provided information is limited, and CWE-862 accurately captures the **missing permission check**. CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is a Base level CWE and is related to the impact of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe665[\"CWE-665: Improper Control of Resource Usage\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe665\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284,cwe400,cwe665 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing permission check** (CWE-862) which leads to a local denial of service. While the exact mechanism of the denial of service isn't detailed, a plausible scenario could involve uncontrolled resource allocation. Thus:\n\nCWE-862 (Missing Authorization) -> Potential Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-770) -> Local Denial of Service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary weakness is the **missing permission check**, which directly aligns with CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). The description clearly states this **missing permission check** leads to a local denial of service, making CWE-862 the most appropriate primary CWE.\n\nThe evidence is strong, as the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section explicitly identifies \"**missing permission check**\" as the root cause.\n\nWhile the denial of service aspect could potentially involve other CWEs, such as CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption), the description doesn't provide enough detail to confirm the exact mechanism. It is possible that the lack of authorization allows an attacker to consume resources without limit, leading to the denial of service. Therefore, I am including CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) as a secondary candidate, though with lower confidence.\n\nCWE-862 is the optimal level of specificity given the provided information.
