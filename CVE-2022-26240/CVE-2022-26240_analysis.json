It has a ChildOf relationship to CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere). CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions) is a Base-level CWE and is a ChildOf CWE-732.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe276[\"CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions\"]\n    \n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe276 -->|CHILDOF| cwe732\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe732 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe668,cwe276 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect default privileges** assigned to the running service, leading to the ability for non-privileged users to **overwrite and manipulate executables and libraries**, ultimately granting them unauthorized **access to sensitive data**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment points to CWE-732 as the primary weakness, stemming from the **incorrect permission assignment** that allows unauthorized modification of critical resources. This is supported by the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" which mentions \"**default privileges for running service**\" and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which states \"Incorrect file permissions set by Remisol Advance during installation.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also mentions \"The software sets permissions that allow non-privileged users to overwrite or manipulate executables and libraries used by a service running as SYSTEM.\".\nCWE-732 is selected because the core issue is the improper assignment of permissions to critical resources, allowing unintended actors to modify them.\n\nCWE-276 was considered as a secondary weakness. CWE-276 directly addresses the **incorrect setting of file permissions during installation**. While CWE-732 is a broader category, CWE-276 is more specific to the root cause described in the CVE details. Since the root cause mentioned in the CVE details is an issue with \"incorrect file permissions set during installation\", it is logical to consider CWE-276 as a contributing factor.\n\nThe decision to prioritize CWE-732 as the primary weakness stems from the summary which states that \"**default privileges for running service** allows non-privileged users to overwrite and manipulate executables and libraries and access sensitive data\". This description aligns more closely with the broader scope of CWE-732, which encompasses the overall problem of incorrect permission assignments for critical resources, even if the underlying cause is related to default settings during installation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
