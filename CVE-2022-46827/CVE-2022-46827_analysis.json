Additionally, the close relationship between CWE-611 (XXE) and CWE-918 (SSRF) was considered.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe611[\"CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\"]\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe610[\"CWE-610: Improper Handling of Special Elements\"]\n    \n    cwe611 -->|CHILDOF| cwe610\n    cwe918 -->|PEEROF| cwe611\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe611 primary\n    class cwe918 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **XXE attack** (CWE-611), which allows an attacker to control XML entities and their resolution. This leads to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (CWE-918), enabling the attacker to make requests to unintended destinations via custom plugin repositories.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly indicates that CWE-611 (Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference) is the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions an \"**XXE attack**\" leading to SSRF.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is: \"In JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA before 2022.3 an **XXE attack** leading to SSRF via requests to custom plugin repositories was possible.\"\n\nCWE-611 directly aligns with this description, as it involves the **improper restriction** of XML external entities, enabling an attacker to force the application to embed incorrect documents. The retriever results also ranked CWE-611 as the top match with a score of 0.800.\n\nCWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)) is a secondary weakness because the **XXE attack** leads to SSRF. The application makes requests to custom plugin repositories, which can be controlled by an attacker due to the **XXE attack**, resulting in the SSRF.\n\nThe selection of CWE-611 and CWE-918 is at the optimal level of specificity, as both are Base-level CWEs that accurately describe the root cause and consequence of the vulnerability.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n*   CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')): While XSS involves improper neutralization, the vulnerability description explicitly mentions XXE, making CWE-611 a more accurate fit.\n*   CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')): Path Traversal is not the primary issue; the issue is the XXE that allows for SSRF.\n*   CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')): The **XXE attack** does not directly involve code injection; it's about embedding incorrect documents, making CWE-611 a better fit.",
