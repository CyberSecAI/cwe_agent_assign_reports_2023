CWE-120, Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow'), is also a ChildOf CWE-119. The selection of CWE-121 is based on the explicit mention of \"stack-based buffer overflow\" in the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input\"]\n\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe120,cwe787 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **stack-based buffer overflow** due to the use of `sprintf` without input size validation when copying command parameters into a fixed-size stack buffer. This leads to the ability to overwrite the stack and execute arbitrary code, resulting in arbitrary command execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly states that there is a **stack-based buffer overflow** in the `DetranCLI` command parsing functionality.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"Several **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerabilities exist in the DetranCLI command parsing functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. A specially-crafted network packet can lead to arbitrary command execution.\"\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary provides further evidence: \"The vulnerability is caused by a **stack-based buffer overflow** in the `DetranCLI` command parsing functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. Specifically, the `sprintf` function is used to copy command parameters into a fixed-size stack buffer without checking the size of the input, resulting in a buffer overflow if the input is too long.\"\n\nGiven the explicit mention of \"**stack-based buffer overflow**\" and the technical details aligning with this type of vulnerability, CWE-121 is the most specific and appropriate CWE.\n\nCWE-120 was considered because it is often associated with buffer overflows, but CWE-121 is more specific as the buffer is on the stack. The retriever results also indicate CWE-120 as a top match. I am including CWE-120 as a secondary candidate.\n\nCWE-787 was considered because it is the parent of CWE-121 and is a general out-of-bounds write. I am including CWE-787 as a secondary candidate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n##
