This then results in a **heap-based buffer overflow** (CWE-122) when data is written into the undersized buffer. CWE-190 can precede CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), and CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), which is a child of CWE-119. The chain illustrates how a mathematical error leads to memory corruption.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe122 secondary\n    class cwe119,cwe787 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) when calculating the size of a heap buffer. This results in an **incorrect calculation of buffer size** and leads to an undersized buffer being allocated. Subsequently, when data is written to this undersized buffer, a **heap-based buffer overflow** (CWE-122) occurs, leading to potential code execution.\n\nCWE-190 (Integer Overflow) -> Incorrect Buffer Size Calculation -> CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) -> Code Execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, which clearly indicates an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) as the root cause and a subsequent **heap-based buffer overflow** (CWE-122) as the resulting vulnerability. The vulnerability description key phrases and CVE reference links content summary directly support this assessment. The graph relationships confirm that CWE-190 can lead to memory corruption issues like CWE-122. The selection of CWE-190 and CWE-122 are at the optimal level of specificity as they accurately represent the root cause and the resulting vulnerability, respectively.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
