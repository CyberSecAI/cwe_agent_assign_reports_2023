The retriever results also list CWE-862 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-862 is a Class-level CWE, and the mapping guidance suggests reviewing child CWEs for a better fit. However, the description explicitly mentions a **missing permission check**, making CWE-862 the most appropriate choice.\n\nCWE-285 **Improper Authorization** was considered as a parent of CWE-862, but it is less specific since it covers all types of authorization failures, not just missing checks. Therefore, CWE-862 is the optimal level of specificity.\n\nThe evidence for the **missing permission check** is found in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community.

This allows unintended access to functionality or data.\n\nThere are many factors that can contribute to improper authorization. The product may not use an authentication mechanism at all (see CWE-306). The product may use an authentication mechanism, but it does not prevent an attacker from bypassing it (see CWE-287). The product might not perform any authorization checks after authentication (see CWE-862). The product might not use the correct information to perform the authorization check (see CWE-863). The product might perform the check but then allow the attacker to perform actions that violate the authorization scheme (see CWE-275). The product might not properly invalidate authorization upon logout (see CWE-384).\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community.

Authentication is the process of verifying that someone is who they claim to be.
