This hierarchical relationship suggests that while the vulnerability involves a memory buffer issue (CWE-119), the more specific problem is writing outside the buffer's boundaries (CWE-787). CWE-20 **Improper Input Validation** is related as a cause since it could allow the attacker to write outside the intended boundaries.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe119 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Input Validation** (CWE-20), which leads to **Out-of-bounds Write** (CWE-787), resulting in **Memory Corruption** as described in the vulnerability description.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified a \"**memory corruption** issue\" due to \"**insufficient input validation**\". The final assessment concludes that CWE-787 **Out-of-bounds Write** is the most appropriate primary CWE because it directly reflects the **memory corruption** caused by writing outside the intended buffer. The description mentions \"improved input validation,\" suggesting that the root cause involves how input is handled, and this relates to the **Out-of-bounds Write** issue.\n\nThe retriever results strongly support CWE-787, with a score of 1.000. The retriever also suggests CWE-119 **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer** and CWE-20 **Improper Input Validation**, but these are more general. CWE-787 is more specific and accurately describes the nature of the **memory corruption**.\n\nThe decision is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the retriever results. The graph relationships confirm that CWE-787 is a specific type of CWE-119, making it a more precise classification. CWE-787 is at the base level of abstraction, which is preferred.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
