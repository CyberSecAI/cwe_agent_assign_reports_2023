CWE-281 and CWE-732 are related to permission issues and could be contributing factors. CWE-732 is a Class, and its children CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) could also be considered, but CWE-732 itself seems more relevant given the context of permission assignment.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe548[\"CWE-548: Exposure of Information Through Directory Listing\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe281[\"CWE-281: Improper Preservation of Permissions\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe548 -->|CHILDOF| cwe497\n    cwe281 -->|CHILDOF| cwe732\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe732\n    cwe668 -->|CHILDOF| cwe732\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe548 primary\n    class cwe281,cwe732 secondary\n    class cwe497,cwe285,cwe668 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe **root cause** is that the **hidden property is not cascaded to children of the Home folder**, leading to the **impact** of an attacker gaining a complete index of all resources via directory listing. This is a fairly direct chain.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary focus is on the exposure of information due to a directory listing vulnerability. The analysis relies heavily on the provided vulnerability description and key phrases.\n\n*   The vulnerability description explicitly states that the **hidden property is not cascaded to children of Home folder**, which leads to a directory listing that exposes the complete index of all resources.\n*   The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**attacker can get complete index of all resources**\".\n*   CWE-548 (Exposure of Information Through Directory Listing) directly matches the **impact** described in the vulnerability.\n*   CWE-281 (Improper Preservation of Permissions) is considered as a secondary CWE because the root cause indicates that the **hidden property is not cascaded**, which could be related to how permissions are preserved.\n*   CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) is also considered as a secondary CWE because the core issue is that the **hidden property is not cascaded**, which implies an incorrect assignment of permissions.\n\nThe selection of CWE-548 as the primary CWE is based on its direct relevance to the vulnerability description, which explicitly states the exposure of information through a directory listing. The other CWEs were considered because the **root cause** involves how permissions are handled, but they are less direct matches.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
