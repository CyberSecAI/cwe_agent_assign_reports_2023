CWE-36, Absolute Path Traversal, is a child of CWE-22 and represents a specific type of path traversal using absolute paths. CWE-73, External Control of File Name or Path, represents the broader issue of allowing user input to control file paths, which can lead to path traversal. The selection of CWE-22 as primary is due to its general applicability to the vulnerability, while CWE-36 and CWE-73 provide additional context about the specific type of path traversal and the source of the malicious input.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe36[\"CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    \n    cwe36 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe22\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe36,cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with external control over the file path (CWE-73). The lack of proper validation of this path (CWE-22) then allows an attacker to use absolute path sequences (CWE-36) to access files outside the intended directory.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **absolute path traversal** as the key weakness. The provided evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the root cause is the unsafe use of the `flask.send_file` function, which allows attackers to perform **absolute path traversal** due to **improper limitation of pathname** to a restricted directory. This aligns well with CWE-22. The retriever results also highly suggest CWE-22, CWE-36, and CWE-73.\n\nThe selection of CWE-22 as the primary CWE is based on its general description of path traversal vulnerabilities. CWE-36 is included as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability specifically involves absolute path traversal. CWE-73 is also included because the vulnerability involves external control of the file path, which is a prerequisite for path traversal.\n\nThe CWEs selected are at the Base level of abstraction, which is considered the preferred level for mapping vulnerabilities. This provides a balance between specificity and generality, allowing for a clear understanding of the vulnerability without being overly specific.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\nThe following CWEs
