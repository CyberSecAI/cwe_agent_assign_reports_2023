While it would be preferable to identify a Base or Variant level CWE, the vulnerability description clearly states a \"**missing permission check**\", aligning directly with the definition of missing authorization. CWE-862 is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), but these are too general to be useful in this case. CWE-223 is also a possibility because the **missing permission check** means security relevant information is being ommitted but that is an impact of the **missing permission check** itself, and therefore secondary.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe223[\"CWE-223: Omission of Security-relevant Information\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe223 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission check** (CWE-862), which directly leads to local information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates a **missing permission check** in the PackageManager, which allows unauthorized access to information about installed packages. This directly maps to CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision is:\n\n*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** \"**missing permission check**\"\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** \"The vulnerability lies within the Framework component of Android...An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information.\"\n\nWhile the ideal mapping would be to a Base or Variant level CWE, CWE-862 accurately captures the root cause of the vulnerability. The retriever results list CWE-862 as the top candidate with a score of 0.475.\n\nCWE-223 (Omission of Security-relevant Information) was considered because the **missing permission check** results in security-relevant information not being properly protected. However, this is a consequence of the **missing authorization**, not the primary cause. Therefore, CWE-862 is the more accurate primary mapping.",
