Usage: Discouraged, but applicable as a high-level classification. |\n| CWE-917 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection') | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | The vulnerability involves the injection of a malicious hostname, potentially leading to the execution of unintended expressions if the hostname is used in an expression language statement. |\n| CWE-113 | Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting') | 0.5 | Variant | Secondary | This CWE is related as HTTP headers are being manipulated. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe analysis considered the following CWE relationships:\n  - Parent-child hierarchical relationships: CWE-74 is a parent of CWE-93 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences) and CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code).\n  - Chain relationships showing progression of vulnerability: The **Host header injection** can lead to redirection of users to malicious websites, which can further lead to phishing attacks or session hijacking.\n  - Peer relationships that offered alternative classifications: CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) was considered but deemed less specific than CWE-74.\n  - How abstraction levels influenced your selection: CWE-74 was chosen as a Class-level CWE, providing a broader categorization of the injection vulnerability, while also considering more specific Base-level CWEs like CWE-917.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe917[\"CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\"]\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    \n    cwe917 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe93\n    cwe93 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe74 primary\n    class cwe917,cwe113 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of root cause and weaknesses for the Vulnerability Description is:\n  - **Root Cause:** **Host header injection** due to misconfiguration in Apache HTTP Server (`RedirectMatch` directive).\n  - Weakness: **Improper neutralization** of special elements in output (CWE-74).\n  - Impact: Redirection of users to malicious websites, potentially leading to phishing attacks or session hijacking.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **Host header injection**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" indicates that the root cause is a misconfiguration in the default Apache HTTP Server configuration of Polarion ALM, where the `RedirectMatch` directive is not properly configured, allowing an attacker to inject a malicious hostname.\n\nThe primary CWE chosen is CWE-74 because it broadly covers the **improper neutralization** of special elements in output that are used by a downstream component. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the **Host header injection** allows an attacker to spoof the Host header information and redirect users to malicious websites. This aligns well with the description of CWE-74, which states that the product constructs a command or data structure using externally influenced input but does not neutralize special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted.\n\nCWE-917 was considered as a secondary CWE because it refers to **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an expression language statement. If the injected hostname is used in an expression language statement, this CWE would be relevant.\n\nCWE-113 was also considered because the Host header is part of HTTP headers, and **improper neutralization** of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers could lead to HTTP request/response splitting.\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) was considered but deemed less specific because the core issue is the **improper neutralization** of special elements rather than a general lack of input validation.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-74 as the primary CWE is justified because it directly addresses the **improper neutralization** of special elements in the Host header, leading to the redirection of users to malicious websites. It is at the optimal level of specificity, providing a broad categorization of the injection vulnerability while also being supported by the evidence in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- The evidence for selecting CWE-74 comes from the vulnerability description: \"The affected application contains a **Host header injection** vulnerability that could allow an attacker to spoof a Host header information and redirect users to malicious websites.\"\n- The evidence for the root cause comes from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\": \"A misconfiguration in the default Apache HTTP Server configuration of Polarion ALM. Specifically, the `RedirectMatch` directive is not properly configured to include the hostname, allowing an attacker to inject a malicious hostname.\"",
