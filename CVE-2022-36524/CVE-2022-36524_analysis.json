It is a child of CWE-1391 (Use of Weak Credentials), which is a Class level CWE. CWE-259 and CWE-321 are variants of CWE-798. The relationship analysis indicates that CWE-1392 is the most appropriate base level CWE for this vulnerability, with CWE-259 and CWE-798 being potential alternative or related CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1392[\"CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe1392 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1391\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1392 primary\n    class cwe259,cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **rootcause** of **static default credentials** being used in the D-Link GO-RT-AC750 router. The impact is that attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to the device.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability involves the use of **static default credentials** in a D-Link router, as indicated by the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\". The retriever results also highlight CWE-1392 (Use of Default Credentials), CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password), and CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) as potential matches. Given the **rootcause** identified, CWE-1392 is the most accurate representation of the vulnerability because it directly addresses the use of default credentials. While CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) and CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) are related, they are more specific. CWE-259 is a variant that focuses specifically on hard-coded passwords, and CWE-798 encompasses hard-coded credentials in general.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
