While CWE-303 is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability's root cause, understanding its relationship to the broader categories of authentication failures helps provide context.

This leads to the ability for a high-privileged user to **get other users tokens to another resource**, resulting in unauthorized access and potential information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **Incorrect implementation in authentication protocol** as the root cause, which strongly suggested CWE-303. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions this CWE.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-303 as the top candidate.\n\nGiven the direct evidence and the retriever results, CWE-303 is the most appropriate and specific choice.\n\nCWE-287 and CWE-1390 were considered but not chosen as the primary CWE because they are broader and less descriptive of the specific **incorrect implementation** issue. While related, they represent higher-level classifications that do not capture the nuance of the vulnerability. CWE-668 was also considered, but it focuses on the exposure of resources to the wrong sphere, which is a consequence of the authentication failure rather than the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-287: Improper Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 4673.42\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nWhen an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable.
