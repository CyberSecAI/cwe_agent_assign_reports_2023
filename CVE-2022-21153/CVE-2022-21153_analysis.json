More specific children should be considered |\n| CWE-926 | Improper Export of Android Application Components | 0.70 | Variant | Allowed | A more specific child of the suggested alternatives to CWE-284 |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is the parent-child relationship. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) is a high-level Pillar, while CWE-926 (Improper Export of Android Application Components) is a more specific Variant. The relationship dictates that if more specific information is available, a Variant should be preferred over a Pillar.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe926[\"CWE-926: Improper Export of Android Application Components\"]\n    \n    cwe926 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe926 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Access Control** (CWE-284) which leads to information disclosure. The **Improper Access Control** is the root cause. The specific mechanism by which access control is bypassed involves the Android application component export, refining the root cause to CWE-926.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment leaned towards CWE-284 due to the vulnerability description explicitly mentioning \"**Improper Access Control**\". However, the MITRE mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-284 because it is a high-level Pillar, suggesting more specific descendants should be considered. The vulnerability description indicates that an authenticated user can potentially enable information disclosure via local access in the Intel(R) Capital Global Summit Android application. With local access, the vulnerability specifically lies in how Android application components are exported. The summary of the CVE reference links mentions, \"**Root cause of vulnerability**: **Improper access control** in the Intel(R) Capital Global Summit Android application.\" The retriever results list CWE-926 (Improper Export of Android Application Components) as a Variant and a more specific cause of the vulnerability. The final decision is to map to CWE-284 and CWE-926. CWE-284 is included to capture the high-level **Improper Access Control**, while CWE-926 captures the specific Android application component export issue. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity given the provided information, with CWE-926 being a Variant, and a child of the broader Pillar CWE-284.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary.
