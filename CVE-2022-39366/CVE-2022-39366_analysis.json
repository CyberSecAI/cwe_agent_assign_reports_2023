CWE-347 is a child of CWE-345 **Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity**, highlighting a broader category of data verification issues. The choice of CWE-347 is based on its precise description of the vulnerability, aligning with the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    \n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    cwe347 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe287,cwe345 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper verification of the cryptographic signature** (CWE-347), which directly leads to the ability to bypass authentication (CWE-287) and gain unauthorized access. The chain clearly shows the progression from the root cause to the impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified that the `StatelessTokenService` of the DataHub metadata service **does not verify the signature of JWT tokens**, leading to an authentication bypass. The primary CWE, CWE-347 **Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature**, was selected due to its precise match with the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section confirms this, stating, \"The `StatelessTokenService` in DataHub's metadata service uses the `parse` method of the `io.jsonwebtoken.JwtParser`, which does not verify the cryptographic signature of JWT tokens.\" This evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-347.\n\nCWE-287 **Improper Authentication** was considered as a secondary CWE, representing the impact of the vulnerability. However, since CWE-347 directly addresses the **root cause**, it is the more appropriate primary classification. The mapping guidance for CWE-287 discourages its use when lower-level CWE entries are applicable, further supporting the choice of CWE-347.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the connection between CWE-347 as the cause and CWE-287 as the potential impact. This understanding helped in prioritizing the root cause for the primary classification.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-347 is a Base-level CWE that directly describes the missing signature verification, while CWE-287 is a Class-level CWE that represents the resulting authentication bypass.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
