## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper verification of the cryptographic signature** (CWE-347), which directly leads to the ability to bypass authentication (CWE-287) and gain unauthorized access. The chain clearly shows the progression from the root cause to the impact.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified that the `StatelessTokenService` of the DataHub metadata service **does not verify the signature of JWT tokens**, leading to an authentication bypass. The primary CWE, CWE-347 **Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature**, was selected due to its precise match with the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section confirms this, stating, "The `StatelessTokenService` in DataHub's metadata service uses the `parse` method of the `io.jsonwebtoken.JwtParser`, which does not verify the cryptographic signature of JWT tokens." This evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-347.

CWE-287 **Improper Authentication** was considered as a secondary CWE, representing the impact of the vulnerability. However, since CWE-347 directly addresses the **root cause**, it is the more appropriate primary classification. The mapping guidance for CWE-287 discourages its use when lower-level CWE entries are applicable, further supporting the choice of CWE-347.

The graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the connection between CWE-347 as the cause and CWE-287 as the potential impact. This understanding helped in prioritizing the root cause for the primary classification.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-347 is a Base-level CWE that directly describes the missing signature verification, while CWE-287 is a Class-level CWE that represents the resulting authentication bypass.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-39366

## Vulnerability Description
DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. Prior to version 0.8.45, the `StatelessTokenService` of the DataHub metadata service (GMS) **does not verify the signature of JWT tokens**. This allows an attacker to connect to DataHub instances as any user if Metadata Service authentication is enabled. This vulnerability occurs because the `StatelessTokenService` of the Metadata service uses the `parse` method of `io.jsonwebtoken.JwtParser`, which does not perform a verification of the cryptographic token signature. This means that JWTs are accepted regardless of the used algorithm. This issue may lead to an authentication bypass. Version 0.8.45 contains a patch for the issue. There are no known workarounds.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **does not verify the signature of JWT tokens**
- **impact:** connect to DataHub instances as any user if Metadata Service authentication is enabled
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** DataHub
- **version:** Prior to version 0.8.45
- **component:** StatelessTokenService

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-39366:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2022-39366. The GitHub Security Advisory ([https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/security/advisories/GHSA-r8gm-v65f-c973](https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/security/advisories/GHSA-r8gm-v65f-c973)) explicitly mentions CVE-2022-39366 and describes the vulnerability in the `StatelessTokenService` class. The CodeQL documentation also references the same vulnerability ([https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/java/java-missing-jwt-signature-check/](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/java/java-missing-jwt-signature-check/)).

**2. Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:** The `StatelessTokenService` in DataHub's metadata service uses the `parse` method of the `io.jsonwebtoken.JwtParser`, which does not verify the cryptographic signature of JWT tokens.
*   **Weakness:** Missing JWT signature verification. The code uses `Jwts.parserBuilder().setSigningKey(key).build().parse(token)` which does not perform signature validation, and will accept a token regardless of the used signing algorithm and even if the token is not signed.
*   **Impact:** Authentication bypass. An attacker can forge JWT tokens and gain access to DataHub instances as any user, potentially gaining full control of the system if Metadata Service authentication is enabled.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Network-based attacks.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the DataHub GMS.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to create a valid JWT token with arbitrary claims, without having to know the signing key.
    *   The attacker does not need any privileges on the system.

**3. Technical Details**

The `StatelessTokenService.java` file demonstrates the vulnerable code:
```java
public TokenClaims validateAccessToken(@Nonnull final String accessToken) throws TokenException {
    Objects.requireNonNull(accessToken);
    try {
      byte [] apiKeySecretBytes = this.signingKey.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
      final String base64Key = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(apiKeySecretBytes);
      final Claims claims = (Claims) Jwts.parserBuilder()
          .setSigningKey(base64Key)
          .build()
          .parse(accessToken) // VULNERABLE CODE - Does not verify the signature
          .getBody();
    ...
    }
```
The `parse` method is used, which bypasses the signature check, instead of `parseClaimsJws`.

**4. CVSS Score and Metrics (from the advisory)**

*   **Severity:** Critical (9.9)
*   **CVSS v3 Base Metrics:**
    *   Attack vector: Network
    *   Attack complexity: Low
    *   Privileges required: None
    *   User interaction: None
    *   Scope: Changed
    *   Confidentiality: Low
    *   Integrity: High
    *   Availability: Low
*   **CVSS String:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:L

**5. Remediation:**

The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.8.45 by ensuring JWT signature verification takes place before token acceptance. The fix was not explicitly detailed in the provided materials.

**6. Additional Notes**
The CodeQL documentation provides a good explanation of the issue in `io.jsonwebtoken.jjwt` library and how to fix it.
The `parse` method is vulnerable, instead `parseClaimsJws` method should be used to verify the JWT signature.

In summary, the provided content clearly identifies a critical authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2022-39366) in DataHub due to missing JWT signature verification, which allows attackers to impersonate any user.

- **CVE-2022-30272:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) does not use signatures for firmware images and relies on insecure checksums




## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.

### Extended Description


Cryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.


It is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.


Since the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered "unsafe" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.


For a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples

**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-1270: Generation of Incorrect Security Tokens
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product implements a Security Token mechanism to differentiate what actions are allowed or disallowed when a transaction originates from an entity. However, the Security Tokens generated in the system are incorrect.

### Extended Description


Systems-On-a-Chip (SoC) (Integrated circuits and hardware engines) implement Security Tokens to differentiate and identify actions originated from various agents. These actions could be "read", "write", "program", "reset", "fetch", "compute", etc. Security Tokens are generated and assigned to every agent on the SoC that is either capable of generating an action or receiving an action from another agent. Every agent could be assigned a unique, Security Token based on its trust level or privileges. Incorrectly generated Security Tokens could result in the same token used for multiple agents or multiple tokens being used for the same agent. This condition could result in a Denial-of-Service (DoS) or the execution of an action that in turn could result in privilege escalation or unintended access.

**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.
