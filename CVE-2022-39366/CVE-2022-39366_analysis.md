| CWE-287 | Improper Authentication | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is that CWE-347 **Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature** is a specific type of flaw that can lead to CWE-287 **Improper Authentication**. CWE-347 is a child of CWE-345 **Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity**, highlighting a broader category of data verification issues. The choice of CWE-347 is based on its precise description of the vulnerability, aligning with the root cause.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper verification of the cryptographic signature** (CWE-347), which directly leads to the ability to bypass authentication (CWE-287) and gain unauthorized access. The chain clearly shows the progression from the root cause to the impact.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified that the `StatelessTokenService` of the DataHub metadata service **does not verify the signature of JWT tokens**, leading to an authentication bypass. The primary CWE, CWE-347 **Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature**, was selected due to its precise match with the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section confirms this, stating, "The `StatelessTokenService` in DataHub's metadata service uses the `parse` method of the `io.jsonwebtoken.JwtParser`, which does not verify the cryptographic signature of JWT tokens." This evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-347.

CWE-287 **Improper Authentication** was considered as a secondary CWE, representing the impact of the vulnerability. However, since CWE-347 directly addresses the **root cause**, it is the more appropriate primary classification. The mapping guidance for CWE-287 discourages its use when lower-level CWE entries are applicable, further supporting the choice of CWE-347.

The graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the connection between CWE-347 as the cause and CWE-287 as the potential impact. This understanding helped in prioritizing the root cause for the primary classification.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-347 is a Base-level CWE that directly describes the missing signature verification, while CWE-287 is a Class-level CWE that represents the resulting authentication bypass.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product communicates with a host that provides a certificate, but the product does not properly ensure that the certificate is actually associated with that host.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
