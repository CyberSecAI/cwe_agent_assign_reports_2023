CWE-288 also has a child relationship to CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function. Both the peer and child relationships influenced consideration of these alternate classifications.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n    cwe420[\"CWE-420: Unprotected Alternate Channel\"]\n    cwe1299[\"CWE-1299: Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe288 -- PEEROF --> cwe420\n    cwe288 -- CHILDOF --> cwe306\n    cwe420 -- PARENTOF --> cwe1299\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe288 primary\n    class cwe420,cwe1299 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **security feature bypass** due to a **missing** or **improper** protection mechanism on an alternate path. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended security controls and potentially execute malicious code or gain unauthorized access.\n  - Root Cause: **Security Feature Bypass**\n  - Weakness: **Missing** or **Improper** Protection on Alternate Path/Channel\n  - Impact: Potential execution of malicious code or unauthorized access\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-288 Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel because the vulnerability involves bypassing a security feature through an alternate path. The description mentions a **security feature bypass** in Windows Mark of the Web, which aligns with the concept of bypassing authentication or security controls via an alternate channel. The presence of an alternate path is implied by the **security feature bypass**, suggesting a lack of protection on this path.\n\nThe vulnerability description key phrases highlight \"**Security Feature Bypass**\" which directly supports the selection of CWE-288 because the primary weakness being exploited is the ability to circumvent the intended security mechanisms.\n\nThe retriever results also suggest considering CWE-288, further reinforcing its relevance.\n\nCWE-420 Unprotected Alternate Channel was considered because it is a peer of CWE-288 and describes a situation where an alternate communication channel lacks sufficient protection mechanisms. CWE-1299 Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface was considered because it is a parent of CWE-420.\n\nThe selection of CWE-288 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the **security feature bypass** through an alternate path, which is the core of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1263: Improper Physical Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is designed with access restricted to certain information, but it does not sufficiently protect against an unauthorized actor with physical access to these areas.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. This is often a component in phishing attacks.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product violates well-established principles for secure design.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

This makes it easier for attackers to trick users into inflicting damage to their system.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1299: Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe lack of protections on alternate paths to access\n                control-protected assets (such as unprotected shadow registers\n                and other external facing unguarded interfaces) allows an\n                attacker to bypass existing protections to the asset that are\n\t\tonly performed against the primary path.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 5750.25",
