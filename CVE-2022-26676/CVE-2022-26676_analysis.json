It has child CWEs such as CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource). CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) can follow from a permissive allowlist (CWE-183). The relationship analysis reveals that while the description points to an authorization issue, the impact involves uploading dangerous files. Selecting CWE-285 as the primary CWE aligns with the **inadequate privilege restrictions** at the API level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    cwe183[\"CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe434 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe183\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe434 secondary\n    class cwe863,cwe732,cwe183 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **inadequate privilege restrictions** (CWE-285). This leads to an unauthenticated attacker being able to upload (CWE-434) and execute malicious scripts. The root cause is the **improper authorization**, and the impact is the ability to upload and execute malicious scripts.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the root cause of the vulnerability, which is **inadequate privilege restrictions**. The description states, \"aEnrich a+HRD has **inadequate privilege restrictions**, an unauthenticated remote attacker can use the API function to upload and execute malicious scripts to control the system or disrupt service.\" This points to an authorization issue.\n\nThe retriever results listed CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) as potential candidates. Given that the primary issue is the lack of proper authorization, CWE-285 is chosen as the primary CWE. The ability to upload and execute scripts is a consequence of the authorization failure, so CWE-434 is a secondary CWE.\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-285 is a high-level class, and more specific authorization CWEs could be children. However, given the information available, CWE-285 provides the best overall classification of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-285 is selected because the vulnerability description and CVE summary clearly state an **inadequate privilege restrictions** issue. CWE-434 is selected because it is an impact of the **improper authorization**, since the attacker is able to upload and execute a malicious script. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity based on the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n*Not Selected:* This CWE focuses on the product's handling of insufficient privileges during an operation.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n*Not Selected:* While this could be applicable, it's too general and doesn't capture the specific lack of authorization.\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**",
