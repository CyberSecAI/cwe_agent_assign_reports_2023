There are also `ChildOf` relationships to CWE-825, CWE-672, and CWE-672, and `CanPrecede` relationships to CWE-120 and CWE-123, but these are less relevant for direct classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on a Resource after Expiration or Release\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n    \n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe416 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe120\n    cwe416 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe123\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe825,cwe672,cwe120,cwe123 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **use after free** condition, which leads to **heap corruption**. The impact is that a remote attacker can potentially exploit the **heap corruption** via specific and direct user interaction.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description, specifically the key phrase \"**rootcause: use after free**\" and \"**weakness: heap corruption**\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also mentions \"**Use after free**\" as the root cause.\nThe selection of CWE-416 is further supported by the \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section, which lists CWE-416 as the \"Primary CWE Match\" and the top CWE.\nThe `Retriever Results` also lists CWE-416 as the top combined result.\nCWE-416 is a Variant level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\nI considered CWE-787 as a possible match, but CWE-416 is a better fit because the description mentions a \"use after free\" condition directly.\nI considered CWE-123 as a possible match, but it is a more generic CWE than CWE-416 and doesn't describe the root cause accurately.\nI considered CWE-415 as a possible match, but it describes a double free condition, which is different from a use after free condition.\nTherefore, CWE-416 is the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n```\n## CWE-416: Use After Free\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory \"belongs\" to the code that operates on the new pointer.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDangling pointer: a pointer that no longer points to valid memory, often after it has been freed\nUAF: commonly used acronym for Use After Free\nUse-After-Free\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-825\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nCanPrecede -> CWE-120\nCanPrecede -> CWE-123\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n```",
