CWE-798 is a parent of CWE-259. The vulnerability leads to **improper authentication** (CWE-287), which is a higher-level class of weakness.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe259 primary\n    class cwe798 secondary\n    class cwe287 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause** of using a **hard-coded password** (CWE-259), leading to **improper authentication** (CWE-287), which allows a local attacker with CLI access to perform operations on the Glassfish server.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **improper authentication** vulnerability stemming from a **hardcoded password**. The Retriever Results and Complete CWE Specifications were then analyzed to determine the most appropriate CWE.\n\nThe evidence for the use of a **hard-coded password** is present in the vulnerability description: \"A **improper authentication** vulnerability ... allows a local attacker ... to perform operations on the Glassfish server directly via a **hardcoded password**.\" Further supporting evidence comes from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary which says \"The vulnerability stems from a **hardcoded password** for the Glassfish server within FortiSIEM, leading to **improper authentication**.\"\n\nCWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) is the most specific CWE, accurately representing the **root cause**. It is a Variant level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) is also relevant as a more general categorization, but CWE-259 is more precise. The use of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is discouraged by MITRE, as it is a Class level CWE, and more specific CWEs exist. I am including CWE-287 as a tertiary candidate due to the **improper authentication** description in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
