The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a \"Stack-based buffer overflow\", justifying the selection of CWE-121. Although CWE-119 has a high retriever score, it is a Class-level CWE and the mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available. CWE-787 is also more general than CWE-121.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe787,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **stack-based buffer overflow**, which leads to Denial of Service (DoS) and potential code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a **stack-based buffer overflow** exists in the SonicOS SessionID HTTP response header. This directly corresponds to CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow). The description also mentions that the attacker is a remote authenticated attacker, which is relevant to the attack vector but not the root cause. The impact is Denial of Service (DoS) and potential code execution, which are the consequences of the **buffer overflow**.\n\nThe retriever results list CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) with a high score, but the mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available. CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) which is a child of CWE-119. Since the vulnerability is explicitly a **stack-based buffer overflow**, CWE-121 is the most accurate and specific choice.\n\nThe evidence is clear and directly supports the selection of CWE-121. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-121 is the most specific and appropriate CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives a complex input with multiple elements or fields that must be consistent with each other, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually consistent.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-606: Unchecked Input for Loop Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly check inputs that are used for loop conditions, potentially leading to a denial of service or other consequences because of excessive looping.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive -
