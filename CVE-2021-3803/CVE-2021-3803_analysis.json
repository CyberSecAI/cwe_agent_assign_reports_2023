Choosing CWE-1333 offers a more specific classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n\n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe407 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity** (CWE-1333), leading to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS), and ultimately causing a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis, based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference links, points directly to **Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity**. The vulnerability description key phrases explicitly mention \"**Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity**\". The CVE reference links confirm that the root cause is a vulnerable regular expression susceptible to ReDoS attacks. The selection of CWE-1333 is precise due to its direct alignment with the **weakness** and the provided evidence. The retriever results also prioritize CWE-1333.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**:
