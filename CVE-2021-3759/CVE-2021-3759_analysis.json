CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400, making it a more specific classification. The evidence strongly suggests that the vulnerability is due to a lack of limits on resource allocation, making CWE-770 the more accurate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe770 -->|PARENTOF| cwe789\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events in this vulnerability starts with the **missing** accounting of kernel memory usage for IPC objects in the memory cgroup controller. This leads to the **allocation of resources without limits or throttling** (CWE-770), which then results in a denial-of-service due to memory exhaustion.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment was heavily influenced by the vulnerability description and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\", which clearly indicated that the root cause was the memory cgroup controller not accounting for kernel memory allocated for IPC objects. This led to a scenario where a local user could exhaust memory by repeatedly calling the semget function to create semaphores.\n\nThe key evidence supporting the selection of CWE-770 comes from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\": \"The memory cgroup controller does not account for kernel memory allocated for IPC objects\" and \"A local user can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service by exhausting the available memory\".\n\nThe retriever results suggested CWE-770 \"Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\" as a good candidate, but also listed CWE-190 \"Integer Overflow or Wraparound\" and CWE-415 \"Double Free\". However, CWE-190 doesn't fit the description as there's no evidence of integer overflow, and CWE-415 is not relevant as there's no mention of double freeing memory. CWE-770 aligns perfectly with the **missing** limits on allocating IPC objects and causing memory exhaustion.\n\nCWE-770 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level, and accurately represents the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this

wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may\n         become a very small or negative number.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read",
