## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-295, which indicates a general failure to validate a certificate. CWE-297 is a variant of CWE-295 focusing on hostname mismatch, which is a more specific type of certificate validation failure. CWE-923 is a broader class related to improper restriction of communication channels, which certificate validation aims to achieve. The hierarchical relationship influenced the decision, with CWE-295 as the core issue and CWE-297 as a potential refinement if hostname mismatch is explicitly confirmed.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to correctly check the certificate of authenticity by default** (CWE-295). This leads to a potential Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, allowing an attacker to **obtain the users credentials** (impact).

## Summary of Analysis
Initially, the vulnerability description states that the application **does not correctly check the certificate of authenticity by default**. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms this by stating, "The vulnerability stems from a **lack of default server certificate verification**...the client would connect to the server **without verifying the server's certificate**." This aligns directly with CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation).

The retriever results also show CWE-295 as the top candidate.

The relationship analysis suggests that CWE-297 (Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch) could be a more specific variant if there was evidence of a hostname mismatch issue, but the current description doesn't explicitly state this. Therefore, CWE-295 is a more appropriate base level.

CWE-923 (Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints) is a broader classification. While relevant, it's less specific than CWE-295, which directly addresses the certificate validation **weakness**.

Therefore, the primary CWE is CWE-295 due to the **lack of certificate verification**. A secondary candidate is CWE-297 if the vulnerability is specifically related to hostname mismatch. CWE-923 is also a secondary candidate as it addresses communication channel security, but it is too generic.

## Vulnerability Description
Velneo vClient on its 28.1.3 version, **does not correctly check the certificate of authenticity by default**. This could allow an attacker that has access to the network to perform a MITM attack in order to obtain the users credentials.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **does not correctly check the certificate of authenticity by default**
- **impact:** obtain the users credentials
- **vector:** MITM attack
- **attacker:** attacker that has access to the network
- **product:** Velneo vClient
- **version:** 28.1.3

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-45035:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of default server certificate verification in the VATPS protocol used by Velneo. Specifically, prior to version 29.2, the client would connect to the server without verifying the server's certificate, making it susceptible to MITM attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Certificate Verification:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of mandatory certificate verification during the initial connection phase of the VATPS protocol. This allows a malicious actor to impersonate a legitimate server.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Vulnerability:** Due to the lack of certificate verification, a MITM attacker can intercept the communication between the client and the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Sensitive data transmitted between the client and server can be intercepted and read by the attacker.
- **Integrity Violation:** The attacker can modify data in transit, potentially causing data corruption or manipulating application behavior.
- **Loss of Trust:** By impersonating the server, an attacker could potentially gain further access or control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** The attacker needs to position themselves on the network path between a Velneo client and server to intercept and manipulate traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs access to the network where the Velneo client and server are communicating.
- **Interception Capability:** The attacker must be able to intercept and modify network traffic in real time.
- **Technical Knowledge:** Requires knowledge of MITM attacks, networking, and potentially some understanding of the VATPS protocol.

**Mitigation:**
- **Upgrade:** Update all Velneo components to version 29.2 or later, where certificate verification is enabled by default.
- **Manual Configuration:** For versions prior to 29.2, manually configure clients to verify server certificates. This is also applicable to other components like Velneo vModApache and Velneo ODBC Driver
- **Use VATPS:** Ensure that the VATPS protocol is enabled for secure connections.
- **Domain Certificate:** Ensure the server is using a valid certificate that matches its domain, not the default test certificate.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is officially addressed in Velneo version 29.2 and later by enabling certificate domain verification by default.
- The vulnerability could be exploited by a MITM attack.
- The vendor has provided manual mitigations for older versions by configuring clients to verify certificates.
- INCIBE has published a notification: [CVE-2021-45035](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-45035)
- The vendor recommends to update installations to the latest version.

## CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product communicates with a host that provides a certificate, but the product does not properly ensure that the certificate is actually associated with that host.

### Extended Description


Even if a certificate is well-formed, signed, and follows the chain of trust, it may simply be a valid certificate for a different site than the site that the product is interacting with. If the certificate's host-specific data is not properly checked - such as the Common Name (CN) in the Subject or the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension of an X.509 certificate - it may be possible for a redirection or spoofing attack to allow a malicious host with a valid certificate to provide data, impersonating a trusted host. In order to ensure data integrity, the certificate must be valid and it must pertain to the site that is being accessed.


Even if the product attempts to check the hostname, it is still possible to incorrectly check the hostname. For example, attackers could create a certificate with a name that begins with a trusted name followed by a NUL byte, which could cause some string-based comparisons to only examine the portion that contains the trusted name.


This weakness can occur even when the product uses Certificate Pinning, if the product does not verify the hostname at the time a certificate is pinned.

## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.

### Extended Description


Attackers might be able to spoof the intended endpoint from a different system or process, thus gaining the same level of access as the intended endpoint.


While this issue frequently involves authentication between network-based clients and servers, other types of communication channels and endpoints can have this weakness.

### Additional Notes
**[Research Gap]** This is critical for mobile code, but it is likely to become more and more common as developers continue to adopt automated, network-based product distributions and upgrades. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) might introduce additional subtleties. Common exploitation scenarios may include ad server compromises and bad upgrades.



### Observed Examples

## CWE-599: Missing Validation of OpenSSL Certificate
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses OpenSSL and trusts or uses a certificate without using the SSL_get_verify_result() function to ensure that the certificate satisfies all necessary security requirements.

### Extended Description
This could allow an attacker to use an invalid certificate to claim to be a trusted host, use expired certificates, or conduct other attacks that could be detected if the certificate is properly validated.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-295

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** CWE-295 and CWE-599 are very similar, although CWE-599 has a more narrow scope that is only applied to OpenSSL certificates. As a result, other children of CWE-295 can be regarded as children of CWE-599 as well. CWE's use of one-dimensional hierarchical relationships is not well-suited to handle different kinds of abstraction relationships based on concepts like types of resources ("OpenSSL certificate" as a child of "any certificate") and types of behaviors ("not validating expiration" as a child of "improper validation").






## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

### Extended Description


Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:


  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.

  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.

  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.

  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.

  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.

  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.

There are three main kinds of XSS:

  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.

  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. 

  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. 

Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as "drive-by hacking."

In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.


### Alternative Terms
XSS: A common abbreviation for Cross-Site Scripting.
HTML Injection: Used as a synonym of stored (Type 2) XSS.
CSS: In the early years after initial discovery of XSS, "CSS" was a commonly-used acronym. However, this would cause confusion with "Cascading Style Sheets," so usage of this acronym has declined significantly.

**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

There can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.


**[Applicable Platform]** 

XSS flaws are very common in web applications, since they require a great deal of developer discipline to avoid them.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-25926:** Python Library Manager did not sufficiently neutralize a user-supplied search term, allowing reflected XSS.
- **CVE-2021-25963:** Python-based e-commerce platform did not escape returned content on error pages, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.
- **CVE-2021-1879:** Universal XSS in mobile operating system, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.

- **CVE-2022-29951:** TCP-based protocol in Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) has no authentication.
- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.




## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.
