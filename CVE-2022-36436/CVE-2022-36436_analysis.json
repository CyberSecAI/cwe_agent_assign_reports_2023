CWE-757 is a base level CWE, which is preferred, and focuses on the selection of a less secure algorithm during negotiation, which is exactly what happens in this vulnerability. CWE-287 and CWE-1390 are class-level CWEs and are parents of CWE-757. CWE-305, Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness, can be considered a peer since the core issue is a primary weakness that enables the bypass.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe757[\"CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe305[\"CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\"]\n\n    cwe757 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe757 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe305 -->|PEEROF| cwe757\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe757 primary\n    class cwe287,cwe1390,cwe305 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper implementation** of the VNC authentication proxy, which advertises and accepts \"None\" as a valid security type. This leads to an **authentication bypass**, allowing a remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to the VNC session or disconnect a legitimate user.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **authentication bypass** and the root cause. The evidence clearly points to the server accepting \"None\" as a security type, which effectively downgrades the authentication.\n\nThe selection of CWE-757 is based on the following evidence:\n\n*   **Vulnerability Description:** \"...an vncap/vnc/protocol.py VNCServerAuthenticator **authentication-bypass** vulnerability that could allow a malicious actor to gain unauthorized access...\"\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** \"The vulnerability stems from the VNCAuthProxy not enforcing the 'VNC Authentication' security type during the RFB handshake...The proxy server advertises both 'None' (no authentication) and 'VNC Authentication' as supported security types...The proxy server accepts the client's selection of 'None' as a valid security type and proceeds without requiring authentication.\"\n*   **Retriever Results:** CWE-757 has the highest similarity score.\n\nCWE-757 accurately describes the **weakness** where a less secure algorithm (None) is selected during negotiation. While CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) are relevant, they are more general. CWE-305 (Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness) is also relevant, but CWE-757 captures the specific mechanism of the **bypass** through algorithm downgrade.\n\nTherefore, CWE-757 is the most specific and appropriate choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use

Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication algorithm is sound, but the implemented mechanism can be **bypassed** as the result of a separate

abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**:

Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are

preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm",
