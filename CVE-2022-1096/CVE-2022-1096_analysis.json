The end result is heap corruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the primary weakness as **type confusion** (CWE-843) based on the vulnerability description and the \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also supports this by stating that the \"**Root Cause**\" is a **type confusion** error within the V8 JavaScript engine.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-843 as the primary CWE is justified because it directly reflects the root cause of the vulnerability. The retriever results and similar CVE descriptions also support this selection. CWE-787 and CWE-416 are included as secondary weaknesses due to the potential for memory corruption, but they are not as directly linked to the root cause as CWE-843.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-416: Use After Free\n**Abstraction Level**: variant\n**Similarity Score**: 4.53\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-416: Use After Free\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n*   CWE-120, CWE-122, CWE-125, CWE-129, CWE-131, CWE-170, CWE-190, CWE-191, CWE-195, CWE-356, CWE-404, CWE-415, CWE-451, CWE-667, CWE-681, CWE-823, CWE-825, CWE-1284, CWE-1289, CWE-1341: These CWEs were not selected because the description focuses on the **type confusion** aspect of the vulnerability.
