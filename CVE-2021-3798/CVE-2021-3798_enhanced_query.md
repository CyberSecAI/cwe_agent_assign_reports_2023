# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-3798

## Vulnerability Description
A flaw was found in openCryptoki. The openCryptoki Soft token does not check if an EC key is valid when an EC key is created via C_CreateObject, nor when C_DeriveKey is used with ECDH public data. This may allow a malicious user to extract the private key by performing an invalid curve attack.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper EC key validation**
- **impact:** extract private key
- **vector:** invalid curve attack
- **attacker:** malicious user
- **product:** openCryptoki Soft token

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of Elliptic Curve (EC) keys when constructing them from PKCS#11 attributes or ECDH public data in OpenCryptoki. Specifically, the code was not verifying if the provided EC key data was valid, i.e., if the point was actually on the curve. This meant that an attacker could potentially create an EC key object with invalid key data, or use an invalid public key to derive a secret using ECDH

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insufficient validation:** The primary weakness was the lack of validation of EC keys during creation and derivation. The code did not check if the provided EC public or private key data was valid before creating the key object or using it in key derivation.
*   **Potential use of invalid keys:** This could lead to the creation of EC key objects with invalid key data or the use of invalid public keys for ECDH key derivation.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Creation of invalid keys:** An attacker could create EC key objects using invalid key data. The impact of this would depend on how these keys are subsequently used within the system.
*   **Failed key derivation:** If invalid EC public keys were used during ECDH key derivation, the derivation process would either fail or produce an incorrect secret, which could lead to application failures or security vulnerabilities.
*   **Potential for wider security issues:** Although not explicitly stated, it's possible that by creating invalid keys, an attacker might be able to introduce further vulnerabilities in dependent applications using the keys if they do not handle the situation correctly.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **C\_CreateObject:** An attacker could exploit the vulnerability through the `C_CreateObject` function by providing crafted, invalid EC key data.
*   **C\_DeriveKey:** The `C_DeriveKey` function could be exploited by using a malformed EC public key in ECDH derivation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker would need the ability to call the PKCS#11 functions `C_CreateObject` and `C_DeriveKey` within the OpenCryptoki environment.
*   The attacker must be able to provide the crafted/malicious key material.

**Mitigation:**

The fix implemented in the commit introduces a check using `EC_KEY_check_key` when constructing an OpenSSL EC public or private key. This function verifies the validity of the key, ensuring the point is on the curve, preventing the creation of keys with invalid data and ensuring correct key derivation. The first iteration of the fix included an `EC_POINT_is_on_curve` check, but this was later removed in favor of solely using `EC_KEY_check_key` due to the performance cost of the additional check, as `EC_KEY_check_key` performs this check anyway.

**Additional notes:**
*   The content provides more detail than the typical CVE description by specifying the exact functions affected and the nature of the validation problem, as well as providing the relevant code changes.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by explicitly checking the validity of the EC keys in the `fill_ec_key_from_pubkey` and `fill_ec_key_from_privkey` functions.

## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

### Extended Description
Discrepancies can take many forms, and variations may be detectable in timing, control flow, communications such as replies or requests, or general behavior. These discrepancies can reveal information about the product's operation or internal state to an unauthorized actor. In some cases, discrepancies can be used by attackers to form a side channel.

### Alternative Terms
Side Channel Attack: Observable Discrepancies are at the root of side channel attacks.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-200

- **CVE-2019-10071:** Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies




## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

### Extended Description
In security-relevant contexts, even small variations in timing can be exploited by attackers to indirectly infer certain details about the product's internal operations. For example, in some cryptographic algorithms, attackers can use timing differences to infer certain properties about a private key, making the key easier to guess. Timing discrepancies effectively form a timing side channel.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Often primary in cryptographic applications and algorithms.

**[Maintenance]** CWE 4.16 removed a demonstrative example for a hardware module because it was inaccurate and unable to be adapted. The CWE team is developing an alternative.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-10071:** Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies
- **CVE-2019-10482:** Smartphone OS uses comparison functions that are not in constant time, allowing side channels
- **CVE-2014-0984:** Password-checking function in router terminates validation of a password entry when it encounters the first incorrect character, which allows remote attackers to obtain passwords via a brute-force attack that relies on timing differences in responses to incorrect password guesses, aka a timing side-channel attack.




## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

### Extended Description


By design, authentication protocols try to ensure that attackers must perform brute force attacks if they do not know the credentials such as a key or password. However, when these credentials are easily predictable or even fixed (as with default or hard-coded passwords and keys), then the attacker can defeat the mechanism without relying on brute force.


Credentials may be weak for different reasons, such as:


  - Hard-coded (i.e., static and unchangeable by the administrator)

  - Default (i.e., the same static value across different deployments/installations, but able to be changed by the administrator)

  - Predictable (i.e., generated in a way that produces unique credentials across deployments/installations, but can still be guessed with reasonable efficiency)

Even if a new, unique credential is intended to be generated for each product installation, if the generation is predictable, then that may also simplify guessing attacks.

### Alternative Terms

**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **[REF-1374]:** Chain: JavaScript-based cryptocurrency library can fall back to the insecure Math.random() function instead of reporting a failure (CWE-392), thus reducing the entropy (CWE-332) and leading to generation of non-unique cryptographic keys for Bitcoin wallets (CWE-1391)
- **CVE-2022-30270:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses default credentials for some SSH accounts
- **CVE-2022-29965:** Distributed Control System (DCS) uses a deterministic algorithm to generate utility passwords




## CWE-1394: Use of Default Cryptographic Key
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a default cryptographic key for potentially critical functionality.

### Extended Description
It is common practice for products to be designed to use default keys. The rationale is to simplify the manufacturing process or the system administrator's task of installation and deployment into an enterprise. However, if admins do not change the defaults, it is easier for attackers to bypass authentication quickly across multiple organizations.

### Alternative Terms

- **CVE-2010-2306:** Intrusion Detection System (IDS) uses the same static, private SSL keys for multiple devices and installations, allowing decryption of SSL traffic




## CWE-385: Covert Timing Channel
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Covert timing channels convey information by modulating some aspect of system behavior over time, so that the program receiving the information can observe system behavior and infer protected information.

### Extended Description


In some instances, knowing when data is transmitted between parties can provide a malicious user with privileged information. Also, externally monitoring the timing of operations can potentially reveal sensitive data. For example, a cryptographic operation can expose its internal state if the time it takes to perform the operation varies, based on the state.


Covert channels are frequently classified as either storage or timing channels. Some examples of covert timing channels are the system's paging rate, the time a certain transaction requires to execute, and the time it takes to gain access to a shared bus.


### Alternative Terms

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.9, members of the CWE Hardware SIG are working to improve CWE's coverage of transient execution weaknesses, which include issues related to Spectre, Meltdown, and other attacks that create or exploit covert channels. As a result of that work, this entry might change in CWE 4.10.






## CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not properly restrict reading from or writing to dynamically-managed code resources such as variables, objects, classes, attributes, functions, or executable instructions or statements.

### Extended Description
Many languages offer powerful features that allow the programmer to dynamically create or modify existing code, or resources used by code such as variables and objects. While these features can offer significant flexibility and reduce development time, they can be extremely dangerous if attackers can directly influence these code resources in unexpected ways.
