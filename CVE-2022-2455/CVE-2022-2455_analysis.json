While usually discouraged, it aligns reasonably well with the description of exhausting server resources. A more specific Base-level CWE, CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling), was also considered as a secondary candidate, representing a potential root cause of the uncontrolled resource consumption. CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400, indicating a hierarchical relationship where CWE-770 could be a more specific instance of CWE-400.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **business logic issue** that allows an authenticated user to import a malicious project. This leads to the allocation of server resources without proper limits or throttling (potentially CWE-770), ultimately resulting in the exhaustion of server resources (CWE-400).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the most appropriate CWE based on the vulnerability description. The description clearly states that an authenticated user can exhaust server resources by importing a malicious project, indicating **uncontrolled resource consumption**.\n\nThe evidence for this assessment is primarily based on the vulnerability description: \"allowed an authenticated and authorized user to **exhaust server resources** by importing a malicious project.\" This aligns with the description of CWE-400, which states: \"The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\"\n\nCWE-400 is discouraged because it is a class and is often misused when more precise mappings are available. Considering this, I have also included CWE-770 as a more specific possible weakness since the description also alludes to the allocation of resources without limits or throttling.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-400 as the primary and CWE-770 as a secondary weakness aims to balance the need for specificity with the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of

properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove
