CWE-347 focuses specifically on cryptographic signatures. CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) and CWE-1240 (Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation) are related to the overall cryptographic context, but they are not directly in the chain of causation. CWE-1240 is a ChildOf CWE-327.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe1240[\"CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\"]\n    \n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    cwe1240 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe345,cwe327,cwe1240 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **default algorithms setting in PyJWT**. This leads to **insufficient validation of key types** which causes **improper verification of cryptographic signatures**, allowing an attacker to forge JWT tokens.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **rootcause**, the **default algorithms setting in PyJWT**. The core issue is that the library **fails to properly validate that a key intended for asymmetric encryption is not misused as a secret for HMAC algorithms.**\n\nThe evidence to support this is present in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" under \"root_cause\": \"The PyJWT library incorrectly handles public keys when used with HMAC algorithms. It **fails to properly validate** that a key intended for asymmetric encryption (like EdDSA or ECDSA with formats such as PEM or OpenSSH) is not misused as a secret for HMAC (symmetric) algorithms.\"\n\nThe retriever results suggested considering CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) and CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature). While CWE-327 is relevant, the core issue is not that the algorithm itself is broken, but rather that the signature verification is **improper**. Therefore, CWE-347 is the more accurate primary classification. CWE-1240 also applies since the keys are implemented in a risky way, but the signature verification is the primary weakness.\n\nCWE-347 is chosen as the primary CWE because the vulnerability lies in the **improper verification of the cryptographic signature**. The library **fails to properly validate** that a public key is not being used as a secret key for HMAC algorithms. This allows an attacker to forge JWT tokens.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm or scheme that produces insufficient entropy, leaving patterns or clusters of values that are more likely to occur than others.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
