CWE-319 highlights the risk of transmitting this data in cleartext, while CWE-538 focuses on storing sensitive data in an accessible location. The base level of abstraction is selected for all CWEs to accurately represent the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe538[\"CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\"]\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n    \n    cwe201 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe212\n    cwe201 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe319\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe538\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe319,cwe538 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **inclusion of password parameters from the original build in replayed builds**. This leads to the **insertion of sensitive information into sent data** (CWE-201) during the replay. Depending on how the data is handled, it could result in **cleartext transmission of sensitive information** (CWE-319) or **insertion of sensitive information into an externally-accessible file or directory** (CWE-538).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary focus of this vulnerability is the **inclusion of sensitive password parameters in replayed builds**, allowing unauthorized access to these values. The assessment is based on the vulnerability description which states \"Jenkins Pipeline Groovy Plugin 2648.va9433432b33c and earlier includes **password parameters from the original build in replayed builds**, allowing attackers with Run/Replay permission to obtain the values of password parameters passed to previous builds of a Pipeline.\".\n\nCWE-201 is chosen as the primary CWE because the core issue is that sensitive information is being sent (included) in the replayed build data. CWE-319 and CWE-538 are secondary because they describe potential consequences of this initial **insertion of sensitive data**.\n\nSeveral other CWEs were considered but not selected:\n\n*   CWE-306 (**Missing Authentication for Critical Function**), CWE-862 (**Missing Authorization**), and CWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**) were not selected because the issue is not about missing or incorrect authorization checks, but rather the **inclusion of sensitive information** in the build replay process.\n*   CWE-522 (**Insufficiently Protected Credentials**) was not selected because while it is related to credentials, the specific vulnerability is not about the protection mechanisms but about the presence of the credentials in the replayed build data.\n*   CWE-549 (**Missing Password Field Masking**) was not selected as it is more relevant to password entry rather than the replay of a build with pre-existing parameters.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they address the core issue of **sensitive data inclusion** and potential consequences.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as
