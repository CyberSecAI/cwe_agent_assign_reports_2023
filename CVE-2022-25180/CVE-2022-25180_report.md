## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.75 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.60 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |
| CWE-538 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory | 0.50 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-201, which is related to sending sensitive data, and the secondary CWEs further specify the nature of the sensitive data handling. CWE-319 highlights the risk of transmitting this data in cleartext, while CWE-538 focuses on storing sensitive data in an accessible location. The base level of abstraction is selected for all CWEs to accurately represent the root cause of the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **inclusion of password parameters from the original build in replayed builds**. This leads to the **insertion of sensitive information into sent data** (CWE-201) during the replay. Depending on how the data is handled, it could result in **cleartext transmission of sensitive information** (CWE-319) or **insertion of sensitive information into an externally-accessible file or directory** (CWE-538).

## Summary of Analysis
The primary focus of this vulnerability is the **inclusion of sensitive password parameters in replayed builds**, allowing unauthorized access to these values. The assessment is based on the vulnerability description which states "Jenkins Pipeline Groovy Plugin 2648.va9433432b33c and earlier includes **password parameters from the original build in replayed builds**, allowing attackers with Run/Replay permission to obtain the values of password parameters passed to previous builds of a Pipeline.".

CWE-201 is chosen as the primary CWE because the core issue is that sensitive information is being sent (included) in the replayed build data. CWE-319 and CWE-538 are secondary because they describe potential consequences of this initial **insertion of sensitive data**.

Several other CWEs were considered but not selected:

*   CWE-306 (**Missing Authentication for Critical Function**), CWE-862 (**Missing Authorization**), and CWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**) were not selected because the issue is not about missing or incorrect authorization checks, but rather the **inclusion of sensitive information** in the build replay process.
*   CWE-522 (**Insufficiently Protected Credentials**) was not selected because while it is related to credentials, the specific vulnerability is not about the protection mechanisms but about the presence of the credentials in the replayed build data.
*   CWE-549 (**Missing Password Field Masking**) was not selected as it is more relevant to password entry rather than the replay of a build with pre-existing parameters.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they address the core issue of **sensitive data inclusion** and potential consequences.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism
