This is a child of CWE-94 ('Code Injection'), which is a broader category. CWE-184 (Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs) represents a potential weakness in the attempted mitigation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe184[\"CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\"]\n    \n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe184 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe1336\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1336 primary\n    class cwe94,cwe184 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper** use of the `filter` Twig filter (CWE-1336), which allows the execution of arbitrary PHP functions. This leads to **code injection** (CWE-94) and, ultimately, remote code execution. The attempted mitigation might have an **incomplete list of disallowed inputs** (CWE-184).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed to CWE-1336 as the primary weakness, which aligns with the **Code Injection** vulnerability described in the context of a Twig template engine. The commit message \"Fixed Twig `|filter()` allowing code execution\" and the code diff that shows the addition of a check using `Utils::isDangerousFunction($arrow)` in the new `filterFilter` to prevent the use of potentially dangerous functions, confirms this assessment. CWE-94 is a parent of CWE-1336.\nCWE-184 is included because the fix implemented in the provided commit involves the `filterFilter` function which now checks if the passed `arrow` argument is a dangerous function before calling the `twig_array_filter` function, thus the fix seems to implement a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-1336 accurately capturing the template engine context and CWE-94 representing the broader **code injection** category and CWE-184 for the mitigation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
