*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-862 **Missing Authorization**, which is a Class-level CWE. The child CWEs of CWE-862 such as CWE-285 and CWE-284 were considered but were not specific enough. CWE-927 **Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication** is related because the vulnerability involves a deep link which could be considered an implicit intent. The analysis favors CWE-862 because the core issue is that the system **fails to perform an authorization check** due to the deep link bypassing the normal access controls.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the use of a deep link on large screen devices, which leads to the calling package being overridden. This results in **Missing Authorization** (CWE-862) because the "Connected devices" page cannot correctly identify the origin of the call. As a result, Bluetooth discoverability settings can be bypassed, leading to potential information disclosure.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified a **permissions bypass** in SettingsActivity.java that allows making a device discoverable over Bluetooth without proper authorization. The analysis of the CVE Reference Links content confirms that the root cause involves a loss of calling package information when deep links are used on large screen devices. This leads to **Missing Authorization** (CWE-862) because the system cannot properly verify the origin of the request. The evidence supporting this is:

-   "The vulnerability arises from how deep links are handled on large screen devices...This process overrides the calling package, preventing the target activity from knowing who initially called it."
-   "The 'Connected devices' page relies on knowing the calling package to make bluetooth not discoverable. The deep link flow bypasses this access control."

The selected CWE, CWE-862, is at the Class level of abstraction, which is appropriate given the available information. While more specific Base-level CWEs might exist, the current evidence sufficiently supports the **Missing Authorization** at a broader level. The mapping guidance for CWE-862 suggests reviewing child entries for a better fit, but none of the children provide a more accurate representation of the vulnerability.

The secondary candidate, CWE-927 **Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication**, was considered because the deep link mechanism could be viewed as an implicit intent. However, the primary issue is the **Missing Authorization**, making CWE-862 the more accurate classification.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-20396

## Vulnerability Description
In SettingsActivity.java, there is a possible way to make a device discoverable over Bluetooth, without permission or user interaction, due to a **permissions bypass**. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product AndroidVersions Android-12L Android-13Android ID A-234440688

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **permissions bypass**
- **impact:** make a device discoverable over Bluetooth
- **product:** Android
- **version:** 12L, 13
- **component:** SettingsActivity.java

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20396:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability arises from how deep links are handled on large screen devices. When a deep link is used, a homepage activity is started on the left pane, and the target activity is started on the right pane. This process overrides the calling package, preventing the target activity from knowing who initially called it.
- Specifically, when the "Connected devices" page is launched via a deep link from an unintended app on large screen devices, the bluetooth discoverability setting may not be correctly managed because the calling package information is lost.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Calling Package Identification:** The primary weakness is the loss of the initial calling package information due to the deep link flow.
- **Missing Access Control:** The "Connected devices" page relies on knowing the calling package to make bluetooth not discoverable. The deep link flow bypasses this access control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure (ID):** The impact is classified as "High" and involves information disclosure. Specifically, the Bluetooth discoverability settings may be bypassed, potentially allowing other devices to discover the vulnerable device when it should not be. This is possible because the Bluetooth settings are not being properly controlled when an unintended app launches it via deep link.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Deep Links:** The attack vector is through the use of deep links on large-screen devices.
- **Unintended Apps:** An attacker needs to utilize an unintended app to start the "Connected devices" page activity via a deep link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker would need to craft or utilize an app capable of launching a deep link to the "Connected devices" page on a large screen Android device.
- The attacker must be able to install and run an app on the target device to initiate the deep link.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix involves storing the initial calling package in the intent, so that the "Connected devices" page can determine the origin of the call and enforce Bluetooth discoverability settings appropriately.
- The provided commit message indicates the fix was introduced to prevent unintended apps from bypassing bluetooth discoverability settings.

## CWE-927: Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The Android application uses an implicit intent for transmitting sensitive data to other applications.

### Extended Description


Since an implicit intent does not specify a particular application to receive the data, any application can process the intent by using an Intent Filter for that intent. This can allow untrusted applications to obtain sensitive data. There are two variations on the standard broadcast intent, ordered and sticky.


Ordered broadcast intents are delivered to a series of registered receivers in order of priority as declared by the Receivers. A malicious receiver can give itself a high priority and cause a denial of service by stopping the broadcast from propagating further down the chain. There is also the possibility of malicious data modification, as a receiver may also alter the data within the Intent before passing it on to the next receiver. The downstream components have no way of asserting that the data has not been altered earlier in the chain.


Sticky broadcast intents remain accessible after the initial broadcast. An old sticky intent will be broadcast again to any new receivers that register for it in the future, greatly increasing the chances of information exposure over time. Also, sticky broadcasts cannot be protected by permissions that may apply to other kinds of intents.


In addition, any broadcast intent may include a URI that references data that the receiving component does not normally have the privileges to access. The sender of the intent can include special privileges that grant the receiver read or write access to the specific URI included in the intent. A malicious receiver that intercepts this intent will also gain those privileges and be able to read or write the resource at the specified URI.

**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-4903:** An Android application does not use FLAG_IMMUTABLE when creating a PendingIntent.




## CWE-205: Observable Behavioral Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product's behaviors indicate important differences that may be observed by unauthorized actors in a way that reveals (1) its internal state or decision process, or (2) differences from other products with equivalent functionality.

### Extended Description
Ideally, a product should provide as little information about its internal operations as possible. Otherwise, attackers could use knowledge of these internal operations to simplify or optimize their attack. In some cases, behavioral discrepancies can be used by attackers to form a side channel.

### Alternative Terms

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-0208:** Product modifies TCP/IP stack and ICMP error messages in unusual ways that show the product is in use.
- **CVE-2004-2252:** Behavioral infoleak by responding to SYN-FIN packets.




## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.

### Extended Description


Code frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-400
ChildOf -> CWE-665

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).

**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. "Resource exhaustion" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..
- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.




## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-693

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** "origin validation" could fall under this.

**[Maintenance]** The specific ways in which the origin is not properly identified should be laid out as separate weaknesses. In some sense, this is more like a category.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30260:** Distributed Control System (DCS) does not sign firmware images and only relies on insecure checksums for integrity checks
- **CVE-2022-30267:** Distributed Control System (DCS) does not sign firmware images and only relies on insecure checksums for integrity checks
- **CVE-2022-30272:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) does not use signatures for firmware images and relies on insecure checksums




## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

### Extended Description


Locking is a type of synchronization behavior that ensures that multiple independently-operating processes or threads do not interfere with each other when accessing the same resource. All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.

**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms. Multiple entries are dependent on this research, which includes relationships to concurrency, race conditions, reentrant functions, etc. CWE-662 and its children - including CWE-667, CWE-820, CWE-821, and others - may need to be modified significantly, along with their relationships.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-0935:** Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice
- **CVE-2010-4210:** function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.
