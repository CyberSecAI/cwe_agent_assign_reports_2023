The child CWEs of CWE-862 such as CWE-285 and CWE-284 were considered but were not specific enough. CWE-927 **Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication** is related because the vulnerability involves a deep link which could be considered an implicit intent. The analysis favors CWE-862 because the core issue is that the system **fails to perform an authorization check** due to the deep link bypassing the normal access controls.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe927[\"CWE-927: Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe927 -->|PEEROF| cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe927 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the use of a deep link on large screen devices, which leads to the calling package being overridden. This results in **Missing Authorization** (CWE-862) because the \"Connected devices\" page cannot correctly identify the origin of the call. As a result, Bluetooth discoverability settings can be bypassed, leading to potential information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified a **permissions bypass** in SettingsActivity.java that allows making a device discoverable over Bluetooth without proper authorization. The analysis of the CVE Reference Links content confirms that the root cause involves a loss of calling package information when deep links are used on large screen devices. This leads to **Missing Authorization** (CWE-862) because the system cannot properly verify the origin of the request. The evidence supporting this is:\n\n-   \"The vulnerability arises from how deep links are handled on large screen devices...This process overrides the calling package, preventing the target activity from knowing who initially called it.\"\n-   \"The 'Connected devices' page relies on knowing the calling package to make bluetooth not discoverable. The deep link flow bypasses this access control.\"\n\nThe selected CWE, CWE-862, is at the Class level of abstraction, which is appropriate given the available information. While more specific Base-level CWEs might exist, the current evidence sufficiently supports the **Missing Authorization** at a broader level. The mapping guidance for CWE-862 suggests reviewing child entries for a better fit, but none of the children provide a more accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nThe secondary candidate, CWE-927 **Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication**, was considered because the deep link mechanism could be viewed as an implicit intent. However, the primary issue is the **Missing Authorization**, making CWE-862 the more accurate classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
