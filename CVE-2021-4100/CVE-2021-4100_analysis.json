CWE-416, Use After Free, is a variant-level CWE describing the condition where a product reuses memory after it has been freed. CWE-416 is a child of CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference) and CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiration). The relationship between CWE-787 and CWE-416 is not direct, but a Use After Free can lead to an out-of-bounds write.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource after Expiration\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe416 secondary\n    class cwe825,cwe672,cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **object lifecycle issue**, which then leads to **heap corruption**. This corruption could lead to an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) or a use-after-free condition (CWE-416).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is caused by an **object lifecycle issue** that leads to **heap corruption** in ANGLE, a graphics engine used in Google Chrome. The primary weakness is classified as CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), with CWE-416 (Use After Free) considered as a potential secondary weakness.\n\nThe **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** identifies the root cause as an \"**Object lifecycle issue**\" and the impact as \"**heap corruption**\". The \"**CVE Reference Links Content Summary**\" reinforces this by stating, \"Root cause of vulnerability: Object lifecycle issue\" and \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Object lifecycle issue\", confirming that the **object lifecycle issue** is indeed the root cause.\n\nThe primary CWE match suggested by the automated analysis is CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), which aligns with the **heap corruption** impact mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n\nThe retriever results also suggest several other CWEs such as CWE-416 (Use After Free), CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow), and CWE-843 (Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')).\n\nGiven the evidence, CWE-787 is the most appropriate primary CWE because the **heap corruption** indicates a memory safety issue that allows writing outside the intended buffer. CWE-416 is a possible secondary CWE because an object lifecycle issue could lead to a use-after-free condition, which in turn could contribute to **heap corruption**.\n\nCWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) was considered but not chosen as primary because the description does not explicitly mention a buffer overflow. Similarly, CWE-843 (Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')) was considered but not chosen as primary because there isn't enough information to confirm type confusion.\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 as the primary CWE is at the base level of abstraction, providing sufficient specificity for the vulnerability. The choice of CWE-416 is a suitable secondary CWE as it describes a common mechanism by which memory corruption can occur due to object lifecycle issues.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations for the resulting pointer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-127: Buffer Under-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations prior to the targeted buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root",
