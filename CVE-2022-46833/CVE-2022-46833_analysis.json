While it has a child CWE, CWE-1240, the description more generally fits the **use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm**, and we do not have enough information to determine if a non-standard or disallowed implementation is the root cause. CWE-757 is a potential weakness that could be related, as the **vulnerability description** mentions that the user requested weak cipher suites. The relationship between CWE-327 and CWE-757 is less direct but possible.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe1240[\"CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\"]\n    cwe757[\"CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')\"]\n    \n    cwe1240 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    cwe757 -->|PEEROF| cwe327\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe327 primary\n    class cwe1240,cwe757 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm** (CWE-327). If the user is able to request weak cipher suites, it might be a case of Algorithm Downgrade. This **weakness** leads to the ability for a low-privileged remote attacker to decrypt the encrypted data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-327 as the primary **weakness**, supported by the phrase \"**Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm**\" in the **vulnerability description**. The Retriever Results also listed CWE-327 as the top candidate.\n\nThe relationship analysis considered that CWE-1240 is a child of CWE-327, however, there isn't sufficient information to suggest the cryptographic primitive is non-standard, unproven, or disallowed.\nCWE-757 was also considered as a secondary candidate, due to the fact that the user requested weak cipher suites to be used, indicating a possible algorithm downgrade.\n\nThe final decision is to use CWE-327 as the primary **weakness**, as it directly matches the **vulnerability description** and is at an appropriate level of abstraction. CWE-757 is a secondary candidate. This assessment is based on the provided evidence, particularly the \"**Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm**\" phrase, and the retriever results.
