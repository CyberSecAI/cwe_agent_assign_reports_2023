CWE-787, which is a base-level CWE.\nCWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).\nCWE-843 (Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type) is also a base-level CWE.\nCWE-415 (Double Free) is a variant of CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference) and CWE-1341 (Multiple Releases of Same Resource or Handle).\nThe relationships suggest that an out-of-bounds write could lead to memory corruption, potentially causing type confusion or double frees.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119:

is most accurately represented by CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write).\nThe impact is arbitrary code execution, which is a consequence of the memory corruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **memory corruption** as the primary issue, which maps directly to CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write).\nThe retriever results strongly support this assessment, with CWE-787 having the highest score.\nThe vulnerability description key phrases also point to **memory corruption** as the root cause.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is: \"A **memory corruption** issue was addressed with improved validation.\" and \"An app may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.\"\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"**Root cause:** A memory corruption issue.\" and \"**Vulnerability:** Memory corruption in the GPU Drivers.\"\n\nCWE-787 is the most specific and relevant CWE because it directly addresses the **out-of-bounds write**, which is a common cause of **memory corruption**.\nOther CWEs, such as CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), are more general and less specific.\nCWE-843 (Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')) and CWE-415 (Double Free) are considered as secondary candidates because they may be potential consequences of the **memory corruption**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a
