It is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). CWE-668 is a Class level weakness. It is related to the impact of the **missing authorization**, as the credentials IDs are exposed to an actor that should not have access to them.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe668 -->|RELATED_TO| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284,cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check (**CWE-862**). Due to this **missing check**, an attacker with Overall/Read access can enumerate credentials IDs, effectively leading to the Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere (**CWE-668**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\".\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states \"**missing permission checks**\" as the root cause, which aligns directly with the definition of CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).\n> Missing permission checks in Jenkins SSH Agent Plugin 1.23 and earlier allows attackers with Overall/Read access to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms this:\n> **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The SSH Agent Plugin does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.\n> **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Missing permission check.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-862 is a child of more general authorization-related CWEs, but it is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability. While CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) could be considered, it is discouraged by MITRE in favor of its more specific children like CWE-862.\n\nCWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **lack of authorization checks**, which is the **root cause** identified in the vulnerability description.\n\nCWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) was considered because the impact of the vulnerability is that credential IDs are exposed to unauthorized actors. However, it is a secondary concern because the primary weakness is the **missing authorization check** that leads to this exposure. Furthermore, CWE-668 is discouraged, as lower level CWEs are preferred.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
