## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-862, which is a Class-level weakness indicating that the product lacks authorization checks. It is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). CWE-668 is a Class level weakness. It is related to the impact of the **missing authorization**, as the credentials IDs are exposed to an actor that should not have access to them.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check (**CWE-862**). Due to this **missing check**, an attacker with Overall/Read access can enumerate credentials IDs, effectively leading to the Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere (**CWE-668**).

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" and "CVE Reference Links Content Summary".

The vulnerability description explicitly states "**missing permission checks**" as the root cause, which aligns directly with the definition of CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).
> Missing permission checks in Jenkins SSH Agent Plugin 1.23 and earlier allows attackers with Overall/Read access to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.

The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms this:
> **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The SSH Agent Plugin does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.
> **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Missing permission check.

The graph relationships show that CWE-862 is a child of more general authorization-related CWEs, but it is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability. While CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) could be considered, it is discouraged by MITRE in favor of its more specific children like CWE-862.

CWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **lack of authorization checks**, which is the **root cause** identified in the vulnerability description.

CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) was considered because the impact of the vulnerability is that credential IDs are exposed to unauthorized actors. However, it is a secondary concern because the primary weakness is the **missing authorization check** that leads to this exposure. Furthermore, CWE-668 is discouraged, as lower level CWEs are preferred.

## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description


Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.


When access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.


### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information
- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.
- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.




## CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure
**Abstraction:** Pillar
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product.

### Extended Description
This weakness covers three distinct situations. A "missing" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An "insufficient" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an "ignored" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
None

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.
**Comments:** Consider children or descendants of this entry instead.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Research Gap]** The concept of protection mechanisms is well established, but protection mechanism failures have not been studied comprehensively. It is suspected that protection mechanisms can have significantly different types of weaknesses than the weaknesses that they are intended to prevent.
