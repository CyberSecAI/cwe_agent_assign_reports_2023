CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is also a child of CWE-400 and could be related. The selection of CWE-407 reflects the algorithmic nature of the inefficiency, while CWE-770 is also considered because it is related to how the algorithm consumes resources.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n\n    cwe407 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe407 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n    class cwe400 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **mishandled input during hash-table interaction**, leading to a degradation in performance due to the algorithmic inefficiency. This inefficiency then leads to a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **mishandled input during hash-table interaction** and its impact, which is a denial of service. The selection of CWE-407 is based on the \"Root Cause of Vulnerability\" and \"Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present\" from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary which indicates that, \"The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the string hashing algorithm used by Cyrus IMAP, which can lead to collisions when handling certain inputs\" and that a \"hash table collision\" degrades the lookup performance. The CWE-407 description states that, \"An algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\" This aligns well with the vulnerability description. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" also mentions \"**mishandled input during hash-table interaction**\" as the root cause, further supporting this assessment.\n\nCWE-770 is considered a secondary weakness because it relates to how the algorithmic inefficiency manifests as an allocation issue.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-407 is a Class-level weakness that accurately reflects the algorithmic nature of the problem, and CWE-770 is a Base-level weakness that reflects the allocation of resources without limits. Both CWEs are well-supported by the provided evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
