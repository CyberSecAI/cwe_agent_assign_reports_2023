CWE-824 is a base level CWE which is the preferred abstraction level. CWE-824 can precede CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) and CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), but there is no evidence of this in the description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe824[\"CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe824 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe824 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe125\n    cwe824 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe824 primary\n    class cwe125,cwe787,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Access of Uninitialized Pointer** (CWE-824), which leads to the disclosure of arbitrary memory information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **Access of Uninitialized Pointer** as the root cause, aligning with the vulnerability description. The retriever results also ranked CWE-824 highly. The final decision is based on the direct match between the vulnerability description and the CWE-824 definition. The vulnerability description states the rootcause is \"Access of Uninitialized Pointer\" and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section states, \"The software does not properly validate input, which can lead to unexpected behavior.\" This all supports the selection of CWE-824 as the primary CWE.
