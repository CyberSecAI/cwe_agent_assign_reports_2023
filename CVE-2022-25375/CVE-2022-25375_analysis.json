It is a child of CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), which is too general and discouraged. CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is a consequence of the improper validation and therefore a secondary CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1285[\"CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    \n    cwe1285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe125 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe1285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1285 primary\n    class cwe20,cwe125 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command**, leading to **Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input (CWE-1285)**, which allows for an **Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125)**, resulting in **information disclosure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **lack of validation** as the root cause. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" sections both highlight this **lack of validation** specifically related to the size and offset of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command.\n\nThe retriever results suggested several CWEs, with CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) and CWE-1285 (Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input) being strong candidates. However, the vulnerability description focuses on the offset, making CWE-1285 a more precise fit.\n\nThe final selection is based on the evidence pointing to a **lack of validation** of the offset, which allows attackers to read kernel memory. CWE-1285 is the most specific and appropriate CWE for this vulnerability. CWE-125 is a secondary effect of the **improper validation**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**:
