CWE-200 is a Class level CWE, and is considered as a secondary candidate since the information is being written to a log file. The relationships helped solidify the choice of CWE-532 as the primary.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe538[\"CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe538\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe538 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** The **client factory dumps cluster configurations and service account tokens when connection error occurs**.\n2.  **Weakness:** This leads to **insertion of sensitive information into log files** (CWE-532).\n3.  **Impact:** An attacker can **view sensitive cluster configurations** and potentially manage the registered Kubernetes clusters, leading to **exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized actor** (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the logging of sensitive information. The vulnerability description states that the **client factory dumps cluster configurations and service account tokens when connection error occurs**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions **CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File)**. The retriever results also list CWE-532 with the highest score. Therefore, CWE-532 is the most appropriate CWE.\n\nThe relationship graph shows that CWE-532 is a child of CWE-200, which reflects the general class of information exposure. However, CWE-532 is more specific as it involves the insertion of sensitive information into a log file. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-532 accurately describes the **root cause** while CWE-200 describes the impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not chosen because the root cause is not related to the incorrect implementation of an authentication algorithm.*\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This CWE was not chosen because the root cause is not related to weak authentication.*\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not chosen because the root cause is not related to reliance on untrusted inputs.*\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not chosen because the root cause is not related to the improper removal of sensitive information.*\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
