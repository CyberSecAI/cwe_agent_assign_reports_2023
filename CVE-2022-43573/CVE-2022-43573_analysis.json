CWE-200 is a class-level CWE that is often misused, according to its mapping notes. Because the vulnerability specifically exposes private personal information, CWE-359 is the more appropriate and specific choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe359 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves accessing platform level objects which leads to the exposure of creator/modifier email addresses. The root cause is the **failure to properly prevent access to private personal information**, leading to the **impact** of exposure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-359 as the primary candidate, supported by the vulnerability description that explicitly mentions the exposure of email addresses, which falls under private personal information.\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, particularly the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\". The key phrases indicate an **impact** of \"exposure of the name and email for the creator/modifier of platform level objects.\" The CVE summary confirms that \"accessing specific platform level objects... may expose the email address of the creator or modifier.\"\n\nThe graph relationships, especially the child-of relationship between CWE-359 and CWE-200, influenced the final selection. While CWE-200 is a broader category, CWE-359 provides a more specific classification that aligns directly with the type of information exposed.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-359 directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability: the **failure to prevent access to private personal information**, which is the email address in this case.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n*Not selected*: CWE-668 is too general and discouraged for use.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n*Not selected*: There's no evidence that insufficient privileges are involved in this vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected*: There's no evidence of improper isolation or compartmentalization in this case.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected*: There is no evidence to suggest that the vulnerability is caused by reliance on untrusted inputs.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected*: This CWE does not align with the **root cause**, as it involves insertion into a file or directory, which is not specified in the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
