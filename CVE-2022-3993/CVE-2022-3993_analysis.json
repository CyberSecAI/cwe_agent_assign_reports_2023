The secondary CWE, CWE-778, is also a Base level weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe307[\"CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts\"]\n    cwe778[\"CWE-778: Insufficient Logging\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    cwe223[\"CWE-223: Omission of Security-relevant Information\"]\n    \n    cwe307 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe307 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe778 -->|CHILDOF| cwe223\n    cwe778 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe307 primary\n    class cwe778 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts** (CWE-307). If excessive authentication attempts are not properly logged, this leads to **Insufficient Logging** (CWE-778), which makes it harder to detect and respond to brute-force attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed towards CWE-307 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of \"**Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts**\" in the vulnerability description. The \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section also listed CWE-307 as the primary match. Further analysis of the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" revealed additional weaknesses, particularly related to inconsistent error messages and potential information leakage. While these aspects could potentially relate to other CWEs, the core issue remained the **improper restriction of authentication attempts**. The insufficient logging aspect was considered a secondary weakness, as it exacerbates the impact of the primary weakness by hindering detection and response.\n\nThe final decision is strongly based on the evidence provided, particularly the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The selection of CWE-307 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
