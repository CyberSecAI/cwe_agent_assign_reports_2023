While CWE-328 broadly covers the use of weak hashing algorithms, CWE-916 specifically addresses the scenario where password hashes are generated with insufficient computational effort, making them susceptible to cracking. Since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions that the SHA512crypt hash can be easily cracked, CWE-916 is a more specific and accurate representation of the weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n\n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe328\n    cwe328 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe916 primary\n    class cwe328 secondary\n    class cwe327 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper** implementation of a hashing algorithm for the root account password. The **weakness** is the use of SHA512crypt in a way that makes it easily crackable via brute-force attack, leading to unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description highlights the **weakness** in the implementation of SHA512crypt which can be easily cracked via brute-force attack.\n\nCWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) aligns well with this description, as it specifically addresses scenarios where password hashes are vulnerable to cracking due to insufficient computational effort. The retriever results also list CWE-916 as a relevant candidate.\n\nCWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash) was also considered, but CWE-916 is preferred due to its greater specificity.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is clear: \"implements a SHA512crypt hash for the root account which can be easily cracked via a brute-force attack\". This statement indicates that the hashing algorithm, while potentially strong in theory, is implemented in a way that makes it easily compromised. This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-916, which focuses on password hashes that do not provide sufficient computational effort.\n\nBased on the evidence, relationship analysis, and mapping guidance, CWE-916 is the most appropriate and specific classification for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.83\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
