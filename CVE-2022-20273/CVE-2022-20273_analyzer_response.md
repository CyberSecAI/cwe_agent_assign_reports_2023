# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2022-20273

# Summary
| CWE ID  | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-122, which is a variant of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-788 (Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer). CWE-122 is a more specific case of a buffer overflow occurring in the heap, which aligns directly with the vulnerability description's mention of a "**heap buffer overflow**". CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is considered because the vulnerability description also mentions an "**out of bounds read**", so there is a relationship between the read and write aspect of the buffer overflow.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **heap buffer overflow** (CWE-122), which leads to an **out of bounds read**, resulting in remote information disclosure.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description, which clearly states a "**heap buffer overflow**" leading to an "**out of bounds read**" and resulting in remote information disclosure. The selection of CWE-122 is based on the explicit mention of "heap buffer overflow," making it the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability. The description aligns well with CWE-122's definition as a buffer overflow occurring in the heap. The inclusion of CWE-125 is based on the fact that an out-of-bounds read is present, but it's secondary to the main issue of a heap-based buffer overflow, so the primary issue is the **heap buffer overflow** that allows the out-of-bounds read to occur.

# Relevant CWE Information:

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected because the vulnerability does not specify any information about resources not being cleared before reuse.*

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected because the vulnerability does not provide any information on incorrect buffer size calculation. It just mentions a heap buffer overflow.*

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*This CWE was not selected because the vulnerability does not specify anything about locking problems.*

## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not initialize a critical resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*This CWE was not selected because the vulnerability does not specify a missing initialization of any resource.*

## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected because the vulnerability does not involve integer underflow.*

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*This CWE was not selected because the vulnerability does not describe a resource shutdown or release issue.*

## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*This CWE was not selected because the vulnerability does not describe any race condition.*

## CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses or accesses a resource that has not been initialized.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected because the vulnerability does not describe the use of an uninitialized resource.*

## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
If two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected because the vulnerability does not describe any race condition within a thread.*

## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected because the vulnerability does not involve accessing an uninitialized pointer.*

## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 6982.90
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in
