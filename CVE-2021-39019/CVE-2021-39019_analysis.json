CWE-201 is a base class. CWE-598 being a variant of CWE-201 makes it more specific and a better fit. CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is related to the impact of the vulnerability. CWE-200 is a class-level CWE that is too broad and discouraged for use.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe598[\"CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe598 -->|CHILDOF| cwe201\n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe598 primary\n    class cwe319 secondary\n    class cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the application **incorrectly** using the GET method for sensitive information, leading to the **transmission of sensitive information in cleartext**, and finally resulting in the **exposure of sensitive information** to an attacker.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on the core issue of using the GET method for sensitive data. The retriever results highlighted CWE-598, which directly addresses this problem. The vulnerability description states, \"The application uses the POST method to submit passwords, but can be forced to use the GET method,\" which aligns perfectly with CWE-598's description: \"The web application uses the HTTP GET method to process a request and includes sensitive information in the query string of that request.\"\n\nThe analysis also considered CWE-319 because the GET method can expose the sensitive information in transit. CWE-200 was considered but ultimately deemed too broad, as it represents the impact rather than the root cause. The final decision favored CWE-598 as the primary CWE because it accurately represents the **root cause** of the vulnerability, and is at the variant level of abstraction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions is not set, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
