CWE-328 is a child of CWE-326 and CWE-327, which are related to the use of broken or risky cryptography. This hierarchical relationship underscores the importance of addressing the root cause of using a weak hash algorithm.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n    cwe326[\"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    \n    cwe328 -->|CHILDOF| cwe326\n    cwe328 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe328 primary\n    class cwe326,cwe327 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **collision of hash values** due to the usage of simple separator (\"$\"). This leads to SHA256/SHA512_256 not behaving like a random oracle. The final impact is potential compromise of shared secrets, unauthorized access to sensitive data, or manipulation of transactions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-328 as the most appropriate mapping based on the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a **collision of hash values**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further details that the SHA256 hash function uses a \"$\" separator during concatenation which can lead to hash collisions if input values also contain the \"$\" character.\n\nThis is explicit evidence that the hash function is **weak** due to its susceptibility to collisions, which aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-328: \"The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\"\n\nThe retriever results also support this decision, listing CWE-328 as the top combined result. The mapping guidance for CWE-328 explicitly allows its usage and states that it's at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but ultimately deemed less suitable. CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) was considered because the collision can be exploited, but the vulnerability isn't necessarily password related, and is more general. CWE-759 (Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt) and CWE-760 (Use of a One-Way Hash with a Predictable Salt) are specific to password hashing, making CWE-328 a better fit since the weakness applies to general data hashing.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the **weak hash** function due to the use of simple separator.",
