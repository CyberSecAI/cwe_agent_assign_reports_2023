This is a base-level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. CWE-79 is a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')). The relationship indicates that XSS is a specific type of injection. While other CWEs like CWE-80 (Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)) are children of CWE-79, the description doesn't provide the necessary specifics to choose CWE-80 over CWE-79.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe80[\"CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\"]\n\n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe80 -->|CHILDOF| cwe79\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe80 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper input sanitization**, leading to the **cross-site scripting** vulnerability.\n  - Root Cause: **Improper input sanitization**\n  - Weakness: **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**\n  - Impact: Allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the webpage, potentially leading to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, stealing user credentials, defacing the website, or redirecting users to malicious sites.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis clearly points to CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description states the **rootcause** is **improper input sanitization** leading to **cross-site scripting**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by highlighting that the vulnerability existed due to the direct inclusion of `notice.notice.text` into the HTML without proper sanitization. The fix implemented, which is to apply the `html` filter to the notice text, further validates this assessment.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision by clarifying that CWE-79 is a specific type of injection (child of CWE-74) and that more specific variants exist but are not warranted given the available evidence.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because the provided evidence directly supports the characteristics of CWE-79 without needing to delve into more specific variants.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTwo separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
