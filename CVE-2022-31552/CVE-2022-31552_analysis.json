CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) can precede CWE-22 and CWE-36 in a vulnerability chain, where external input influences the path. The hierarchical relationships support the choice of CWE-36 as more specific than CWE-22.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe36[\"CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    \n    cwe36 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe22\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe36\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe36 primary\n    class cwe22,cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with external control over the file path (CWE-73), leading to improper limitation of pathname to a restricted directory (CWE-22). Specifically, the **absolute path traversal** (CWE-36) occurs due to the **insecure** use of the Flask `send_file` function.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the vulnerability as path traversal due to the **insecure** use of the Flask `send_file` function. The evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary supports this assessment.\n\nThe graph relationships highlight the connection between CWE-73, CWE-22, and CWE-36. CWE-36 is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description specifically mentions **absolute path traversal**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-36 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately describes the vulnerability, which is the use of **absolute path traversal** due to the **insecure** use of the Flask `send_file` function.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced
