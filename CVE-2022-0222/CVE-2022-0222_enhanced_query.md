# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-269 is commonly misused. It can be conflated with "privilege escalation," which is a technical impact that is listed in many low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis.
**Comments:** If an error or mistake allows privilege escalation, then use the CWE ID for that mistake. Avoid using CWE-269 when only phrases such as "privilege escalation" or "gain privileges" are available, as these indicate technical impact of the vulnerability - not the root cause weakness. If the root cause seems to be directly related to privileges, then examine the children of CWE-269 for additional hints, such as Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250) or Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266).
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-1555:** Terminal privileges are not reset when a user logs out.
- **CVE-2001-1514:** Does not properly pass security context to child processes in certain cases, allows privilege escalation.
- **CVE-2001-0128:** Does not properly compute roles.




## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).

### Extended Description
Capture-replay attacks are common and can be difficult to defeat without cryptography. They are a subset of network injection attacks that rely on observing previously-sent valid commands, then changing them slightly if necessary and resending the same commands to the server.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1390
ChildOf -> CWE-287

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-3435:** product authentication succeeds if user-provided MD5 hash matches the hash in its database; this can be subjected to replay attacks.
- **CVE-2007-4961:** Chain: cleartext transmission of the MD5 hash of password (CWE-319) enables attacks against a server that is susceptible to replay (CWE-294).




## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-118
ChildOf -> CWE-20

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist




## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.

### Extended Description


There are many different kinds of mistakes that introduce information exposures. The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker. Some kinds of sensitive information include:


  - private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details

  - system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages

  - business secrets and intellectual property

  - network status and configuration

  - the product's own code or internal state

  - metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers

  - indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider

Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected. These parties include:

  - the product's own users

  - people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users

  - the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates

  - the developer

Information exposures can occur in different ways:

  - the code  **explicitly inserts**  sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been "scrubbed" or "sanitized"

  - a different weakness or mistake  **indirectly inserts**  the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.

  - the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are  **unintentionally made accessible**  to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.

It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an "information exposure," but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read. CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store, transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

### Alternative Terms
Information Disclosure: This term is frequently used in vulnerability advisories to describe a consequence or technical impact, for any vulnerability that has a loss of confidentiality. Often, CWE-200 can be misused to represent the loss of confidentiality, even when the mistake - i.e., the weakness - is not directly related to the mishandling of the information itself, such as an out-of-bounds read that accesses sensitive memory contents; here, the out-of-bounds read is the primary weakness, not the disclosure of the memory. In addition, this phrase is also used frequently in policies and legal documents, but it does not refer to any disclosure of security-relevant information.
Information Leak: This is a frequently used term, however the "leak" term has multiple uses within security. In some cases it deals with the accidental exposure of information from a different weakness, but in other cases (such as "memory leak"), this deals with improper tracking of resources, which can lead to exhaustion. As a result, CWE is actively avoiding usage of the "leak" term.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].
**Comments:** If an error or mistake causes information to be disclosed, then use the CWE ID for that error. Consider starting with improper authorization (CWE-285), insecure permissions (CWE-732), improper authentication (CWE-287), etc. Also consider children such as Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data (CWE-201), Observable Discrepancy (CWE-203), Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory (CWE-538), or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As a result of mapping analysis in the 2020 Top 25 and more recent versions, this weakness is under review, since it is frequently misused in mapping to cover many problems that lead to loss of confidentiality. See Mapping Notes, Extended Description, and Alternate Terms.



### Observed Examples

- **CVE-2021-25476:** Digital Rights Management (DRM) capability for mobile platform leaks pointer information, simplifying ASLR bypass
- **CVE-2001-1483:** Enumeration of valid usernames based on inconsistent responses




## CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
This attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1390
ChildOf -> CWE-287

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from insufficient verification.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30319:** S-bus functionality in a home automation product performs access control using an IP allowlist, which can be bypassed by a forged IP address.
- **CVE-2009-1048:** VOIP product allows authentication bypass using 127.0.0.1 in the Host header.




## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges 
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-755

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** CWE-280 and CWE-274 are too similar. It is likely that CWE-274 will be deprecated in the future.

**[Relationship]** This can be both primary and resultant. When primary, it can expose a variety of weaknesses because a resource might not have the expected state, and subsequent operations might fail. It is often resultant from Unchecked Error Condition (CWE-391).

**[Theoretical]** Within the context of vulnerability theory, privileges and permissions are two sides of the same coin. Privileges are associated with actors, and permissions are associated with resources. To perform access control, at some point the software makes a decision about whether the actor (and the privileges that have been assigned to that actor) is allowed to access the resource (based on the permissions that have been specified for that resource).

**[Research Gap]** This type of issue is under-studied, since researchers often concentrate on whether an object has too many permissions, instead of not enough. These weaknesses are likely to appear in environments with fine-grained models for permissions and privileges, which can include operating systems and other large-scale software packages. However, even highly simplistic permission/privilege models are likely to contain these issues if the developer has not considered the possibility of access failure.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2003-0501:** Special file system allows attackers to prevent ownership/permission change of certain entries by opening the entries before calling a setuid program.
- **CVE-2004-0148:** FTP server places a user in the root directory when the user's permissions prevent access to the their own home directory.




## CWE-1257: Improper Access Control Applied to Mirrored or Aliased Memory Regions
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Aliased or mirrored memory regions in hardware designs may have inconsistent read/write permissions enforced by the hardware. A possible result is that an untrusted agent is blocked from accessing a memory region but is not blocked from accessing the corresponding aliased memory region.
			

### Extended Description


Hardware product designs often need to implement memory protection features that enable privileged software to define isolated memory regions and access control (read/write) policies. Isolated memory regions can be defined on different memory spaces in a design (e.g. system physical address, virtual address, memory mapped IO).


Each memory cell should be mapped and assigned a system address that the core software can use to read/write to that memory. It is possible to map the same memory cell to multiple system addresses such that read/write to any of the aliased system addresses would be decoded to the same memory cell.


This is commonly done in hardware designs for redundancy and simplifying address decoding logic. If one of the memory regions is corrupted or faulty, then that hardware can switch to using the data in the mirrored memory region. Memory aliases can also be created in the system address map if the address decoder unit ignores higher order address bits when mapping a smaller address region into the full system address.


A common security weakness that can exist in such memory mapping is that aliased memory regions could have different read/write access protections enforced by the hardware such that an untrusted agent is blocked from accessing a memory address but is not blocked from accessing the corresponding aliased memory address. Such inconsistency can then be used to bypass the access protection of the primary memory block and read or modify the protected memory.


An untrusted agent could also possibly create memory aliases in the system address map for malicious purposes if it is able to change the mapping of an address region or modify memory region sizes.

## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

### Extended Description


This could allow an attacker to access or modify system files or other files that are critical to the application.


Path manipulation errors occur when the following two conditions are met:

```
		1. An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.
		2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.
```
For example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker.

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** CWE-114 is a Class, but it is listed a child of CWE-73 in view 1000. This suggests some abstraction problems that should be resolved in future versions.

**[Relationship]** 

The external control of filenames can be the primary link in chains with other file-related weaknesses, as seen in the CanPrecede relationships. This is because software systems use files for many different purposes: to execute programs, load code libraries, to store application data, to store configuration settings, record temporary data, act as signals or semaphores to other processes, etc.


However, those weaknesses do not always require external control. For example, link-following weaknesses (CWE-59) often involve pathnames that are not controllable by the attacker at all.


The external control can be resultant from other issues. For example, in PHP applications, the register_globals setting can allow an attacker to modify variables that the programmer thought were immutable, enabling file inclusion (CWE-98) and path traversal (CWE-22). Operating with excessive privileges (CWE-250) might allow an attacker to specify an input filename that is not directly readable by the attacker, but is accessible to the privileged program. A buffer overflow (CWE-119) might give an attacker control over nearby memory locations that are related to pathnames, but were not directly modifiable by the attacker.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)
- **CVE-2008-5748:** Chain: external control of values for user's desired language and theme enables path traversal.
- **CVE-2008-5764:** Chain: external control of user's target language enables remote file inclusion.




## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product receives input or data, but it does
        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the
        properties that are required to process the data safely and
        correctly.

### Extended Description


Input validation is a frequently-used technique for checking potentially dangerous inputs in order to ensure that the inputs are safe for processing within the code, or when communicating with other components. When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.


Input validation is not the only technique for processing input, however. Other techniques attempt to transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well (see CWE-138 for more examples.)


Input validation can be applied to:


  - raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.

  - metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size

Data can be simple or structured. Structured data can be composed of many nested layers, composed of combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or structured data.

Many properties of raw data or metadata may need to be validated upon entry into the code, such as:


  - specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.

  - implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size

  - indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures

  - symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.

  - well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax 

  - lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token

  - specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)

  - consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.

  - conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic 

  - equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same

  - authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data

Implied or derived properties of data must often be calculated or inferred by the code itself. Errors in deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor to improper input validation. 

Note that "input validation" has very different meanings to different people, or within different classification schemes. Caution must be used when referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it. For example, some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control to an attacker over an input when they should not be able to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred to as input validation.


Finally, it is important to emphasize that the distinctions between input validation and output escaping are often blurred, and developers must be careful to understand the difference, including how input validation is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a query. The name "O'Reilly" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, this valid name cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the "'" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis. It is also a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Consider lower-level children such as Improper Use of Validation Framework (CWE-1173) or improper validation involving specific types or properties of input such as Specified Quantity (CWE-1284); Specified Index, Position, or Offset (CWE-1285); Syntactic Correctness (CWE-1286); Specified Type (CWE-1287); Consistency within Input (CWE-1288); or Unsafe Equivalence (CWE-1289).
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse

- CWE-1284: Specified Quantity
- CWE-1285: Specified Index, Position, or Offset
- CWE-1286: Syntactic Correctness
- CWE-1287: Specified Type
- CWE-1288: Consistency within Input
- CWE-1289: Unsafe Equivalence
- CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

CWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.


**[Maintenance]** As of 2020, this entry is used more often than preferred, and it is a source of frequent confusion. It is being actively modified for CWE 4.1 and subsequent versions.

**[Maintenance]** Concepts such as validation, data transformation, and neutralization are being refined, so relationships between CWE-20 and other entries such as CWE-707 may change in future versions, along with an update to the Vulnerability Theory document.

**[Maintenance]** Input validation - whether missing or incorrect - is such an essential and widespread part of secure development that it is implicit in many different weaknesses. Traditionally, problems such as buffer overflows and XSS have been classified as input validation problems by many security professionals. However, input validation is not necessarily the only protection mechanism available for avoiding such problems, and in some cases it is not even sufficient. The CWE team has begun capturing these subtleties in chains within the Research Concepts view (CWE-1000), but more work is needed.

**[Terminology]** 

The "input validation" term is extremely common, but it is used in many different ways. In some cases its usage can obscure the real underlying weakness or otherwise hide chaining and composite relationships.


Some people use "input validation" as a general term that covers many different neutralization techniques for ensuring that input is appropriate, such as filtering, canonicalization, and escaping. Others use the term in a more narrow context to simply mean "checking if an input conforms to expectations without changing it." CWE uses this more narrow interpretation.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)
- **CVE-2021-30860:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) leads to integer overflow (CWE-190) in mobile OS, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.

### Extended Description


Limited resources include memory, file system storage, database connection pool entries, and CPU. If an attacker can trigger the allocation of these limited resources, but the number or size of the resources is not controlled, then the attacker could cause a denial of service that consumes all available resources. This would prevent valid users from accessing the product, and it could potentially have an impact on the surrounding environment. For example, a memory exhaustion attack against an application could slow down the application as well as its host operating system.


There are at least three distinct scenarios which can commonly lead to resource exhaustion:


  - Lack of throttling for the number of allocated resources

  - Losing all references to a resource before reaching the shutdown stage

  - Not closing/returning a resource after processing

Resource exhaustion problems are often result due to an incorrect implementation of the following situations:

  - Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.

  - Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.



### Alternative Terms
Resource Exhaustion

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-664

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the "technical impact" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is causing resource consumption, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake. Consider children/descendants such as CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling, CWE-771: Missing Reference to Active Allocated Resource, CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool, CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime, CWE-834: Excessive Iteration, CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification), and others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** "Resource consumption" could be interpreted as a consequence instead of an insecure behavior, so this entry is being considered for modification. It appears to be referenced too frequently when more precise mappings are available. Some of its children, such as CWE-771, might be better considered as a chain.

**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. "Resource exhaustion" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.

**[Other]** 

Database queries that take a long time to process are good DoS targets. An attacker would have to write a few lines of Perl code to generate enough traffic to exceed the site's ability to keep up. This would effectively prevent authorized users from using the site at all. Resources can be exploited simply by ensuring that the target machine must do much more work and consume more resources in order to service a request than the attacker must do to initiate a request.


A prime example of this can be found in old switches that were vulnerable to "macof" attacks (so named for a tool developed by Dugsong). These attacks flooded a switch with random IP and MAC address combinations, therefore exhausting the switch's cache, which held the information of which port corresponded to which MAC addresses. Once this cache was exhausted, the switch would fail in an insecure way and would begin to act simply as a hub, broadcasting all traffic on all ports and allowing for basic sniffing attacks.


**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2020-7218:** Go-based workload orchestrator does not limit resource usage with unauthenticated connections, allowing a DoS by flooding the service
- **CVE-2020-3566:** Resource exhaustion in distributed OS because of "insufficient" IGMP queue management, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
