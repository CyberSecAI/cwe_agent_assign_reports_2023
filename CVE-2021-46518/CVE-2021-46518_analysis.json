CWE-119 is a class-level CWE that is a parent of CWE-787. CWE-126 is a variant of CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read). The relationship between these CWEs is hierarchical, reflecting different levels of abstraction. Choosing CWE-122 as the primary is due to the explicit mention of \"heap buffer overflow\" in the vulnerability description, indicating a memory corruption issue specifically on the heap.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe125\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe122 primary\n    class cwe126,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the crafted JavaScript code (`poc.js`) being processed by the `mjs` engine, leading to a **heap buffer overflow** (CWE-122) due to **improper memory management** in the `mjs_disown` function. The **overflow** can result in memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution, ultimately leading to an application crash or denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified a **heap buffer overflow** in Cesanta MJS v2.20.0, specifically within the `mjs_disown` function. The provided evidence strongly supports classifying this vulnerability as CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow). The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms the **root cause** as a **heap-buffer-overflow** during a read operation in the `mjs_disown` function.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by providing context on how CWE-122 relates to other buffer overflow and memory management CWEs. This helped confirm that CWE-122 is the most specific and appropriate classification, being a variant of the more general CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and ultimately a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).\n\nThe decision to use CWE-122 is based on the explicit mention of a \"**heap buffer overflow**\" in the vulnerability description and the confirmation of this in the reference links content summary: \"The root cause is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `mjs_disown` function.\" This specific detail makes CWE-122 the most accurate choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-680: Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation to determine how much memory to allocate, but an integer overflow can occur that causes less memory to be allocated than expected, leading to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a named chain, which combines multiple weaknesses.\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
