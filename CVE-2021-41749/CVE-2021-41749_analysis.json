It is a `ChildOf` CWE-94, which handles improper code generation. The relationship shows that code injection can occur through template engines. CWE-79, while related due to potential XSS-style attacks, is a peer of CWE-1336. The abstraction levels helped prioritize CWE-1336, a more specific base-level CWE, over the class-level CWE-138.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe138[\"CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\"]\n    \n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe138 -->|CHILDOF| cwe707\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1336 primary\n    class cwe94,cwe79,cwe138 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe chain starts with **improper neutralization** in the template engine (CWE-1336) leading to potential code injection (CWE-94) and potentially manifested as Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79). The root cause is the lack of proper input validation or output encoding in the template engine.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment focused on the **server-side template injection** described in the vulnerability. The Retriever Results strongly suggested CWE-1336, which aligns perfectly with the **weakness**. The description of CWE-1336 precisely matches the vulnerability, stating that \"The product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.\" This is direct evidence from the vulnerability description. The impact, remote code execution, is a common consequence of template injection, further supporting this choice.\n\nCWE-94 was considered because template injection can lead to code injection. However, CWE-1336 is more specific to the template engine context. CWE-79 was considered because template injection can sometimes manifest as XSS.\n\nThe final selection emphasizes CWE-1336 as the primary **weakness** because it directly addresses the root cause, which is the **improper neutralization** within the template engine. This is at the optimal level of specificity, as it is a base-level CWE that accurately represents the vulnerability. The confidence is high (0.8) because the evidence directly supports this mapping.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-776: Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses XML documents and allows their structure to be defined with a Document Type Definition (DTD), but it does not properly control the number of recursive definitions of entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an externally controlled name or reference that resolves to a resource that is outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
