It is a child of CWE-672 (Operation on Resource After Expiration or Release). While other CWEs like CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) are related through chain relationships (CWE-613 CanPrecede CWE-287), CWE-613 directly addresses the **insufficient session expiration**, making it the most specific and appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe613[\"CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource After Expiration or Release\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe613 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe613 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe613 primary\n    class cwe672,cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient session expiration** (CWE-613), which allows threat actors to maintain access to sensitive information for an extended period. This can lead to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data, ultimately impacting data confidentiality and integrity.\n\nCWE-613 (Root Cause) -> Unauthorized Access/Modification/Deletion (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, focusing on the root cause: **insufficient session expiration**. The provided text explicitly states this weakness and its potential impact. The retriever results also list CWE-613 as the top candidate, further supporting this classification.\n\nThe selection of CWE-613 is based on the explicit description of the vulnerability as an **insufficient session expiration** issue. This aligns directly with the CWE's definition and characteristics. The vulnerability allows attackers to access, modify, or delete sensitive information due to sessions not being properly terminated. The graph relationships reinforce the connection between session expiration and potential authentication issues. The choice of CWE-613 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the described weakness.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials): While this CWE was considered due to its appearance in the retriever results, there is no mention of hard-coded credentials in the vulnerability description. Therefore, it is not a suitable match.\n*   CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password): Similar to CWE-798, this CWE is not supported by the provided evidence.\n*   CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information): There is no mention of cleartext transmission.\n*   CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization): This is a broader class of errors, and the evidence points more directly to session management.\n*   CWE-384 (Session Fixation): This CWE is a compound weakness and requires multiple conditions to be met. The vulnerability description focuses solely on **insufficient session expiration**, not the broader session fixation attack.\n*   CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function): This CWE doesn't fit because the application requires authentication, but sessions don't properly expire.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.530\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nAccording to WASC, \"Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- REQUIREDBY -> CWE-352\n- CANPRECEDE -> CWE-287\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-672\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-672\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-613\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.372\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.002\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
