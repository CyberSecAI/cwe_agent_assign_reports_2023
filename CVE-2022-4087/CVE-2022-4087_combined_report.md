# Analysis for CVE-2022-4087

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-208 Observable Timing Discrepancy, is a child of CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy. Selecting the more specific CWE-208 is appropriate because the vulnerability description clearly indicates that the **information exposure** occurs through timing differences related to how the TLS implementation handles invalid padding. This timing side channel allows an attacker to potentially infer information about the plaintext. The higher-level CWE-203 is still relevant as it captures the general concept of observable discrepancies, but CWE-208 provides a more precise classification.

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **manipulation of the pad_len argument** within the `tls_new_ciphertext` function. This leads to a padding oracle vulnerability, where the original code's behavior of immediately returning an error for invalid padding creates a timing side channel. The ultimate impact is **information exposure**, as an attacker can exploit the timing discrepancy to decrypt ciphertext or inject malicious payloads.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and impact of the vulnerability. The key evidence lies in the vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary, which clearly describe the padding oracle vulnerability and the timing-based information exposure.

The vulnerability description mentions the **manipulation of the pad_len argument** leading to **information exposure through discrepancy**. The CVE reference links content summary elaborates on this, stating that the original code was susceptible to padding oracle attacks because it immediately returned an error if the padding length was invalid, allowing an attacker to determine if a block of ciphertext has valid or invalid padding by observing the timing. This creates a timing side channel.

Based on this evidence, CWE-208 Observable Timing Discrepancy is the most appropriate primary CWE. It accurately captures the essence of the vulnerability, where timing variations reveal security-relevant information. CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy is included as a secondary CWE to represent the broader category of observable differences.

The Retriever Results and Complete CWE Specifications further support this selection. CWE-208 is listed as a potential match, and its description aligns well with the vulnerability details. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-208 recommends its use when timing differences expose internal operations, which is precisely what occurs in this vulnerability.

Other CWEs were considered but ultimately deemed less suitable. CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'), CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'), and CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read, are not relevant because the vulnerability does not involve input validation issues, SQL commands, or out-of-bounds memory access. CWE-1241 Use of Predictable Algorithm in Random Number Generator and CWE-341 Predictable from Observable State are also less relevant, as the vulnerability does not involve predictable random number generation or predictability based on system state.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-208 is a Base-level CWE that directly addresses the timing side channel, while CWE-203 is a higher-level CWE that provides a broader context.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-4087

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in iPXE. It has been declared as problematic. This vulnerability affects the function tls_new_ciphertext of the file src/net/tls.c of the component TLS. The manipulation of the argument pad_len leads to information exposure through discrepancy. The name of the patch is 186306d6199096b7a7c4b4574d4be8cdb8426729. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-214054 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **manipulation of pad_len argument**
- **impact:** information exposure
- **product:** iPXE
- **component:** TLS

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to a commit that addresses a potential vulnerability, specifically a padding oracle attack in the `tls.c` file of the ipxe project.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability arises from how the TLS implementation handles invalid block padding in the ciphertext. Previously, an invalid padding length would immediately lead to an error. This could potentially be exploited in padding oracle attacks where an attacker infers information about the plaintext by observing if the padding is valid or not.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Padding Oracle Vulnerability:** The original code is susceptible to padding oracle attacks because it immediately returns an error if the padding length is invalid, allowing an attacker to determine if a block of ciphertext has valid or invalid padding.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker could potentially decrypt ciphertext, extract sensitive information or inject malicious payloads.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is a TLS connection where a block cipher is used. The attacker would need to manipulate the ciphertext to observe the server's response regarding the validity of padding.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or manipulate TLS traffic. They need the ability to send modified ciphertext blocks to the vulnerable server and observe whether the server returns an error indicating invalid padding.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability is addressed by changing how invalid padding is handled. Instead of immediately returning an error for invalid padding, the code will now assume the padding length is zero. This will ensure that the MAC (Message Authentication Code) is always computed even if padding is invalid, thus preventing the attacker from getting information about the padding by observing error messages. The error will still occur, but only after MAC calculation, making it less useful for attackers.

**Additional details:**
- The code change is in the `tls_new_ciphertext` function in `src/net/tls.c`.
- The commit message "Treat invalid block padding as zero length padding" clearly describes the fix.
- The commit aims to harden against padding oracle attacks by deferring the failure until after the (incorrect) MAC is computed.

## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

### Extended Description


Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:


  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.

  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.

  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.

  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.

  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.

  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.

There are three main kinds of XSS:

  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.

  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. 

  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. 

Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as "drive-by hacking."

In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.


### Alternative Terms
XSS: A common abbreviation for Cross-Site Scripting.
HTML Injection: Used as a synonym of stored (Type 2) XSS.
CSS: In the early years after initial discovery of XSS, "CSS" was a commonly-used acronym. However, this would cause confusion with "Cascading Style Sheets," so usage of this acronym has declined significantly.

**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

There can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.


**[Applicable Platform]** 

XSS flaws are very common in web applications, since they require a great deal of developer discipline to avoid them.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-25926:** Python Library Manager did not sufficiently neutralize a user-supplied search term, allowing reflected XSS.
- **CVE-2021-25963:** Python-based e-commerce platform did not escape returned content on error pages, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.
- **CVE-2021-1879:** Universal XSS in mobile operating system, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-1241: Use of Predictable Algorithm in Random Number Generator
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The device uses an algorithm that is predictable and generates a pseudo-random number.

### Extended Description


Pseudo-random number generator algorithms are predictable because their registers have a finite number of possible states, which eventually lead to repeating patterns. As a result, pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) can compromise their randomness or expose their internal state to various attacks, such as reverse engineering or tampering. It is highly recommended to use hardware-based true random number generators (TRNGs) to ensure the security of encryption schemes. TRNGs generate unpredictable, unbiased, and independent random numbers because they employ physical phenomena, e.g., electrical noise, as sources to generate random numbers.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, "randomness" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-3692:** PHP framework uses mt_rand() function (Marsenne Twister) when generating tokens




## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

### Extended Description
In security-relevant contexts, even small variations in timing can be exploited by attackers to indirectly infer certain details about the product's internal operations. For example, in some cryptographic algorithms, attackers can use timing differences to infer certain properties about a private key, making the key easier to guess. Timing discrepancies effectively form a timing side channel.

- **CVE-2014-0984:** Password-checking function in router terminates validation of a password entry when it encounters the first incorrect character, which allows remote attackers to obtain passwords via a brute-force attack that relies on timing differences in responses to incorrect password guesses, aka a timing side-channel attack.




## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.

## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).

### Extended Description

## CWE-385: Covert Timing Channel
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Covert timing channels convey information by modulating some aspect of system behavior over time, so that the program receiving the information can observe system behavior and infer protected information.

### Extended Description


In some instances, knowing when data is transmitted between parties can provide a malicious user with privileged information. Also, externally monitoring the timing of operations can potentially reveal sensitive data. For example, a cryptographic operation can expose its internal state if the time it takes to perform the operation varies, based on the state.


Covert channels are frequently classified as either storage or timing channels. Some examples of covert timing channels are the system's paging rate, the time a certain transaction requires to execute, and the time it takes to gain access to a shared bus.

- **CVE-2002-0389:** Mail server stores private mail messages with predictable filenames in a world-executable directory, which allows local users to read private mailing list archives.
- **CVE-2001-1141:** PRNG allows attackers to use the output of small PRNG requests to determine the internal state information, which could be used by attackers to predict future pseudo-random numbers.
- **CVE-2000-0335:** DNS resolver library uses predictable IDs, which allows a local attacker to spoof DNS query results.




## CWE-704: Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-664

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2022-3979:** Chain: data visualization program written in PHP uses the "!=" operator instead of the type-strict "!==" operator (CWE-480) when validating hash values, potentially leading to an incorrect type conversion (CWE-704)
