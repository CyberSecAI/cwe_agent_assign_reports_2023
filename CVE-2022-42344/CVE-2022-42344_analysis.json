This indicates a hierarchical relationship where CWE-863 is a more specific type of improper authorization. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a child of CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere). The abstraction levels influenced the selection, preferring the class level CWE-863 and CWE-200 because the available information doesn't allow for a more specific Base or Variant CWE selection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284,cwe200,cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863), which leads to information exposure and privilege escalation (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **incorrect authorization** as the primary **root cause**. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**incorrect authorization**\", and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms \"**Improper Input Validation**\" leads to privilege escalation. The retriever results also list CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) as a potential match.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is selected as the primary CWE because it directly reflects the **root cause** described in the vulnerability. It is a class-level CWE, providing a balance between specificity and generality. The MITRE mapping guidance suggests that this CWE is \"Allowed-with-Review\" and that more specific children should be examined. However, the provided information does not give enough context to select a more specific CWE.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is considered a secondary CWE because the **incorrect authorization** leads to information exposure. The vulnerability description mentions \"information exposure,\" indicating that unauthorized actors can access sensitive information.\n\nThe selection of these CWEs is based on the provided evidence, particularly the explicit mention of \"**incorrect authorization**\" and \"information exposure.\" The graph relationships confirm that CWE-863 is a specific type of improper authorization, and the MITRE mapping guidance is followed by selecting the most specific CWE that the evidence supports.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive -
