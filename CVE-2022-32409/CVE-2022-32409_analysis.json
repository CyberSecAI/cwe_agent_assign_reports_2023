This is related to file inclusion vulnerabilities in PHP applications, where the filename used in an include/require statement is improperly controlled. CWE-98 is a child of CWE-706 (Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Critical Data) and CWE-829 (Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere). It can precede CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code). CWE-22 is a base CWE and a parent of CWE-23 and CWE-24, more specific path traversal vulnerabilities.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe98[\"CWE-98: Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion')\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe706[\"CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Critical Data\"]\n    cwe829[\"CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe23[\"CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe24[\"CWE-24: Path Traversal: '../filedir'\"]\n\n    cwe98 -->|CHILDOF| cwe706\n    cwe98 -->|CHILDOF| cwe829\n    cwe98 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe94\n    cwe22 -->|PARENTOF| cwe23\n    cwe22 -->|PARENTOF| cwe24\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe98 primary\n    class cwe22 secondary\n    class cwe706,cwe829,cwe94,cwe23,cwe24 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insecure file inclusion** due to the **lack of input validation**. This leads to the ability to **execute arbitrary PHP code**. The attack vector is a **crafted HTTP request**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-98 as the primary candidate due to the vulnerability description explicitly mentioning a local file inclusion vulnerability in a PHP component. The key phrase \"**insecure file inclusion**\" strongly supports this classification. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further validates this by detailing how **lack of input validation** in constructing file paths allows attackers to inject malicious characters, leading to code execution.\n\nCWE-22 was considered as a secondary weakness, as it describes path traversal vulnerabilities, which often accompany file inclusion issues. The content summary also describes how attackers can use directory traversal sequences.\n\nThe selection of CWE-98 is at the Variant level, which is the most specific and appropriate level for this vulnerability. The supporting evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary provides high confidence in this assessment.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
