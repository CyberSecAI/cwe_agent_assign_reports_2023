This is related to the broader class CWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, which in turn falls under the even broader Pillar CWE-284, Improper Access Control.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe639 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **user-controlled key** (`params[:article][:id]`). This leads to an **authorization bypass**, allowing unauthorized modification of articles.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the supporting evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The key evidence is that the `update` function incorrectly uses `params[:article][:id]` instead of `params[:id]`, allowing a malicious user to modify articles they do not own.\n\nThe selection of CWE-639 is based on the fact that the vulnerability involves a **user-controlled key** that leads to an **authorization bypass**. The description of CWE-639 directly matches this scenario: \"The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\"\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was considered as a broader class that encompasses the specific issue. However, CWE-639 is more specific and accurately reflects the nature of the vulnerability, therefore it was chosen as the primary CWE. CWE-284 is even higher level, and while technically applicable, it is too broad to be useful.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-639 precisely describes the root cause, while CWE-863 provides a broader context of incorrect authorization.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
