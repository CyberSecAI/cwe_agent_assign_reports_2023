# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2021-44362

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1287 | Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.6 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-1287, is a child of CWE-20. This relationship indicates that CWE-1287 is a more specific type of input validation issue. Since the vulnerability involves specifically the type of the input not being validated, CWE-1287 is more appropriate.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events is as follows:
1.  **Root Cause:** The application **does not validate the type** of the `param` JSON element (CWE-1287).
2.  When a non-object (e.g., a string) is provided as the `param`, the program attempts to access it using the subscription operator
3.  This leads to an assertion failure.
4.  The device subsequently reboots.
5.  **Impact:** Denial of service.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on the **improper input validation** due to the application's failure to validate the type of the `param` JSON element. The `cgiserver.cgi` program incorrectly assumes that the `param` JSON element within a command will always be an object. When a non-object (e.g., a string) is provided as the `param`, the program attempts to access it using the subscription operator, leading to an assertion failure and a subsequent device reboot.

The evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary is: "The `cgiserver.cgi` program incorrectly assumes that the `param` JSON element within a command will always be an object. When a non-object (e.g., a string) is provided as the `param`, the program attempts to access it using the subscription operator, leading to an assertion failure and a subsequent device reboot."

The graph relationships confirm that CWE-1287 is a more specific instance of CWE-20, making it a better fit.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-1287 being a Base level CWE that directly addresses the **lack of type validation**.

CWE-20 was considered initially, as it is a general class of **improper input validation**, but CWE-1287 provides a more precise description of the vulnerability. Other CWEs like CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input) were considered but deemed irrelevant as the vulnerability is not related to buffer overflows or out-of-bounds writes but rather to the **incorrect handling of input types**.
