CWE-770 **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling** is a child of CWE-400 **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**. CWE-789 **Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value** is a variant of CWE-770. CWE-1284 **Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input** can precede CWE-789. The abstraction levels guided the selection of the most specific CWE possible.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe789\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe789,cwe1284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper validation of the HTTP request body size** (CWE-1284), which allows an attacker to send a **very large body** that leads to **unlimited allocation of resources** (CWE-770), specifically **memory allocation with an excessive size value** (CWE-789). This ultimately results in **resource exhaustion** and a **denial of service** (DoS).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **lack of proper input validation** of the HTTP request body size, which allows an attacker to send a very large body that can exhaust the node's memory. The retriever results suggested CWE-770 **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**, CWE-789 **Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value**, CWE-400 **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**, and CWE-1284 **Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input** as potential candidates.\n\nThe evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary supports this assessment: \"The ServiceBus server on the edge side **does not properly limit the size of the HTTP request body, leading to potential memory exhaustion**.\" This directly indicates CWE-770, as the server allocates resources (memory) without limits or throttling.\n\nCWE-789 is a more specific variant of CWE-770, focusing on memory allocation. Given the vulnerability description explicitly mentions memory exhaustion, CWE-789 is a relevant secondary CWE.\n\nCWE-1284 addresses the **improper validation of the size** of the HTTP request body, which is a prerequisite for the unlimited allocation of resources.\n\nCWE-400 is a broader class that encompasses uncontrolled resource consumption, but CWE-770 provides a more precise description of the weakness, as it focuses on the allocation aspect. Therefore, CWE-400 is considered a secondary CWE.\n\nThe final selection prioritizes CWE-770 as the primary CWE due to its direct relevance to the root cause, while CWE-789 and CWE-1284 are included as secondary CWEs to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-99: Improper Control of Resource Identifiers ('Resource Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not restrict or incorrectly restricts the input before it is used as an identifier for a resource that may be outside the intended sphere of control.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component that specifies multiple attributes, properties, or fields that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control which attributes can be modified.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**:
