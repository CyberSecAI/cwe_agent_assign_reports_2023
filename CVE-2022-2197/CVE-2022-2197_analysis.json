This leads to **improper authentication**, allowing an attacker to circumvent the authentication scheme and perform administrative operations.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points to CWE-1392 **[CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials]** as the primary weakness, given the **root cause** of the vulnerability is the **use of a specific credential string**. The evidence provided from the vulnerability description key phrases and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary supports this decision. The relationship analysis further solidifies this choice, as CWE-1392 **[CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials]** is a more specific child of the broader CWE-287 **[CWE-287: Improper Authentication]**. The decision to select CWE-1392 **[CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials]** is based on the evidence that an attacker can circumvent the authentication scheme using a **specific credential string**. This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-1392 **[CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials]**, which states that the product uses default credentials for potentially critical functionality.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n*   **CWE-1392 [CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials]**: The product uses default credentials (such as passwords or cryptographic keys) for potentially critical functionality.\n*   **CWE-287 [CWE-287: Improper Authentication]**: When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1392 **[CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials]** is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **use of a specific credential string** that allows an attacker to bypass authentication. While CWE-287 **[CWE-287: Improper Authentication]** is related, it is a broader classification that doesn't capture the specific nature of the weakness as accurately as CWE-1392 **[CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials]**.",
