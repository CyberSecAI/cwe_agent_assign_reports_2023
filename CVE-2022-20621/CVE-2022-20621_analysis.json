CWE-260 (Password in Configuration File) is a more specific case of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) and CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information). The vulnerability clearly states that the **access key is unencrypted** and stored in the configuration file.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe260[\"CWE-260: Password in Configuration File\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe922[\"CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe260 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe922\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weaknesses in Authentication or Authorization Protocol\"]\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe260 primary\n    class cwe312,cwe256 secondary\n    class cwe522,cwe311,cwe922,cwe1390 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **unencrypted storage of the access key** in the configuration file. This leads to the exposure of the access key to users with access to the Jenkins controller file system, potentially leading to unauthorized access or other malicious activities.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed towards CWE-260 (Password in Configuration File) as the primary candidate due to the specific mention of the access key stored **unencrypted** in a configuration file. This is supported by the vulnerability description, which states that the Jenkins Metrics Plugin stores an **access key unencrypted** in its global configuration file.\n\nThe selection of CWE-260 is further justified by the fact that it is a Base-level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities. The \"Retriever Results\" also lists CWE-260 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) and CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) were considered as secondary candidates due to their relevance to the **unencrypted storage** of sensitive information, but are not as specific as CWE-260 regarding the configuration file.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.83\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-260: Password in Configuration File\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product stores a password in a configuration file that might be accessible to actors who do not know the password.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis can result in compromise of the system for which the password is used. An attacker could gain access to this file and learn the stored password or worse yet, change the password to one of their choosing.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-522\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
