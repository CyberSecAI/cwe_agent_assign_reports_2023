It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This can be primary to many other weaknesses such as cryptographic errors, authentication errors, symlink following, information leaks, and others.\n\n**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.3, CWE-330 and its descendants are being investigated by the CWE crypto team to identify gaps related to randomness and unpredictability, as well as the relationships between randomness and cryptographic primitives. This \"subtree analysis\" might result in the addition or deprecation of existing entries; the reorganization of relationships in some views, e.g. the research view (CWE-1000); more consistent use of terminology; and/or significant modifications to related entries.\n\n**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, \"randomness\" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, \"entropy\" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-3692:** PHP framework uses mt_rand() function (Marsenne Twister) when generating tokens\n- **CVE-2020-7010:** Cloud application on Kubernetes generates passwords using a weak random number generator based on deployment time.\n- **CVE-2009-3278:** Crypto product uses rand() library function to generate a recovery key, making it easier to conduct brute force attacks.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) in a security context, but the PRNG's algorithm is not cryptographically strong.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen a non-cryptographic PRNG is used in a cryptographic context, it can expose the cryptography to certain types of attacks.\n\n\nOften a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is not designed for cryptography. Sometimes a mediocre source of randomness is sufficient or preferable for algorithms that use random numbers. Weak generators generally take less processing power and/or do not use the precious, finite, entropy sources on a system. While such PRNGs might have very useful features, these same features could be used to break the cryptography.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-330\nChildOf -> CWE-330\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29330:** Product for administering PBX systems uses predictable identifiers and timestamps for filenames (CWE-340) which allows attackers to access files via direct request (CWE-425).\n- **CVE-2001-1141:** PRNG allows attackers to use the output of small PRNG requests to determine the internal state information, which could be used by attackers to predict future pseudo-random numbers.\n- **CVE-1999-0074:** Listening TCP ports are sequentially allocated, allowing spoofing attacks.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nCryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.\n\n\nIt is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.\n\n\nSince the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered \"unsafe\" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.\n\n\nFor a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-693\nPeerOf -> CWE-311\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30273:** SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity\n- **CVE-2022-30320:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.\n- **CVE-2008-3775:** Product uses \"ROT-25\" to obfuscate the password in the registry.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n### Extended Description\nDiscrepancies can take many forms, and variations may be detectable in timing, control flow, communications such as replies or requests, or general behavior. These discrepancies can reveal information about the product's operation or internal state to an unauthorized actor. In some cases, discrepancies can be used by attackers to form a side channel.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nSide Channel Attack: Observable Discrepancies are at the root of side channel attacks.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nChildOf -> CWE-200\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-8695:** Observable discrepancy in the RAPL interface for some Intel processors allows information disclosure.\n- **CVE-2019-14353:** Crypto hardware wallet's power consumption relates to total number of pixels illuminated, creating a side channel in the USB connection that allows attackers to determine secrets displayed such as PIN numbers and passwords\n- **CVE-2019-10071:** Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis is often triggered by improper handling of malformed data or unexpectedly interrupted sessions. In some languages, developers are responsible for tracking memory allocation and releasing the memory. If there are no more pointers or references to the memory, then it can no longer be tracked and identified for release.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nMemory Leak\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-772\nChildOf -> CWE-404\nChildOf -> CWE-404\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is often a resultant weakness due to improper handling of malformed data or early termination of sessions.\n\n**[Terminology]** \"memory leak\" has sometimes been used to describe other kinds of issues, e.g. for information leaks in which the contents of memory are inadvertently leaked (CVE-2003-0400 is one such example of this terminology conflict).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2005-3119:** Memory leak because function does not free() an element of a data structure.\n- **CVE-2004-0427:** Memory leak when counter variable is not decremented.\n- **CVE-2002-0574:** chain: reference count is not decremented, leading to memory leak in OS by sending ICMP packets.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nTwo separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n### Extended Description\nIn security-relevant contexts, even small variations in timing can be exploited by attackers to indirectly infer certain details about the product's internal operations. For example, in some cryptographic algorithms, attackers can use timing differences to infer certain properties about a private key, making the key easier to guess. Timing discrepancies effectively form a timing side channel.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-203\nCanPrecede -> CWE-385\nCanPrecede -> CWE-327\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

The CWE team is developing an alternative.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-10071:** Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies\n- **CVE-2019-10482:** Smartphone OS uses comparison functions that are not in constant time, allowing side channels\n- **CVE-2014-0984:** Password-checking function in router terminates validation of a password entry when it encounters the first incorrect character, which allows remote attackers to obtain passwords via a brute-force attack that relies on timing differences in responses to incorrect password guesses, aka a timing side-channel attack.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-337: Predictable Seed in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) is initialized from a predictable seed, such as the process ID or system time.\n\n### Extended Description\nThe use of predictable seeds significantly reduces the number of possible seeds that an attacker would need to test in order to predict which random numbers will be generated by the PRNG.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-335\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-7010:** Cloud application on Kubernetes generates passwords using a weak random number generator based on deployment time.\n- **CVE-2019-11495:** server uses erlang:now() to seed the PRNG, which results in a small search space for potential random seeds\n- **CVE-2008-0166:** The removal of a couple lines of code caused Debian's OpenSSL Package to only use the current process ID for seeding a PRNG\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nChildOf -> CWE-345\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

The error message may be created in different ways:\n\n\n  - self-generated: the source code explicitly constructs the error message and delivers it\n\n  - externally-generated: the external environment, such as a language interpreter, handles the error and constructs its own message, whose contents are not under direct control by the programmer\n\nAn attacker may use the contents of error messages to help launch another, more focused attack. For example, an attempt to exploit a path traversal weakness (CWE-22) might yield the full pathname of the installed application. In turn, this could be used to select the proper number of \"..\" sequences to navigate to the targeted file. An attack using SQL injection (CWE-89) might not initially succeed, but an error message could reveal the malformed query, which would expose query logic and possibly even passwords or other sensitive information used within the query.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nChildOf -> CWE-755\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Might be resultant from another weakness.\n- **CVE-2007-5172:** Program reveals password in error message if attacker can trigger certain database errors.\n- **CVE-2008-4638:** Composite: application running with high privileges (CWE-250) allows user to specify a restricted file to process, which generates a parsing error that leaks the contents of the file (CWE-209).\n\n Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-208 CWE-203 CWE-327 CWE-330 CWE-335 CWE-338 CWE-204 CWE-226",

Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29330:** Product for administering PBX systems uses predictable identifiers and timestamps for filenames (CWE-340) which allows attackers to access files via direct request (CWE-425).\n- **CVE-2001-1141:** PRNG allows attackers to use the output of small PRNG requests to determine the internal state information, which could be used by attackers to predict future pseudo-random numbers.\n- **CVE-1999-0074:** Listening TCP ports are sequentially allocated, allowing spoofing attacks.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nCryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.\n\n\nIt is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.\n\n\nSince the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered \"unsafe\" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.\n\n\nFor a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-693\nPeerOf -> CWE-311\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30273:** SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity\n- **CVE-2022-30320:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.\n- **CVE-2008-3775:** Product uses \"ROT-25\" to obfuscate the password in the registry.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n### Extended Description\nDiscrepancies can take many forms, and variations may be detectable in timing, control flow, communications such as replies or requests, or general behavior. These discrepancies can reveal information about the product's operation or internal state to an unauthorized actor. In some cases, discrepancies can be used by attackers to form a side channel.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nSide Channel Attack: Observable Discrepancies are at the root of side channel attacks.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nChildOf -> CWE-200\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

In some languages, developers are responsible for tracking memory allocation and releasing the memory. If there are no more pointers or references to the memory, then it can no longer be tracked and identified for release.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nMemory Leak\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-772\nChildOf -> CWE-404\nChildOf -> CWE-404\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is often a resultant weakness due to improper handling of malformed data or early termination of sessions.\n\n**[Terminology]** \"memory leak\" has sometimes been used to describe other kinds of issues, e.g. for information leaks in which the contents of memory are inadvertently leaked (CVE-2003-0400 is one such example of this terminology conflict).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2005-3119:** Memory leak because function does not free() an element of a data structure.\n- **CVE-2004-0427:** Memory leak when counter variable is not decremented.\n- **CVE-2002-0574:** chain: reference count is not decremented, leading to memory leak in OS by sending ICMP packets.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nTwo separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n### Extended Description\nIn security-relevant contexts, even small variations in timing can be exploited by attackers to indirectly infer certain details about the product's internal operations. For example, in some cryptographic algorithms, attackers can use timing differences to infer certain properties about a private key, making the key easier to guess. Timing discrepancies effectively form a timing side channel.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-203\nCanPrecede -> CWE-385\nCanPrecede -> CWE-327\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

The CWE team is developing an alternative.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-10071:** Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies\n- **CVE-2019-10482:** Smartphone OS uses comparison functions that are not in constant time, allowing side channels\n- **CVE-2014-0984:** Password-checking function in router terminates validation of a password entry when it encounters the first incorrect character, which allows remote attackers to obtain passwords via a brute-force attack that relies on timing differences in responses to incorrect password guesses, aka a timing side-channel attack.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-337: Predictable Seed in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) is initialized from a predictable seed, such as the process ID or system time.\n\n### Extended Description\nThe use of predictable seeds significantly reduces the number of possible seeds that an attacker would need to test in order to predict which random numbers will be generated by the PRNG.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-335\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

The error message may be created in different ways:\n\n\n  - self-generated: the source code explicitly constructs the error message and delivers it\n\n  - externally-generated: the external environment, such as a language interpreter, handles the error and constructs its own message, whose contents are not under direct control by the programmer\n\nAn attacker may use the contents of error messages to help launch another, more focused attack. For example, an attempt to exploit a path traversal weakness (CWE-22) might yield the full pathname of the installed application. In turn, this could be used to select the proper number of \"..\" sequences to navigate to the targeted file. An attack using SQL injection (CWE-89) might not initially succeed, but an error message could reveal the malformed query, which would expose query logic and possibly even passwords or other sensitive information used within the query.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nChildOf -> CWE-755\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Sometimes a mediocre source of randomness is sufficient or preferable for algorithms that use random numbers. Weak generators generally take less processing power and/or do not use the precious, finite, entropy sources on a system. While such PRNGs might have very useful features, these same features could be used to break the cryptography.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-330\nChildOf -> CWE-330\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29330:** Product for administering PBX systems uses predictable identifiers and timestamps for filenames (CWE-340) which allows attackers to access files via direct request (CWE-425).\n- **CVE-2001-1141:** PRNG allows attackers to use the output of small PRNG requests to determine the internal state information, which could be used by attackers to predict future pseudo-random numbers.\n- **CVE-1999-0074:** Listening TCP ports are sequentially allocated, allowing spoofing attacks.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nCryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.\n\n\nIt is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.\n\n\nSince the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered \"unsafe\" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.\n\n\nFor a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-693\nPeerOf -> CWE-311\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30273:** SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity\n- **CVE-2022-30320:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.\n- **CVE-2008-3775:** Product uses \"ROT-25\" to obfuscate the password in the registry.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n### Extended Description\nDiscrepancies can take many forms, and variations may be detectable in timing, control flow, communications such as replies or requests, or general behavior. These discrepancies can reveal information about the product's operation or internal state to an unauthorized actor. In some cases, discrepancies can be used by attackers to form a side channel.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nSide Channel Attack: Observable Discrepancies are at the root of side channel attacks.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nChildOf -> CWE-200\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

In some languages, developers are responsible for tracking memory allocation and releasing the memory. If there are no more pointers or references to the memory, then it can no longer be tracked and identified for release.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nMemory Leak\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-772\nChildOf -> CWE-404\nChildOf -> CWE-404\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is often a resultant weakness due to improper handling of malformed data or early termination of sessions.\n\n**[Terminology]** \"memory leak\" has sometimes been used to describe other kinds of issues, e.g. for information leaks in which the contents of memory are inadvertently leaked (CVE-2003-0400 is one such example of this terminology conflict).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2005-3119:** Memory leak because function does not free() an element of a data structure.\n- **CVE-2004-0427:** Memory leak when counter variable is not decremented.\n- **CVE-2002-0574:** chain: reference count is not decremented, leading to memory leak in OS by sending ICMP packets.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nTwo separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n### Extended Description\nIn security-relevant contexts, even small variations in timing can be exploited by attackers to indirectly infer certain details about the product's internal operations. For example, in some cryptographic algorithms, attackers can use timing differences to infer certain properties about a private key, making the key easier to guess. Timing discrepancies effectively form a timing side channel.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-203\nCanPrecede -> CWE-385\nCanPrecede -> CWE-327\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

The error message may be created in different ways:\n\n\n  - self-generated: the source code explicitly constructs the error message and delivers it\n\n  - externally-generated: the external environment, such as a language interpreter, handles the error and constructs its own message, whose contents are not under direct control by the programmer\n\nAn attacker may use the contents of error messages to help launch another, more focused attack. For example, an attempt to exploit a path traversal weakness (CWE-22) might yield the full pathname of the installed application. In turn, this could be used to select the proper number of \"..\" sequences to navigate to the targeted file. An attack using SQL injection (CWE-89) might not initially succeed, but an error message could reveal the malformed query, which would expose query logic and possibly even passwords or other sensitive information used within the query.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nChildOf -> CWE-755\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
