This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nBuffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean \"write past the end of a buffer,\" whereas others use the same term to mean \"any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer.\" Others could mean \"any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write.\" Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.\nbuffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term \"buffer overrun,\" but most people use \"buffer overflow.\" See the alternate term for \"buffer overflow\" for context.\nmemory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the \"memory safety\" term.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-118\nChildOf -> CWE-20\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.\n**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Applicable Platform]** \n\nIt is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation.

See Terminology Notes.\nWraparound: The terms \"overflow\" and \"wraparound\" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.\nwrap, wrap-around, wrap around: Alternate spellings of \"wraparound\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with \"overflow,\" \"underflow,\" and \"wraparound\" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called \"underflows\").\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\n\"Integer overflow\" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.\n\n\nA \"wraparound\" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.\n\n\n\"Overflow\" is sometimes conflated with \"wraparound\" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.\n\n\nThe \"overflow\" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use \"overflow\" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using \"underflow\" for exceeding the minimum.\n\n\nSome people use \"overflow\" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses \"underflow\" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.\n\n\nSee [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.\n\n\n**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.\n\n### Extended Description\nA buffer overflow condition exists when a product attempts to put more data in a buffer than it can hold, or when it attempts to put data in a memory area outside of the boundaries of a buffer. The simplest type of error, and the most common cause of buffer overflows, is the \"classic\" case in which the product copies the buffer without restricting how much is copied. Other variants exist, but the existence of a classic overflow strongly suggests that the programmer is not considering even the most basic of security protections.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nClassic Buffer Overflow: This term was frequently used by vulnerability researchers during approximately 1995 to 2005 to differentiate buffer copies without length checks (which had been known about for decades) from other emerging weaknesses that still involved invalid accesses of buffers, as vulnerability researchers began to develop advanced exploitation techniques.\nUnbounded Transfer\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-123\nChildOf -> CWE-20\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** There are some indications that this CWE ID might be misused and selected simply because it mentions \"buffer overflow\" - an increasingly vague term. This CWE entry is only appropriate for \"Buffer Copy\" operations (not buffer reads), in which where there is no \"Checking [the] Size of Input\", and (by implication of the copy) writing past the end of the buffer.\n**Comments:** If the vulnerability being analyzed involves out-of-bounds reads, then consider CWE-125 or descendants. For root cause analysis: if there is any input validation, consider children of CWE-20 such as CWE-1284. If there is a calculation error for buffer sizes, consider CWE-131 or similar.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** At the code level, stack-based and heap-based overflows do not differ significantly, so there usually is not a need to distinguish them. From the attacker perspective, they can be quite different, since different techniques are required to exploit them.\n\n**[Terminology]** Many issues that are now called \"buffer overflows\" are substantively different than the \"classic\" overflow, including entirely different bug types that rely on overflow exploit techniques, such as integer signedness errors, integer overflows, and format string bugs. This imprecise terminology can make it difficult to determine which variant is being reported.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2000-1094:** buffer overflow using command with long argument\n- **CVE-1999-0046:** buffer overflow in local program using long environment variable\n- **CVE-2002-1337:** buffer overflow in comment characters, when product increments a counter for a \">\" but does not decrement for \"<\"\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-788\nChildOf -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Heap-based buffer overflows are usually just as dangerous as stack-based buffer overflows.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2007-4268:** Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOOB read: Shorthand for \"Out of bounds\" read\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.\n\n\nA race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:\n\n\n  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.\n\n  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.\n\nA race condition exists when an \"interfering code sequence\" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.\n\nThe interfering code sequence could be \"trusted\" or \"untrusted.\" A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nRace Condition\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-691\nCanPrecede -> CWE-416\nCanPrecede -> CWE-476\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed. They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.\n\n**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-190 CWE-662 CWE-366 CWE-193 CWE-125 CWE-119 CWE-1284 CWE-667 CWE-367 CWE-362",

Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called \"underflows\").\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\n\"Integer overflow\" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.\n\n\nA \"wraparound\" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.\n\n\n\"Overflow\" is sometimes conflated with \"wraparound\" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.\n\n\nThe \"overflow\" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use \"overflow\" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using \"underflow\" for exceeding the minimum.\n\n\nSome people use \"overflow\" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses \"underflow\" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.\n\n\nSee [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.\n\n\n**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.\n\n### Extended Description\nA buffer overflow condition exists when a product attempts to put more data in a buffer than it can hold, or when it attempts to put data in a memory area outside of the boundaries of a buffer. The simplest type of error, and the most common cause of buffer overflows, is the \"classic\" case in which the product copies the buffer without restricting how much is copied. Other variants exist, but the existence of a classic overflow strongly suggests that the programmer is not considering even the most basic of security protections.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nClassic Buffer Overflow: This term was frequently used by vulnerability researchers during approximately 1995 to 2005 to differentiate buffer copies without length checks (which had been known about for decades) from other emerging weaknesses that still involved invalid accesses of buffers, as vulnerability researchers began to develop advanced exploitation techniques.\nUnbounded Transfer\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-123\nChildOf -> CWE-20\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** There are some indications that this CWE ID might be misused and selected simply because it mentions \"buffer overflow\" - an increasingly vague term. This CWE entry is only appropriate for \"Buffer Copy\" operations (not buffer reads), in which where there is no \"Checking [the] Size of Input\", and (by implication of the copy) writing past the end of the buffer.\n**Comments:** If the vulnerability being analyzed involves out-of-bounds reads, then consider CWE-125 or descendants. For root cause analysis: if there is any input validation, consider children of CWE-20 such as CWE-1284. If there is a calculation error for buffer sizes, consider CWE-131 or similar.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** At the code level, stack-based and heap-based overflows do not differ significantly, so there usually is not a need to distinguish them. From the attacker perspective, they can be quite different, since different techniques are required to exploit them.\n\n**[Terminology]** Many issues that are now called \"buffer overflows\" are substantively different than the \"classic\" overflow, including entirely different bug types that rely on overflow exploit techniques, such as integer signedness errors, integer overflows, and format string bugs. This imprecise terminology can make it difficult to determine which variant is being reported.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2000-1094:** buffer overflow using command with long argument\n- **CVE-1999-0046:** buffer overflow in local program using long environment variable\n- **CVE-2002-1337:** buffer overflow in comment characters, when product increments a counter for a \">\" but does not decrement for \"<\"\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-788\nChildOf -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.\n\n\nA race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:\n\n\n  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.\n\n  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.\n\nA race condition exists when an \"interfering code sequence\" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.\n\nThe interfering code sequence could be \"trusted\" or \"untrusted.\" A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nRace Condition\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-691\nCanPrecede -> CWE-416\nCanPrecede -> CWE-476\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed. They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.\n\n**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n",

If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.\n\n### Extended Description\nA buffer overflow condition exists when a product attempts to put more data in a buffer than it can hold, or when it attempts to put data in a memory area outside of the boundaries of a buffer. The simplest type of error, and the most common cause of buffer overflows, is the \"classic\" case in which the product copies the buffer without restricting how much is copied. Other variants exist, but the existence of a classic overflow strongly suggests that the programmer is not considering even the most basic of security protections.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nClassic Buffer Overflow: This term was frequently used by vulnerability researchers during approximately 1995 to 2005 to differentiate buffer copies without length checks (which had been known about for decades) from other emerging weaknesses that still involved invalid accesses of buffers, as vulnerability researchers began to develop advanced exploitation techniques.\nUnbounded Transfer\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-123\nChildOf -> CWE-20\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** There are some indications that this CWE ID might be misused and selected simply because it mentions \"buffer overflow\" - an increasingly vague term. This CWE entry is only appropriate for \"Buffer Copy\" operations (not buffer reads), in which where there is no \"Checking [the] Size of Input\", and (by implication of the copy) writing past the end of the buffer.\n**Comments:** If the vulnerability being analyzed involves out-of-bounds reads, then consider CWE-125 or descendants. For root cause analysis: if there is any input validation, consider children of CWE-20 such as CWE-1284. If there is a calculation error for buffer sizes, consider CWE-131 or similar.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** At the code level, stack-based and heap-based overflows do not differ significantly, so there usually is not a need to distinguish them. From the attacker perspective, they can be quite different, since different techniques are required to exploit them.\n\n**[Terminology]** Many issues that are now called \"buffer overflows\" are substantively different than the \"classic\" overflow, including entirely different bug types that rely on overflow exploit techniques, such as integer signedness errors, integer overflows, and format string bugs. This imprecise terminology can make it difficult to determine which variant is being reported.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2000-1094:** buffer overflow using command with long argument\n- **CVE-1999-0046:** buffer overflow in local program using long environment variable\n- **CVE-2002-1337:** buffer overflow in comment characters, when product increments a counter for a \">\" but does not decrement for \"<\"\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-788\nChildOf -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Heap-based buffer overflows are usually just as dangerous as stack-based buffer overflows.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2007-4268:** Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOOB read: Shorthand for \"Out of bounds\" read\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Due to the ambiguity of the term, use of stack overflow to describe either circumstance is discouraged.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-788\nChildOf -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** Stack-based buffer overflows can instantiate in return address overwrites, stack pointer overwrites or frame pointer overwrites. They can also be considered function pointer overwrites, array indexer overwrites or write-what-where condition, etc.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-35395:** Stack-based buffer overflows in SFK for wifi chipset used for IoT/embedded devices, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-128: Wrap-around Error\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nWrap around errors occur whenever a value is incremented past the maximum value for its type and therefore \"wraps around\" to a very small, negative, or undefined value.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\nPeerOf -> CWE-190\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.\n\n\nA race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:\n\n\n  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.\n\n  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.\n\nA race condition exists when an \"interfering code sequence\" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.\n\nThe interfering code sequence could be \"trusted\" or \"untrusted.\" A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nRace Condition\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-691\nCanPrecede -> CWE-416\nCanPrecede -> CWE-476\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed. They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.\n\n**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-190 CWE-662 CWE-366 CWE-193 CWE-125 CWE-119 CWE-1284 CWE-667 CWE-367 CWE-362",
