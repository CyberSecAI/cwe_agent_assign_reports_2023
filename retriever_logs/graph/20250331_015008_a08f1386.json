Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause of the vulnerability, as described, is the insecure use of the `send_file` function in Flask. Specifically, the vulnerability arises because the `send_file` function is used to serve files based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization or validation, allowing attackers to specify arbitrary file paths.\n\n**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a classic path traversal issue (CWE-22). This means an attacker can manipulate input to access files and directories outside of the intended web root or working directory.\n*   **Insecure `send_file` Usage:** The specific vulnerability stems from using Flask's `send_file` function with untrusted user input. The function, when used without proper safeguards, allows an attacker to specify an absolute or relative file path, potentially accessing any file on the server.\n\n**4. Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Confidentiality Breach:** The most immediate impact is a breach of confidentiality. Attackers can read sensitive files on the server, including source code, configuration files (which might contain credentials), and other private data.\n*   **Potential Availability Issues:** While listed as \"Low\" in the CVSS score, if an attacker repeatedly requests large files or files that take a long time to process, it could cause resource exhaustion and impact the availability of the service.\n\n**5. Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, which means the attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely as long as they can access the vulnerable web service.\n\n**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit the path traversal vulnerability.\n*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and how to craft malicious file paths to traverse the directory structure.\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.\n\n**Summary of Extracted Information:**\n\n| Item                               | Description                                                                                                                                                           |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Root Cause**                     | Insecure use of Flask's `send_file` function with user-controlled path input                                                                                                |\n| **Vulnerability**                  | Path traversal (CWE-22)                                                                                                                                                |\n| **Impact**                         | Confidentiality breach (reading arbitrary files on server); Potential DoS                                                                                      |\n| **Attack Vector**                  | Network-based                                                                                                                                                          |\n| **Attacker Capabilities/Position** | No authentication required; Knowledge of vulnerability and how to manipulate file paths; Network access to the server                               |\n| **Specific Code/Function** | Flask's `send_file` function used with unsanitized user input                                                                               |\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The provided CVSS v3 vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L` further emphasizes the remote nature of the attack, low attack complexity, lack of required privileges and user interaction, a scope change, and high confidentiality impact with no integrity impact, and low impact on availability.\n* The issue comment `github/securitylab#669 (comment)` was referenced multiple times across different CVEs, suggesting a common source for the vulnerability findings by the Github security lab.\n\nThis analysis should provide a comprehensive view of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-31552, as described in the provided text.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | Base | Allowed | alternate_terms | 0.800 |\n| 2 | 36 | Absolute Path Traversal | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.373 |\n| 3 | 73 | External Control of File Name or Path | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.225 |\n| 4 | 23 | Relative Path Traversal | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.172 |\n| 5 | 59 | Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.140 |\n| 6 | 24 | Path Traversal: '../filedir' | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.565 |\n| 7 | 363 | Race Condition Enabling Link Following | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 37 | Path Traversal: '/absolute/pathname/here' | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.133 |\n| 9 | 38 | Path Traversal: '\\absolute\\pathname\\here' | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.119 |\n| 10 | 29 | Path Traversal: '\\..\\filename' | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.116 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDirectory traversal\nPath traversal: \"Path traversal\" is preferred over \"directory traversal,\" but both terms are attack-focused.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add \".txt\" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.\n\n**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.\n\n**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing \"/\" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nLike other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use \"directory traversal\" only to refer to the injection of \"..\" and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.\n\n\nOther variants like \"absolute pathname\" and \"drive letter\" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve \"..\" or equivalent.\n\n\n**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.\n\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nIncomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that \"..\\\" is vulnerable, but not test \"../\" which may also be vulnerable.\n\n\nAny combination of directory separators (\"/\", \"\\\", etc.) and numbers of \".\" (e.g. \"....\") can produce unique variants; for example, the \"//../\" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama\n- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the \"\\\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as \"/abs/path\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-22\nChildOf -> CWE-22\nChildOf -> CWE-22\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-31503:** Python package constructs filenames using an unsafe os.path.join call on untrusted input, allowing absolute path traversal because os.path.join resets the pathname to an absolute path that is specified as part of the input.\n- **CVE-2002-1345:** Multiple FTP clients write arbitrary files via absolute paths in server responses\n- **CVE-2001-1269:** ZIP file extractor allows full path\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis could allow an attacker to access or modify system files or other files that are critical to the application.\n\n\nPath manipulation errors occur when the following two conditions are met:\n\n```\n\t\t1. An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.\n\t\t2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.\n```\nFor example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-642\nChildOf -> CWE-610\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-22\nCanPrecede -> CWE-41\nCanPrecede -> CWE-98\nCanPrecede -> CWE-434\nCanPrecede -> CWE-59\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** CWE-114 is a Class, but it is listed a child of CWE-73 in view 1000. This suggests some abstraction problems that should be resolved in future versions.\n\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThe external control of filenames can be the primary link in chains with other file-related weaknesses, as seen in the CanPrecede relationships. This is because software systems use files for many different purposes: to execute programs, load code libraries, to store application data, to store configuration settings, record temporary data, act as signals or semaphores to other processes, etc.\n\n\nHowever, those weaknesses do not always require external control. For example, link-following weaknesses (CWE-59) often involve pathnames that are not controllable by the attacker at all.\n\n\nThe external control can be resultant from other issues. For example, in PHP applications, the register_globals setting can allow an attacker to modify variables that the programmer thought were immutable, enabling file inclusion (CWE-98) and path traversal (CWE-22). Operating with excessive privileges (CWE-250) might allow an attacker to specify an input filename that is not directly readable by the attacker, but is accessible to the privileged program. A buffer overflow (CWE-119) might give an attacker control over nearby memory locations that are related to pathnames, but were not directly modifiable by the attacker.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n- **CVE-2008-5748:** Chain: external control of values for user's desired language and theme enables path traversal.\n- **CVE-2008-5764:** Chain: external control of user's target language enables remote file inclusion.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nZip Slip: \"Zip slip\" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282].

An attacker could cause the product to slow down (e.g. with memory consumption), causing the time window to become larger. Alternately, in some situations, the attacker could win the race by performing a large number of attacks.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-367\nCanPrecede -> CWE-59\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause of the vulnerability, as described, is the insecure use of the `send_file` function in Flask. Specifically, the vulnerability arises because the `send_file` function is used to serve files based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization or validation, allowing attackers to specify arbitrary file paths.\n\n**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a classic path traversal issue (CWE-22). This means an attacker can manipulate input to access files and directories outside of the intended web root or working directory.\n*   **Insecure `send_file` Usage:** The specific vulnerability stems from using Flask's `send_file` function with untrusted user input. The function, when used without proper safeguards, allows an attacker to specify an absolute or relative file path, potentially accessing any file on the server.\n\n**4. Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Confidentiality Breach:** The most immediate impact is a breach of confidentiality. Attackers can read sensitive files on the server, including source code, configuration files (which might contain credentials), and other private data.\n*   **Potential Availability Issues:** While listed as \"Low\" in the CVSS score, if an attacker repeatedly requests large files or files that take a long time to process, it could cause resource exhaustion and impact the availability of the service.\n\n**5.

Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit the path traversal vulnerability.\n*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and how to craft malicious file paths to traverse the directory structure.\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.\n\n**Summary of Extracted Information:**\n\n| Item                               | Description                                                                                                                                                           |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Root Cause**                     | Insecure use of Flask's `send_file` function with user-controlled path input                                                                                                |\n| **Vulnerability**                  | Path traversal (CWE-22)                                                                                                                                                |\n| **Impact**                         | Confidentiality breach (reading arbitrary files on server); Potential DoS                                                                                      |\n| **Attack Vector**                  | Network-based                                                                                                                                                          |\n| **Attacker Capabilities/Position** | No authentication required; Knowledge of vulnerability and how to manipulate file paths; Network access to the server                               |\n| **Specific Code/Function** | Flask's `send_file` function used with unsanitized user input                                                                               |\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The provided CVSS v3 vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L` further emphasizes the remote nature of the attack, low attack complexity, lack of required privileges and user interaction, a scope change, and high confidentiality impact with no integrity impact, and low impact on availability.\n* The issue comment `github/securitylab#669 (comment)` was referenced multiple times across different CVEs, suggesting a common source for the vulnerability findings by the Github security lab.\n\nThis analysis should provide a comprehensive view of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-31552, as described in the provided text.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | Base | Allowed | alternate_terms | 0.800 |\n| 2 | 36 | Absolute Path Traversal | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.373 |\n| 3 | 73 | External Control of File Name or Path | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.225 |\n| 4 | 23 | Relative Path Traversal | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.172 |\n| 5 | 59 | Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.140 |\n| 6 | 24 | Path Traversal: '../filedir' | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.565 |\n| 7 | 363 | Race Condition Enabling Link Following | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 37 | Path Traversal: '/absolute/pathname/here' | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.133 |\n| 9 | 38 | Path Traversal: '\\absolute\\pathname\\here' | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.119 |\n| 10 | 29 | Path Traversal: '\\..\\filename' | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.116 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDirectory traversal\nPath traversal: \"Path traversal\" is preferred over \"directory traversal,\" but both terms are attack-focused.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add \".txt\" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.\n\n**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.\n\n**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing \"/\" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nLike other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use \"directory traversal\" only to refer to the injection of \"..\" and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.\n\n\nOther variants like \"absolute pathname\" and \"drive letter\" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve \"..\" or equivalent.\n\n\n**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.\n\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nIncomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that \"..\\\" is vulnerable, but not test \"../\" which may also be vulnerable.\n\n\nAny combination of directory separators (\"/\", \"\\\", etc.) and numbers of \".\" (e.g. \"....\") can produce unique variants; for example, the \"//../\" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama\n- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the \"\\\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as \"/abs/path\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-22\nChildOf -> CWE-22\nChildOf -> CWE-22\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-31503:** Python package constructs filenames using an unsafe os.path.join call on untrusted input, allowing absolute path traversal because os.path.join resets the pathname to an absolute path that is specified as part of the input.\n- **CVE-2002-1345:** Multiple FTP clients write arbitrary files via absolute paths in server responses\n- **CVE-2001-1269:** ZIP file extractor allows full path\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis could allow an attacker to access or modify system files or other files that are critical to the application.\n\n\nPath manipulation errors occur when the following two conditions are met:\n\n```\n\t\t1. An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.\n\t\t2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.\n```\nFor example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-642\nChildOf -> CWE-610\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-22\nCanPrecede -> CWE-41\nCanPrecede -> CWE-98\nCanPrecede -> CWE-434\nCanPrecede -> CWE-59\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** CWE-114 is a Class, but it is listed a child of CWE-73 in view 1000. This suggests some abstraction problems that should be resolved in future versions.\n\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThe external control of filenames can be the primary link in chains with other file-related weaknesses, as seen in the CanPrecede relationships. This is because software systems use files for many different purposes: to execute programs, load code libraries, to store application data, to store configuration settings, record temporary data, act as signals or semaphores to other processes, etc.\n\n\nHowever, those weaknesses do not always require external control. For example, link-following weaknesses (CWE-59) often involve pathnames that are not controllable by the attacker at all.\n\n\nThe external control can be resultant from other issues. For example, in PHP applications, the register_globals setting can allow an attacker to modify variables that the programmer thought were immutable, enabling file inclusion (CWE-98) and path traversal (CWE-22). Operating with excessive privileges (CWE-250) might allow an attacker to specify an input filename that is not directly readable by the attacker, but is accessible to the privileged program. A buffer overflow (CWE-119) might give an attacker control over nearby memory locations that are related to pathnames, but were not directly modifiable by the attacker.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n- **CVE-2008-5748:** Chain: external control of values for user's desired language and theme enables path traversal.\n- **CVE-2008-5764:** Chain: external control of user's target language enables remote file inclusion.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nZip Slip: \"Zip slip\" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282].

They are the combination of multiple elements: file or directory permissions, filename predictability, race conditions, and in some cases, a design limitation in which there is no mechanism for performing atomic file creation operations.\n\n\nSome potential factors are race conditions, permissions, and predictability.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-1386:** Some versions of Perl follow symbolic links when running with the -e option, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.\n- **CVE-2000-1178:** Text editor follows symbolic links when creating a rescue copy during an abnormal exit, which allows local users to overwrite the files of other users.\n- **CVE-2004-0217:** Antivirus update allows local users to create or append to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a logfile.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-24: Path Traversal: '../filedir'\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize \"../\" sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.\n\n\nThe \"../\" manipulation is the canonical manipulation for operating systems that use \"/\" as directory separators, such as UNIX- and Linux-based systems. In some cases, it is useful for bypassing protection schemes in environments for which \"/\" is supported but not the primary separator, such as Windows, which uses \"\\\" but can also accept \"/\".\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-23\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

An attacker could cause the product to slow down (e.g. with memory consumption), causing the time window to become larger. Alternately, in some situations, the attacker could win the race by performing a large number of attacks.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-367\nCanPrecede -> CWE-59\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause of the vulnerability, as described, is the insecure use of the `send_file` function in Flask. Specifically, the vulnerability arises because the `send_file` function is used to serve files based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization or validation, allowing attackers to specify arbitrary file paths.\n\n**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a classic path traversal issue (CWE-22). This means an attacker can manipulate input to access files and directories outside of the intended web root or working directory.\n*   **Insecure `send_file` Usage:** The specific vulnerability stems from using Flask's `send_file` function with untrusted user input. The function, when used without proper safeguards, allows an attacker to specify an absolute or relative file path, potentially accessing any file on the server.\n\n**4. Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Confidentiality Breach:** The most immediate impact is a breach of confidentiality. Attackers can read sensitive files on the server, including source code, configuration files (which might contain credentials), and other private data.\n*   **Potential Availability Issues:** While listed as \"Low\" in the CVSS score, if an attacker repeatedly requests large files or files that take a long time to process, it could cause resource exhaustion and impact the availability of the service.\n\n**5. Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, which means the attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely as long as they can access the vulnerable web service.\n\n**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit the path traversal vulnerability.\n*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and how to craft malicious file paths to traverse the directory structure.\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.\n\n**Summary of Extracted Information:**\n\n| Item                               | Description                                                                                                                                                           |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Root Cause**                     | Insecure use of Flask's `send_file` function with user-controlled path input                                                                                                |\n| **Vulnerability**                  | Path traversal (CWE-22)                                                                                                                                                |\n| **Impact**                         | Confidentiality breach (reading arbitrary files on server); Potential DoS                                                                                      |\n| **Attack Vector**                  | Network-based                                                                                                                                                          |\n| **Attacker Capabilities/Position** | No authentication required; Knowledge of vulnerability and how to manipulate file paths; Network access to the server                               |\n| **Specific Code/Function** | Flask's `send_file` function used with unsanitized user input                                                                               |\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The provided CVSS v3 vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L` further emphasizes the remote nature of the attack, low attack complexity, lack of required privileges and user interaction, a scope change, and high confidentiality impact with no integrity impact, and low impact on availability.\n* The issue comment `github/securitylab#669 (comment)` was referenced multiple times across different CVEs, suggesting a common source for the vulnerability findings by the Github security lab.\n\nThis analysis should provide a comprehensive view of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-31552, as described in the provided text.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | Base | Allowed | alternate_terms | 0.800 |\n| 2 | 36 | Absolute Path Traversal | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.373 |\n| 3 | 73 | External Control of File Name or Path | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.225 |\n| 4 | 23 | Relative Path Traversal | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.172 |\n| 5 | 59 | Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.140 |\n| 6 | 24 | Path Traversal: '../filedir' | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.565 |\n| 7 | 363 | Race Condition Enabling Link Following | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 37 | Path Traversal: '/absolute/pathname/here' | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.133 |\n| 9 | 38 | Path Traversal: '\\absolute\\pathname\\here' | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.119 |\n| 10 | 29 | Path Traversal: '\\..\\filename' | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.116 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDirectory traversal\nPath traversal: \"Path traversal\" is preferred over \"directory traversal,\" but both terms are attack-focused.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add \".txt\" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.\n\n**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.\n\n**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing \"/\" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nLike other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use \"directory traversal\" only to refer to the injection of \"..\" and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.\n\n\nOther variants like \"absolute pathname\" and \"drive letter\" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve \"..\" or equivalent.\n\n\n**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.\n\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nIncomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that \"..\\\" is vulnerable, but not test \"../\" which may also be vulnerable.\n\n\nAny combination of directory separators (\"/\", \"\\\", etc.) and numbers of \".\" (e.g. \"....\") can produce unique variants; for example, the \"//../\" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama\n- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the \"\\\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as \"/abs/path\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-22\nChildOf -> CWE-22\nChildOf -> CWE-22\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-31503:** Python package constructs filenames using an unsafe os.path.join call on untrusted input, allowing absolute path traversal because os.path.join resets the pathname to an absolute path that is specified as part of the input.\n- **CVE-2002-1345:** Multiple FTP clients write arbitrary files via absolute paths in server responses\n- **CVE-2001-1269:** ZIP file extractor allows full path\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis could allow an attacker to access or modify system files or other files that are critical to the application.\n\n\nPath manipulation errors occur when the following two conditions are met:\n\n```\n\t\t1. An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.\n\t\t2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.\n```\nFor example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-642\nChildOf -> CWE-610\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-22\nCanPrecede -> CWE-41\nCanPrecede -> CWE-98\nCanPrecede -> CWE-434\nCanPrecede -> CWE-59\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** CWE-114 is a Class, but it is listed a child of CWE-73 in view 1000. This suggests some abstraction problems that should be resolved in future versions.\n\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThe external control of filenames can be the primary link in chains with other file-related weaknesses, as seen in the CanPrecede relationships. This is because software systems use files for many different purposes: to execute programs, load code libraries, to store application data, to store configuration settings, record temporary data, act as signals or semaphores to other processes, etc.\n\n\nHowever, those weaknesses do not always require external control. For example, link-following weaknesses (CWE-59) often involve pathnames that are not controllable by the attacker at all.\n\n\nThe external control can be resultant from other issues. For example, in PHP applications, the register_globals setting can allow an attacker to modify variables that the programmer thought were immutable, enabling file inclusion (CWE-98) and path traversal (CWE-22). Operating with excessive privileges (CWE-250) might allow an attacker to specify an input filename that is not directly readable by the attacker, but is accessible to the privileged program. A buffer overflow (CWE-119) might give an attacker control over nearby memory locations that are related to pathnames, but were not directly modifiable by the attacker.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n- **CVE-2008-5748:** Chain: external control of values for user's desired language and theme enables path traversal.\n- **CVE-2008-5764:** Chain: external control of user's target language enables remote file inclusion.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nZip Slip: \"Zip slip\" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282].

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Theoretical]** \n\nLink following vulnerabilities are Multi-factor Vulnerabilities (MFV). They are the combination of multiple elements: file or directory permissions, filename predictability, race conditions, and in some cases, a design limitation in which there is no mechanism for performing atomic file creation operations.\n\n\nSome potential factors are race conditions, permissions, and predictability.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-1386:** Some versions of Perl follow symbolic links when running with the -e option, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.\n- **CVE-2000-1178:** Text editor follows symbolic links when creating a rescue copy during an abnormal exit, which allows local users to overwrite the files of other users.\n- **CVE-2004-0217:** Antivirus update allows local users to create or append to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a logfile.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-24: Path Traversal: '../filedir'\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize \"../\" sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.\n\n\nThe \"../\" manipulation is the canonical manipulation for operating systems that use \"/\" as directory separators, such as UNIX- and Linux-based systems. In some cases, it is useful for bypassing protection schemes in environments for which \"/\" is supported but not the primary separator, such as Windows, which uses \"\\\" but can also accept \"/\".\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-23\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

An attacker could cause the product to slow down (e.g. with memory consumption), causing the time window to become larger. Alternately, in some situations, the attacker could win the race by performing a large number of attacks.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-367\nCanPrecede -> CWE-59\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

It is included here because so many people associate race conditions with link problems; however, not all link following issues involve race conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-37: Path Traversal: '/absolute/pathname/here'\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product accepts input in the form of a slash absolute path ('/absolute/pathname/here') without appropriate validation, which can allow an attacker to traverse the file system to unintended locations or access arbitrary files.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-36\nChildOf -> CWE-160\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Sometimes a program checks for \"..\\\" at the beginning of the input, so a \"\\..\\\" can bypass that check. It is also useful for bypassing path traversal protection schemes that only assume that the \"/\" separator is valid.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-23\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
