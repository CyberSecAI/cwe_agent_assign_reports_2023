An attacker can change password of all users without knowing victims original password.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **Insecure Permissions**\n- **impact:** change password of all users\n- **attacker:** attacker\n- **product:** Gnuboard\n- **version:** 5.5.4 and 5.5.5\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the patch:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause lies in how the password reset process was handled after a user completed the \"Find Password\" process using a third-party authentication (like INICIS). Specifically, the session variables `ss_cert_mb_id` and `ss_cert_dupinfo`, which store the user's ID and a unique identifier after successful authentication, were not being properly used to identify the user when updating the password. The password update query was missing the `mb_dupinfo` check, allowing a user to potentially change the password of another user if they knew their user ID.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n1.  **Insecure Password Reset Logic:** The core issue was the lack of proper validation when updating the password after a user has gone through the password reset process. The system only checked for the user ID (`mb_id`) but not the unique identifier (`mb_dupinfo`) that was stored in the session, making it vulnerable to unauthorized password changes if the attacker knows an existing user's ID.\n2.  **Missing Session Validation:**  The `password_reset_update.php` file was missing the session check before updating the password. This is where the primary issue was, as the system was not properly validating the session variables set during the identification process.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Unauthorized Password Changes:** An attacker could potentially change the password of any user if they know the user's ID by bypassing the session validation and exploiting the lack of the `mb_dupinfo` check.\n*   **Account Takeover:** Successfully changing a user's password would lead to account takeover, allowing the attacker to access the victim's account and perform any actions within it.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n1.  **Knowledge of User ID:** The attacker needs to know the target user's ID to initiate the password reset process.\n2.  **Bypassing Authentication:** By submitting a password change request without valid session variables, specifically the `mb_dupinfo` variable, the attacker could manipulate the `password_reset_update.php` script to update the password of a user if they knew their ID.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to know a valid user ID on the vulnerable system\n*   The attacker needs to be able to access the password reset functionality which is accessible to users looking to reset their passwords\n\n**Additional details:**\n\nThe provided information includes a commit log that specifies the changes made to fix this vulnerability. It is clear that the patch focuses on correcting the logic in `bbs/password_reset_update.php` to include the `mb_dupinfo` check in the SQL update query and proper validation and setting of the session variables in other files related to third-party authentication plugins. The commit includes changes to the following files:\n\n*   `bbs/password_reset_update.php`: The core fix is here, ensuring the correct `mb_dupinfo` is checked when updating the password.\n*   `mobile/skin/member/basic/password_reset.skin.php` and `skin/member/basic/password_reset.skin.php`: These files were slightly changed to include the user ID from the previous stage, which might not directly relate to the security vulnerability, but are part of the same commit.\n*   `plugin/inicert/ini_find_result.php`, `plugin/kcpcert/find_kcpcert_result.php`, `plugin/lgxpay/find_AuthOnlyRes.php`, `plugin/okname/find_hpcert2.php`, `plugin/okname/find_ipin2.php`: These files are all related to handling the results of third-party authentication services. They are modified to properly set session variables, including `ss_cert_mb_id` and `ss_cert_dupinfo`\n\nThe patch ensures that the password change is only applied to the user who actually went through the password reset process, thus fixing the insecure password reset functionality.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 732 | Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.177 |\n| 2 | 1188 | Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.175 |\n| 3 | 639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.174 |\n| 4 | 522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.169 |\n| 5 | 620 | Unverified Password Change | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.168 |\n| 6 | 256 | Plaintext Storage of a Password | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.504 |\n| 7 | 386 | Symbolic Name not Mapping to Correct Object | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 276 | Incorrect Default Permissions | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.168 |\n| 9 | 306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.167 |\n| 10 | 379 | Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.165 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties.

One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n- **CVE-2009-3482:** Anti-virus product sets insecure \"Everyone: Full Control\" permissions for files under the \"Program Files\" folder, allowing attackers to replace executables with Trojan horses.\n- **CVE-2009-3897:** Product creates directories with 0777 permissions at installation, allowing users to gain privileges and access a socket used for authentication.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nDevelopers often choose default values that leave the product as open and easy to use as possible out-of-the-box, under the assumption that the administrator can (or should) change the default value. However, this ease-of-use comes at a cost when the default is insecure and the administrator does not change it.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1419\nChildOf -> CWE-665\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry improves organization of concepts under initialization. The typical CWE model is to cover \"Missing\" and \"Incorrect\" behaviors. Arguably, this entry could be named as \"Incorrect\" instead of \"Insecure.\" This might be changed in the near future.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-36349:** insecure default variable initialization in BIOS firmware for a hardware board allows DoS\n- **CVE-2022-42467:** A generic database browser interface has a default mode that exposes a web server to the network, allowing queries to the database.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nRetrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.\n\n\nFor example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.\n\n\nOne manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nInsecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The \"Insecure Direct Object Reference\" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.\nBroken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.\nHorizontal Authorization: \"Horizontal Authorization\" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-863\nChildOf -> CWE-863\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-36539:** An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30018:** A messaging platform serializes all elements of User/Group objects, making private information available to adversaries\n- **CVE-2022-29959:** Initialization file contains credentials that can be decoded using a \"simple string transformation\"\n- **CVE-2022-35411:** Python-based RPC framework enables pickle functionality by default, allowing clients to unpickle untrusted data.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-620: Unverified Password Change\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nWhen setting a new password for a user, the product does not require knowledge of the original password, or using another form of authentication.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis could be used by an attacker to change passwords for another user, thus gaining the privileges associated with that user.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-522\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Since the file is visible, the application that is using the temporary file could be known. If one has access to list the processes on the system, the attacker has gained information about what the user is doing at that time. By correlating this with the applications the user is running, an attacker could potentially discover what a user's actions are. From this, higher levels of security could be breached.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-377\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

    "enhanced_query": "## Vulnerability Description\nGnuboard 5.5.4 and 5.5.5 is vulnerable to **Insecure Permissions**. An attacker can change password of all users without knowing victims original password.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **Insecure Permissions**\n- **impact:** change password of all users\n- **attacker:** attacker\n- **product:** Gnuboard\n- **version:** 5.5.4 and 5.5.5\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the patch:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause lies in how the password reset process was handled after a user completed the \"Find Password\" process using a third-party authentication (like INICIS). Specifically, the session variables `ss_cert_mb_id` and `ss_cert_dupinfo`, which store the user's ID and a unique identifier after successful authentication, were not being properly used to identify the user when updating the password. The password update query was missing the `mb_dupinfo` check, allowing a user to potentially change the password of another user if they knew their user ID.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n1.  **Insecure Password Reset Logic:** The core issue was the lack of proper validation when updating the password after a user has gone through the password reset process. The system only checked for the user ID (`mb_id`) but not the unique identifier (`mb_dupinfo`) that was stored in the session, making it vulnerable to unauthorized password changes if the attacker knows an existing user's ID.\n2.  **Missing Session Validation:**  The `password_reset_update.php` file was missing the session check before updating the password. This is where the primary issue was, as the system was not properly validating the session variables set during the identification process.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Unauthorized Password Changes:** An attacker could potentially change the password of any user if they know the user's ID by bypassing the session validation and exploiting the lack of the `mb_dupinfo` check.\n*   **Account Takeover:** Successfully changing a user's password would lead to account takeover, allowing the attacker to access the victim's account and perform any actions within it.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n1.  **Knowledge of User ID:** The attacker needs to know the target user's ID to initiate the password reset process.\n2.  **Bypassing Authentication:** By submitting a password change request without valid session variables, specifically the `mb_dupinfo` variable, the attacker could manipulate the `password_reset_update.php` script to update the password of a user if they knew their ID.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to know a valid user ID on the vulnerable system\n*   The attacker needs to be able to access the password reset functionality which is accessible to users looking to reset their passwords\n\n**Additional details:**\n\nThe provided information includes a commit log that specifies the changes made to fix this vulnerability. It is clear that the patch focuses on correcting the logic in `bbs/password_reset_update.php` to include the `mb_dupinfo` check in the SQL update query and proper validation and setting of the session variables in other files related to third-party authentication plugins. The commit includes changes to the following files:\n\n*   `bbs/password_reset_update.php`: The core fix is here, ensuring the correct `mb_dupinfo` is checked when updating the password.\n*   `mobile/skin/member/basic/password_reset.skin.php` and `skin/member/basic/password_reset.skin.php`: These files were slightly changed to include the user ID from the previous stage, which might not directly relate to the security vulnerability, but are part of the same commit.\n*   `plugin/inicert/ini_find_result.php`, `plugin/kcpcert/find_kcpcert_result.php`, `plugin/lgxpay/find_AuthOnlyRes.php`, `plugin/okname/find_hpcert2.php`, `plugin/okname/find_ipin2.php`: These files are all related to handling the results of third-party authentication services. They are modified to properly set session variables, including `ss_cert_mb_id` and `ss_cert_dupinfo`\n\nThe patch ensures that the password change is only applied to the user who actually went through the password reset process, thus fixing the insecure password reset functionality.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 732 | Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.177 |\n| 2 | 1188 | Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.175 |\n| 3 | 639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.174 |\n| 4 | 522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.169 |\n| 5 | 620 | Unverified Password Change | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.168 |\n| 6 | 256 | Plaintext Storage of a Password | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.504 |\n| 7 | 386 | Symbolic Name not Mapping to Correct Object | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 276 | Incorrect Default Permissions | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.168 |\n| 9 | 306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.167 |\n| 10 | 379 | Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.165 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which \"permissions\" are not checked, which is an \"authorization\" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].\n**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n- **CVE-2009-3482:** Anti-virus product sets insecure \"Everyone: Full Control\" permissions for files under the \"Program Files\" folder, allowing attackers to replace executables with Trojan horses.\n- **CVE-2009-3897:** Product creates directories with 0777 permissions at installation, allowing users to gain privileges and access a socket used for authentication.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nDevelopers often choose default values that leave the product as open and easy to use as possible out-of-the-box, under the assumption that the administrator can (or should) change the default value. However, this ease-of-use comes at a cost when the default is insecure and the administrator does not change it.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1419\nChildOf -> CWE-665\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Arguably, this entry could be named as \"Incorrect\" instead of \"Insecure.\" This might be changed in the near future.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-36349:** insecure default variable initialization in BIOS firmware for a hardware board allows DoS\n- **CVE-2022-42467:** A generic database browser interface has a default mode that exposes a web server to the network, allowing queries to the database.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nRetrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.\n\n\nFor example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally.

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-27818:** A hotkey daemon written in Rust creates a domain socket file underneath /tmp, which is accessible by any user.\n- **CVE-2021-21290:** A Java-based application for a rapid-development framework uses File.createTempFile() to create a random temporary file with insecure default permissions.\n\n Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-276 CWE-668 CWE-732 CWE-639 CWE-1188 CWE-798 CWE-306 CWE-1391 CWE-863",
