When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nInput validation is not the only technique for processing input, however. Other techniques attempt to transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well (see CWE-138 for more examples.)\n\n\nInput validation can be applied to:\n\n\n  - raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.\n\n  - metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size\n\nData can be simple or structured. Structured data can be composed of many nested layers, composed of combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or structured data.\n\nMany properties of raw data or metadata may need to be validated upon entry into the code, such as:\n\n\n  - specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.\n\n  - implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size\n\n  - indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures\n\n  - symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.\n\n  - well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax \n\n  - lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token\n\n  - specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)\n\n  - consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.\n\n  - conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic \n\n  - equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same\n\n  - authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data\n\nImplied or derived properties of data must often be calculated or inferred by the code itself. Errors in deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor to improper input validation. \n\nNote that \"input validation\" has very different meanings to different people, or within different classification schemes. Caution must be used when referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it. For example, some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control to an attacker over an input when they should not be able to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred to as input validation.\n\n\nFinally, it is important to emphasize that the distinctions between input validation and output escaping are often blurred, and developers must be careful to understand the difference, including how input validation is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, this valid name cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\nPeerOf -> CWE-345\nCanPrecede -> CWE-22\nCanPrecede -> CWE-41\nCanPrecede -> CWE-74\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-770\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis. It is also a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Consider lower-level children such as Improper Use of Validation Framework (CWE-1173) or improper validation involving specific types or properties of input such as Specified Quantity (CWE-1284); Specified Index, Position, or Offset (CWE-1285); Syntactic Correctness (CWE-1286); Specified Type (CWE-1287); Consistency within Input (CWE-1288); or Unsafe Equivalence (CWE-1289).\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-1284: Specified Quantity\n- CWE-1285: Specified Index, Position, or Offset\n- CWE-1286: Syntactic Correctness\n- CWE-1287: Specified Type\n- CWE-1288: Consistency within Input\n- CWE-1289: Unsafe Equivalence\n- CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nCWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.\n\n\n**[Maintenance]** As of 2020, this entry is used more often than preferred, and it is a source of frequent confusion. It is being actively modified for CWE 4.1 and subsequent versions.\n\n**[Maintenance]** Concepts such as validation, data transformation, and neutralization are being refined, so relationships between CWE-20 and other entries such as CWE-707 may change in future versions, along with an update to the Vulnerability Theory document.\n\n**[Maintenance]** Input validation - whether missing or incorrect - is such an essential and widespread part of secure development that it is implicit in many different weaknesses. Traditionally, problems such as buffer overflows and XSS have been classified as input validation problems by many security professionals. However, input validation is not necessarily the only protection mechanism available for avoiding such problems, and in some cases it is not even sufficient. The CWE team has begun capturing these subtleties in chains within the Research Concepts view (CWE-1000), but more work is needed.\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nThe \"input validation\" term is extremely common, but it is used in many different ways. In some cases its usage can obscure the real underlying weakness or otherwise hide chaining and composite relationships.\n\n\nSome people use \"input validation\" as a general term that covers many different neutralization techniques for ensuring that input is appropriate, such as filtering, canonicalization, and escaping. Others use the term in a more narrow context to simply mean \"checking if an input conforms to expectations without changing it.\" CWE uses this more narrow interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n- **CVE-2021-30860:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) leads to integer overflow (CWE-190) in mobile OS, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nSpecified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-789\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

The product might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the product might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nPeerOf -> CWE-322\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).\n- **CVE-2021-22909:** Chain: router's firmware update procedure uses curl with \"-k\" (insecure) option that disables certificate validation (CWE-295), allowing adversary-in-the-middle (AITM) compromise with a malicious firmware image (CWE-494).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen the length value exceeds the size of the destination, a buffer overflow could occur.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-400\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nChildOf -> CWE-400\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).\n\n**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. \"Resource exhaustion\" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..\n- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-788\nChildOf -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nInput validation is not the only technique for processing input, however. Other techniques attempt to transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well (see CWE-138 for more examples.)\n\n\nInput validation can be applied to:\n\n\n  - raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.\n\n  - metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size\n\nData can be simple or structured. Structured data can be composed of many nested layers, composed of combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or structured data.\n\nMany properties of raw data or metadata may need to be validated upon entry into the code, such as:\n\n\n  - specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.\n\n  - implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size\n\n  - indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures\n\n  - symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.\n\n  - well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax \n\n  - lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token\n\n  - specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)\n\n  - consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.\n\n  - conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic \n\n  - equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same\n\n  - authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data\n\nImplied or derived properties of data must often be calculated or inferred by the code itself. Errors in deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor to improper input validation. \n\nNote that \"input validation\" has very different meanings to different people, or within different classification schemes. Caution must be used when referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it. For example, some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control to an attacker over an input when they should not be able to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred to as input validation.\n\n\nFinally, it is important to emphasize that the distinctions between input validation and output escaping are often blurred, and developers must be careful to understand the difference, including how input validation is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, this valid name cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\nPeerOf -> CWE-345\nCanPrecede -> CWE-22\nCanPrecede -> CWE-41\nCanPrecede -> CWE-74\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-770\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis. It is also a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Consider lower-level children such as Improper Use of Validation Framework (CWE-1173) or improper validation involving specific types or properties of input such as Specified Quantity (CWE-1284); Specified Index, Position, or Offset (CWE-1285); Syntactic Correctness (CWE-1286); Specified Type (CWE-1287); Consistency within Input (CWE-1288); or Unsafe Equivalence (CWE-1289).\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-1284: Specified Quantity\n- CWE-1285: Specified Index, Position, or Offset\n- CWE-1286: Syntactic Correctness\n- CWE-1287: Specified Type\n- CWE-1288: Consistency within Input\n- CWE-1289: Unsafe Equivalence\n- CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nCWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.\n\n\n**[Maintenance]** As of 2020, this entry is used more often than preferred, and it is a source of frequent confusion. It is being actively modified for CWE 4.1 and subsequent versions.\n\n**[Maintenance]** Concepts such as validation, data transformation, and neutralization are being refined, so relationships between CWE-20 and other entries such as CWE-707 may change in future versions, along with an update to the Vulnerability Theory document.\n\n**[Maintenance]** Input validation - whether missing or incorrect - is such an essential and widespread part of secure development that it is implicit in many different weaknesses. Traditionally, problems such as buffer overflows and XSS have been classified as input validation problems by many security professionals. However, input validation is not necessarily the only protection mechanism available for avoiding such problems, and in some cases it is not even sufficient. The CWE team has begun capturing these subtleties in chains within the Research Concepts view (CWE-1000), but more work is needed.\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nThe \"input validation\" term is extremely common, but it is used in many different ways. In some cases its usage can obscure the real underlying weakness or otherwise hide chaining and composite relationships.\n\n\nSome people use \"input validation\" as a general term that covers many different neutralization techniques for ensuring that input is appropriate, such as filtering, canonicalization, and escaping. Others use the term in a more narrow context to simply mean \"checking if an input conforms to expectations without changing it.\" CWE uses this more narrow interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a.

Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-789\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-400\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nChildOf -> CWE-400\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..\n- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-788\nChildOf -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Structured data can be composed of many nested layers, composed of combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or structured data.\n\nMany properties of raw data or metadata may need to be validated upon entry into the code, such as:\n\n\n  - specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.\n\n  - implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size\n\n  - indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures\n\n  - symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.\n\n  - well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax \n\n  - lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token\n\n  - specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)\n\n  - consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.\n\n  - conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic \n\n  - equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same\n\n  - authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data\n\nImplied or derived properties of data must often be calculated or inferred by the code itself. Errors in deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor to improper input validation. \n\nNote that \"input validation\" has very different meanings to different people, or within different classification schemes. Caution must be used when referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it. For example, some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control to an attacker over an input when they should not be able to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred to as input validation.\n\n\nFinally, it is important to emphasize that the distinctions between input validation and output escaping are often blurred, and developers must be careful to understand the difference, including how input validation is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, this valid name cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\nPeerOf -> CWE-345\nCanPrecede -> CWE-22\nCanPrecede -> CWE-41\nCanPrecede -> CWE-74\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-770\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis. It is also a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Consider lower-level children such as Improper Use of Validation Framework (CWE-1173) or improper validation involving specific types or properties of input such as Specified Quantity (CWE-1284); Specified Index, Position, or Offset (CWE-1285); Syntactic Correctness (CWE-1286); Specified Type (CWE-1287); Consistency within Input (CWE-1288); or Unsafe Equivalence (CWE-1289).\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-1284: Specified Quantity\n- CWE-1285: Specified Index, Position, or Offset\n- CWE-1286: Syntactic Correctness\n- CWE-1287: Specified Type\n- CWE-1288: Consistency within Input\n- CWE-1289: Unsafe Equivalence\n- CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nCWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.\n\n\n**[Maintenance]** As of 2020, this entry is used more often than preferred, and it is a source of frequent confusion. It is being actively modified for CWE 4.1 and subsequent versions.\n\n**[Maintenance]** Concepts such as validation, data transformation, and neutralization are being refined, so relationships between CWE-20 and other entries such as CWE-707 may change in future versions, along with an update to the Vulnerability Theory document.\n\n**[Maintenance]** Input validation - whether missing or incorrect - is such an essential and widespread part of secure development that it is implicit in many different weaknesses. Traditionally, problems such as buffer overflows and XSS have been classified as input validation problems by many security professionals. However, input validation is not necessarily the only protection mechanism available for avoiding such problems, and in some cases it is not even sufficient. The CWE team has begun capturing these subtleties in chains within the Research Concepts view (CWE-1000), but more work is needed.\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nThe \"input validation\" term is extremely common, but it is used in many different ways. In some cases its usage can obscure the real underlying weakness or otherwise hide chaining and composite relationships.\n\n\nSome people use \"input validation\" as a general term that covers many different neutralization techniques for ensuring that input is appropriate, such as filtering, canonicalization, and escaping. Others use the term in a more narrow context to simply mean \"checking if an input conforms to expectations without changing it.\" CWE uses this more narrow interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n- **CVE-2021-30860:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) leads to integer overflow (CWE-190) in mobile OS, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nSpecified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-789\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

The product might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the product might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nPeerOf -> CWE-322\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).\n- **CVE-2021-22909:** Chain: router's firmware update procedure uses curl with \"-k\" (insecure) option that disables certificate validation (CWE-295), allowing adversary-in-the-middle (AITM) compromise with a malicious firmware image (CWE-494).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen the length value exceeds the size of the destination, a buffer overflow could occur.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-400\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nChildOf -> CWE-400\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).\n\n**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. \"Resource exhaustion\" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..\n- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-788\nChildOf -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
