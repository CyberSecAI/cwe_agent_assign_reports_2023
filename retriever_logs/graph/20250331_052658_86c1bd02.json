This occurs because of a **race condition** in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory object.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **race condition**\n- **weakness:** **use-after-free**\n- **product:** Linux kernel\n- **version:** through 5.15.11\n- **component:** drivers/tee/tee_shm.c\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44733:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is a race condition in the Linux kernel's TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) subsystem related to the lifetime management of shared memory (`tee_shm`) objects. The driver uses a combination of an IDR (ID Allocator) to track these objects and reference counting via the dma-buf subsystem, which proves insufficient to prevent use-after-free scenarios.\n\nSpecifically, the vulnerability stems from the following:\n\n1.  **Insufficient Reference Counting:** The TEE subsystem did not maintain a strong reference to its idle shared memory buffers. It relies on the dma-buf reference count, which is managed by user space file descriptor operations.\n2.  **Race Condition during Teardown:** When a shared memory dma-buf file descriptor is closed, the `tee_shm` object might be in the process of being deallocated. This teardown path can be blocked by the `teedev` mutex, but the reference to the `tee_shm` object in the IDR might still be valid for a brief period.\n3.  **Flawed Lookup Logic:** `tee_shm_get_from_id()` looks up a `tee_shm` object using the IDR and increments the dma-buf reference count *after* the lookup. This is problematic since the `tee_shm` object and its underlying memory might be in the process of being freed by another thread closing the dma-buf file descriptor. Thus, the lookup can return a pointer to a `tee_shm` that is in the process of deallocation.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free. A `tee_shm` object can be accessed after it has been freed by the dma-buf subsystem because the lookup function can return a pointer to an object in the process of deallocation.\n*   **Race Condition:** The vulnerability is triggered by a race condition between a thread closing a shared memory file descriptor and another thread trying to access the same shared memory.\n*   **Lack of Proper Synchronization:** The IDR and dma-buf reference counting mechanisms do not properly synchronize the lifecycle of `tee_shm` objects with their usage in the TEE subsystem. The mutex on `teedev->idr` is insufficient.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this UAF can cause the kernel to crash due to memory corruption.\n*   **Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit can overwrite a function pointer, which can lead to arbitrary code execution in kernel space, potentially leading to privilege escalation.\n*   **Memory Corruption:** The UAF leads to memory corruption when a freed object is accessed.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Local Access:** The attack vector requires local access to the system.\n*   **Multi-threaded Application:** The exploit requires a multi-threaded application that uses the TEE driver.\n*   **TEE Device Access:** The attacker must have permission to access a TEE device (typically `/dev/tee[0-9]`).\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system.\n*   **TEE Access:** The attacker must have the ability to open a TEE device and interact with the TEE driver.\n*   **Shared Memory Allocation:** The attacker should be able to allocate shared memory via the TEE driver.\n*   **Multi-threading:** The attacker needs to create a multi-threaded program to trigger the race condition. Specifically, one thread needs to be able to close the file descriptor associated with the shared memory while another thread attempts to open a session referencing the shared memory.\n*   **Precise Timing:** The attacker might require precise timing to reliably trigger the race condition and achieve the UAF and potentially do heap spraying to control the freed memory.\n\n**Additional Notes from the Analysis:**\n\n*   **Patching Strategy:** The fix for this vulnerability involves direct reference counting on the `tee_shm` struct itself, and it replaces the dma-buf usage with `anon_inode_getfd()`. This separates the lifecycle of the underlying file from the `tee_shm` object, preventing the race condition.\n*   **Exploitation Complexity:** While the vulnerability is present, exploitation is not trivial due to the race condition, time window, and need for heap manipulation and spraying to reallocate the freed object in controlled memory location and overwrite a function pointer.\n*   **PAN Mitigation:** The provided exploit requires `CONFIG_CPU_SW_DOMAIN_PAN` to be disabled because it needs to set a function pointer in kernel memory, but further research into bypassing PAN using ret2dir or physmap spraying is open.\n*   **Syzkaller Discovery:** The vulnerability was initially discovered using the syzkaller fuzzer.\n\nIn summary, CVE-2021-44733 is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel TEE subsystem that is caused by insufficient synchronization and reference counting, leading to a race condition that can be exploited by a local user.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') | Class | Allowed-with-Review | alternate_terms | 1.000 |\n| 2 | 416 | Use After Free | Variant | Allowed | alternate_terms | 1.000 |\n| 3 | 366 | Race Condition within a Thread | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.415 |\n| 4 | 367 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.294 |\n| 5 | 364 | Signal Handler Race Condition | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.293 |\n| 6 | 763 | Release of Invalid Pointer or Reference | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.534 |\n| 7 | 123 | Write-what-where Condition | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 415 | Double Free | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.292 |\n| 9 | 667 | Improper Locking | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.287 |\n| 10 | 911 | Improper Update of Reference Count | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.285 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nA race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.\n\n\nA race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:\n\n\n  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.\n\n  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.\n\nA race condition exists when an \"interfering code sequence\" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.\n\nThe interfering code sequence could be \"trusted\" or \"untrusted.\" A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nRace Condition\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-691\nCanPrecede -> CWE-416\nCanPrecede -> CWE-476\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed. They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.\n\n**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-416: Use After Free\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory \"belongs\" to the code that operates on the new pointer.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDangling pointer: a pointer that no longer points to valid memory, often after it has been freed\nUAF: commonly used acronym for Use After Free\nUse-After-Free\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-825\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nCanPrecede -> CWE-120\nCanPrecede -> CWE-123\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-20141:** Chain: an operating system kernel has insufficent resource locking (CWE-413) leading to a use after free (CWE-416).\n- **CVE-2022-2621:** Chain: two threads in a web browser use the same resource (CWE-366), but one of those threads can destroy the resource before the other has completed (CWE-416).\n- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-362\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nTOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to \"Time Of Check To Time Of Use\".\nTOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-362\nChildOf -> CWE-362\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** TOCTOU issues do not always involve symlinks, and not every symlink issue is a TOCTOU problem.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Non-symlink TOCTOU issues are not reported frequently, but they are likely to occur in code that attempts to be secure.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2015-1743:** TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed\n- **CVE-2003-0813:** A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.\n- **CVE-2004-0594:** PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nRace conditions frequently occur in signal handlers, since signal handlers support asynchronous actions. These race conditions have a variety of root causes and symptoms. Attackers may be able to exploit a signal handler race condition to cause the product state to be corrupted, possibly leading to a denial of service or even code execution.\n\n\nThese issues occur when non-reentrant functions, or state-sensitive actions occur in the signal handler, where they may be called at any time. These behaviors can violate assumptions being made by the \"regular\" code that is interrupted, or by other signal handlers that may also be invoked. If these functions are called at an inopportune moment - such as while a non-reentrant function is already running - memory corruption could occur that may be exploitable for code execution. Another signal race condition commonly found occurs when free is called within a signal handler, resulting in a double free and therefore a write-what-where condition. Even if a given pointer is set to NULL after it has been freed, a race condition still exists between the time the memory was freed and the pointer was set to NULL. This is especially problematic if the same signal handler has been set for more than one signal -- since it means that the signal handler itself may be reentered.\n\n\nThere are several known behaviors related to signal handlers that have received the label of \"signal handler race condition\":\n\n\n  - Shared state (e.g. global data or static variables) that are accessible to both a signal handler and \"regular\" code\n\n  - Shared state between a signal handler and other signal handlers\n\n  - Use of non-reentrant functionality within a signal handler - which generally implies that shared state is being used. For example, malloc() and free() are non-reentrant because they may use global or static data structures for managing memory, and they are indirectly used by innocent-seeming functions such as syslog(); these functions could be exploited for memory corruption and, possibly, code execution.\n\n  - Association of the same signal handler function with multiple signals - which might imply shared state, since the same code and resources are accessed. For example, this can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\n  - Use of setjmp and longjmp, or other mechanisms that prevent a signal handler from returning control back to the original functionality\n\n  - While not technically a race condition, some signal handlers are designed to be called at most once, and being called more than once can introduce security problems, even when there are not any concurrent calls to the signal handler. This can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\nSignal handler vulnerabilities are often classified based on the absence of a specific protection mechanism, although this style of classification is discouraged in CWE because programmers often have a choice of several different mechanisms for addressing the weakness. Such protection mechanisms may preserve exclusivity of access to the shared resource, and behavioral atomicity for the relevant code:\n\n  - Avoiding shared state\n\n  - Using synchronization in the signal handler\n\n  - Using synchronization in the regular code\n\n  - Disabling or masking other signals, which provides atomicity (which effectively ensures exclusivity)\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-362\nCanPrecede -> CWE-415\nCanPrecede -> CWE-416\nCanPrecede -> CWE-123\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Several entries will likely be created in this branch. Currently the focus is on free() of memory, but delete and other related release routines may require the creation of intermediate entries that are not specific to a particular function. In addition, the role of other types of invalid pointers, such as an expired pointer, i.e. CWE-415 Double Free and release of uninitialized pointers, related to CWE-457.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-11930:** function \"internally calls 'calloc' and returns a pointer at an index... inside the allocated buffer.

This corruption can cause the program to crash or, in some circumstances, cause two later calls to malloc() to return the same pointer. If malloc() returns the same value twice and the program later gives the attacker control over the data that is written into this doubly-allocated memory, the program becomes vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDouble-free\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-825\nChildOf -> CWE-1341\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-666\nPeerOf -> CWE-416\nPeerOf -> CWE-123\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

It could also be primary to weaknesses such as buffer overflows.\n\n**[Theoretical]** It could be argued that Double Free would be most appropriately located as a child of \"Use after Free\", but \"Use\" and \"Release\" are considered to be distinct operations within vulnerability theory, therefore this is more accurately \"Release of a Resource after Expiration or Release\", which doesn't exist yet.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2006-5051:** Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\n- **CVE-2004-0642:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n- **CVE-2004-0772:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nLocking is a type of synchronization behavior that ensures that multiple independently-operating processes or threads do not interfere with each other when accessing the same resource. All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process.

Multiple entries are dependent on this research, which includes relationships to concurrency, race conditions, reentrant functions, etc. CWE-662 and its children - including CWE-667, CWE-820, CWE-821, and others - may need to be modified significantly, along with their relationships.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2009-0935:** Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice\n- **CVE-2010-4210:** function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-911: Improper Update of Reference Count\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a reference count to manage a resource, but it does not update or incorrectly updates the reference count.\n\n### Extended Description\nReference counts can be used when tracking how many objects contain a reference to a particular resource, such as in memory management or garbage collection. When the reference count reaches zero, the resource can be de-allocated or reused because there are no more objects that use it. If the reference count accidentally reaches zero, then the resource might be released too soon, even though it is still in use. If all objects no longer use the resource, but the reference count is not zero, then the resource might not ever be released.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-664\nCanPrecede -> CWE-672\nCanPrecede -> CWE-772\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

The driver uses a combination of an IDR (ID Allocator) to track these objects and reference counting via the dma-buf subsystem, which proves insufficient to prevent use-after-free scenarios.\n\nSpecifically, the vulnerability stems from the following:\n\n1.  **Insufficient Reference Counting:** The TEE subsystem did not maintain a strong reference to its idle shared memory buffers. It relies on the dma-buf reference count, which is managed by user space file descriptor operations.\n2.  **Race Condition during Teardown:** When a shared memory dma-buf file descriptor is closed, the `tee_shm` object might be in the process of being deallocated. This teardown path can be blocked by the `teedev` mutex, but the reference to the `tee_shm` object in the IDR might still be valid for a brief period.\n3.  **Flawed Lookup Logic:** `tee_shm_get_from_id()` looks up a `tee_shm` object using the IDR and increments the dma-buf reference count *after* the lookup. This is problematic since the `tee_shm` object and its underlying memory might be in the process of being freed by another thread closing the dma-buf file descriptor. Thus, the lookup can return a pointer to a `tee_shm` that is in the process of deallocation.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free. A `tee_shm` object can be accessed after it has been freed by the dma-buf subsystem because the lookup function can return a pointer to an object in the process of deallocation.\n*   **Race Condition:** The vulnerability is triggered by a race condition between a thread closing a shared memory file descriptor and another thread trying to access the same shared memory.\n*   **Lack of Proper Synchronization:** The IDR and dma-buf reference counting mechanisms do not properly synchronize the lifecycle of `tee_shm` objects with their usage in the TEE subsystem. The mutex on `teedev->idr` is insufficient.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this UAF can cause the kernel to crash due to memory corruption.\n*   **Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit can overwrite a function pointer, which can lead to arbitrary code execution in kernel space, potentially leading to privilege escalation.\n*   **Memory Corruption:** The UAF leads to memory corruption when a freed object is accessed.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Local Access:** The attack vector requires local access to the system.\n*   **Multi-threaded Application:** The exploit requires a multi-threaded application that uses the TEE driver.\n*   **TEE Device Access:** The attacker must have permission to access a TEE device (typically `/dev/tee[0-9]`).\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system.\n*   **TEE Access:** The attacker must have the ability to open a TEE device and interact with the TEE driver.\n*   **Shared Memory Allocation:** The attacker should be able to allocate shared memory via the TEE driver.\n*   **Multi-threading:** The attacker needs to create a multi-threaded program to trigger the race condition. Specifically, one thread needs to be able to close the file descriptor associated with the shared memory while another thread attempts to open a session referencing the shared memory.\n*   **Precise Timing:** The attacker might require precise timing to reliably trigger the race condition and achieve the UAF and potentially do heap spraying to control the freed memory.\n\n**Additional Notes from the Analysis:**\n\n*   **Patching Strategy:** The fix for this vulnerability involves direct reference counting on the `tee_shm` struct itself, and it replaces the dma-buf usage with `anon_inode_getfd()`. This separates the lifecycle of the underlying file from the `tee_shm` object, preventing the race condition.\n*   **Exploitation Complexity:** While the vulnerability is present, exploitation is not trivial due to the race condition, time window, and need for heap manipulation and spraying to reallocate the freed object in controlled memory location and overwrite a function pointer.\n*   **PAN Mitigation:** The provided exploit requires `CONFIG_CPU_SW_DOMAIN_PAN` to be disabled because it needs to set a function pointer in kernel memory, but further research into bypassing PAN using ret2dir or physmap spraying is open.\n*   **Syzkaller Discovery:** The vulnerability was initially discovered using the syzkaller fuzzer.\n\nIn summary, CVE-2021-44733 is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel TEE subsystem that is caused by insufficient synchronization and reference counting, leading to a race condition that can be exploited by a local user.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') | Class | Allowed-with-Review | alternate_terms | 1.000 |\n| 2 | 416 | Use After Free | Variant | Allowed | alternate_terms | 1.000 |\n| 3 | 366 | Race Condition within a Thread | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.415 |\n| 4 | 367 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.294 |\n| 5 | 364 | Signal Handler Race Condition | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.293 |\n| 6 | 763 | Release of Invalid Pointer or Reference | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.534 |\n| 7 | 123 | Write-what-where Condition | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 415 | Double Free | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.292 |\n| 9 | 667 | Improper Locking | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.287 |\n| 10 | 911 | Improper Update of Reference Count | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.285 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nA race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.\n\n\nA race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:\n\n\n  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.\n\n  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.\n\nA race condition exists when an \"interfering code sequence\" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.\n\nThe interfering code sequence could be \"trusted\" or \"untrusted.\" A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nRace Condition\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-691\nCanPrecede -> CWE-416\nCanPrecede -> CWE-476\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed. They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.\n\n**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-416: Use After Free\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product reuses or references memory after it has been freed.

These race conditions have a variety of root causes and symptoms. Attackers may be able to exploit a signal handler race condition to cause the product state to be corrupted, possibly leading to a denial of service or even code execution.\n\n\nThese issues occur when non-reentrant functions, or state-sensitive actions occur in the signal handler, where they may be called at any time. These behaviors can violate assumptions being made by the \"regular\" code that is interrupted, or by other signal handlers that may also be invoked. If these functions are called at an inopportune moment - such as while a non-reentrant function is already running - memory corruption could occur that may be exploitable for code execution. Another signal race condition commonly found occurs when free is called within a signal handler, resulting in a double free and therefore a write-what-where condition. Even if a given pointer is set to NULL after it has been freed, a race condition still exists between the time the memory was freed and the pointer was set to NULL. This is especially problematic if the same signal handler has been set for more than one signal -- since it means that the signal handler itself may be reentered.\n\n\nThere are several known behaviors related to signal handlers that have received the label of \"signal handler race condition\":\n\n\n  - Shared state (e.g. global data or static variables) that are accessible to both a signal handler and \"regular\" code\n\n  - Shared state between a signal handler and other signal handlers\n\n  - Use of non-reentrant functionality within a signal handler - which generally implies that shared state is being used. For example, malloc() and free() are non-reentrant because they may use global or static data structures for managing memory, and they are indirectly used by innocent-seeming functions such as syslog(); these functions could be exploited for memory corruption and, possibly, code execution.\n\n  - Association of the same signal handler function with multiple signals - which might imply shared state, since the same code and resources are accessed. For example, this can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\n  - Use of setjmp and longjmp, or other mechanisms that prevent a signal handler from returning control back to the original functionality\n\n  - While not technically a race condition, some signal handlers are designed to be called at most once, and being called more than once can introduce security problems, even when there are not any concurrent calls to the signal handler. This can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\nSignal handler vulnerabilities are often classified based on the absence of a specific protection mechanism, although this style of classification is discouraged in CWE because programmers often have a choice of several different mechanisms for addressing the weakness. Such protection mechanisms may preserve exclusivity of access to the shared resource, and behavioral atomicity for the relevant code:\n\n  - Avoiding shared state\n\n  - Using synchronization in the signal handler\n\n  - Using synchronization in the regular code\n\n  - Disabling or masking other signals, which provides atomicity (which effectively ensures exclusivity)\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-362\nCanPrecede -> CWE-415\nCanPrecede -> CWE-416\nCanPrecede -> CWE-123\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This corruption can cause the program to crash or, in some circumstances, cause two later calls to malloc() to return the same pointer.

It could also be primary to weaknesses such as buffer overflows.\n\n**[Theoretical]** It could be argued that Double Free would be most appropriately located as a child of \"Use after Free\", but \"Use\" and \"Release\" are considered to be distinct operations within vulnerability theory, therefore this is more accurately \"Release of a Resource after Expiration or Release\", which doesn't exist yet.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2006-5051:** Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\n- **CVE-2004-0642:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n- **CVE-2004-0772:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nLocking is a type of synchronization behavior that ensures that multiple independently-operating processes or threads do not interfere with each other when accessing the same resource. All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process.

When the reference count reaches zero, the resource can be de-allocated or reused because there are no more objects that use it. If the reference count accidentally reaches zero, then the resource might be released too soon, even though it is still in use. If all objects no longer use the resource, but the reference count is not zero, then the resource might not ever be released.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-664\nCanPrecede -> CWE-672\nCanPrecede -> CWE-772\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

    "enhanced_query": "## Vulnerability Description\nA **use-after-free** exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11. This occurs because of a **race condition** in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory object.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **race condition**\n- **weakness:** **use-after-free**\n- **product:** Linux kernel\n- **version:** through 5.15.11\n- **component:** drivers/tee/tee_shm.c\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44733:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is a race condition in the Linux kernel's TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) subsystem related to the lifetime management of shared memory (`tee_shm`) objects. The driver uses a combination of an IDR (ID Allocator) to track these objects and reference counting via the dma-buf subsystem, which proves insufficient to prevent use-after-free scenarios.\n\nSpecifically, the vulnerability stems from the following:\n\n1.  **Insufficient Reference Counting:** The TEE subsystem did not maintain a strong reference to its idle shared memory buffers. It relies on the dma-buf reference count, which is managed by user space file descriptor operations.\n2.  **Race Condition during Teardown:** When a shared memory dma-buf file descriptor is closed, the `tee_shm` object might be in the process of being deallocated. This teardown path can be blocked by the `teedev` mutex, but the reference to the `tee_shm` object in the IDR might still be valid for a brief period.\n3.  **Flawed Lookup Logic:** `tee_shm_get_from_id()` looks up a `tee_shm` object using the IDR and increments the dma-buf reference count *after* the lookup. This is problematic since the `tee_shm` object and its underlying memory might be in the process of being freed by another thread closing the dma-buf file descriptor. Thus, the lookup can return a pointer to a `tee_shm` that is in the process of deallocation.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free. A `tee_shm` object can be accessed after it has been freed by the dma-buf subsystem because the lookup function can return a pointer to an object in the process of deallocation.\n*   **Race Condition:** The vulnerability is triggered by a race condition between a thread closing a shared memory file descriptor and another thread trying to access the same shared memory.\n*   **Lack of Proper Synchronization:** The IDR and dma-buf reference counting mechanisms do not properly synchronize the lifecycle of `tee_shm` objects with their usage in the TEE subsystem. The mutex on `teedev->idr` is insufficient.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this UAF can cause the kernel to crash due to memory corruption.\n*   **Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit can overwrite a function pointer, which can lead to arbitrary code execution in kernel space, potentially leading to privilege escalation.\n*   **Memory Corruption:** The UAF leads to memory corruption when a freed object is accessed.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Local Access:** The attack vector requires local access to the system.\n*   **Multi-threaded Application:** The exploit requires a multi-threaded application that uses the TEE driver.\n*   **TEE Device Access:** The attacker must have permission to access a TEE device (typically `/dev/tee[0-9]`).\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system.\n*   **TEE Access:** The attacker must have the ability to open a TEE device and interact with the TEE driver.\n*   **Shared Memory Allocation:** The attacker should be able to allocate shared memory via the TEE driver.\n*   **Multi-threading:** The attacker needs to create a multi-threaded program to trigger the race condition. Specifically, one thread needs to be able to close the file descriptor associated with the shared memory while another thread attempts to open a session referencing the shared memory.\n*   **Precise Timing:** The attacker might require precise timing to reliably trigger the race condition and achieve the UAF and potentially do heap spraying to control the freed memory.\n\n**Additional Notes from the Analysis:**\n\n*   **Patching Strategy:** The fix for this vulnerability involves direct reference counting on the `tee_shm` struct itself, and it replaces the dma-buf usage with `anon_inode_getfd()`. This separates the lifecycle of the underlying file from the `tee_shm` object, preventing the race condition.\n*   **Exploitation Complexity:** While the vulnerability is present, exploitation is not trivial due to the race condition, time window, and need for heap manipulation and spraying to reallocate the freed object in controlled memory location and overwrite a function pointer.\n*   **PAN Mitigation:** The provided exploit requires `CONFIG_CPU_SW_DOMAIN_PAN` to be disabled because it needs to set a function pointer in kernel memory, but further research into bypassing PAN using ret2dir or physmap spraying is open.\n*   **Syzkaller Discovery:** The vulnerability was initially discovered using the syzkaller fuzzer.\n\nIn summary, CVE-2021-44733 is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel TEE subsystem that is caused by insufficient synchronization and reference counting, leading to a race condition that can be exploited by a local user.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') | Class | Allowed-with-Review | alternate_terms | 1.000 |\n| 2 | 416 | Use After Free | Variant | Allowed | alternate_terms | 1.000 |\n| 3 | 366 | Race Condition within a Thread | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.415 |\n| 4 | 367 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.294 |\n| 5 | 364 | Signal Handler Race Condition | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.293 |\n| 6 | 763 | Release of Invalid Pointer or Reference | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.534 |\n| 7 | 123 | Write-what-where Condition | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 415 | Double Free | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.292 |\n| 9 | 667 | Improper Locking | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.287 |\n| 10 | 911 | Improper Update of Reference Count | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.285 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nA race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.\n\n\nA race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:\n\n\n  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.\n\n  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.\n\nA race condition exists when an \"interfering code sequence\" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.\n\nThe interfering code sequence could be \"trusted\" or \"untrusted.\" A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nRace Condition\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-691\nCanPrecede -> CWE-416\nCanPrecede -> CWE-476\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed. They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.\n\n**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-416: Use After Free\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation.

This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nTOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to \"Time Of Check To Time Of Use\".\nTOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-362\nChildOf -> CWE-362\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** TOCTOU issues do not always involve symlinks, and not every symlink issue is a TOCTOU problem.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Non-symlink TOCTOU issues are not reported frequently, but they are likely to occur in code that attempts to be secure.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2015-1743:** TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed\n- **CVE-2003-0813:** A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.\n- **CVE-2004-0594:** PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nRace conditions frequently occur in signal handlers, since signal handlers support asynchronous actions. These race conditions have a variety of root causes and symptoms. Attackers may be able to exploit a signal handler race condition to cause the product state to be corrupted, possibly leading to a denial of service or even code execution.\n\n\nThese issues occur when non-reentrant functions, or state-sensitive actions occur in the signal handler, where they may be called at any time. These behaviors can violate assumptions being made by the \"regular\" code that is interrupted, or by other signal handlers that may also be invoked. If these functions are called at an inopportune moment - such as while a non-reentrant function is already running - memory corruption could occur that may be exploitable for code execution. Another signal race condition commonly found occurs when free is called within a signal handler, resulting in a double free and therefore a write-what-where condition. Even if a given pointer is set to NULL after it has been freed, a race condition still exists between the time the memory was freed and the pointer was set to NULL. This is especially problematic if the same signal handler has been set for more than one signal -- since it means that the signal handler itself may be reentered.\n\n\nThere are several known behaviors related to signal handlers that have received the label of \"signal handler race condition\":\n\n\n  - Shared state (e.g. global data or static variables) that are accessible to both a signal handler and \"regular\" code\n\n  - Shared state between a signal handler and other signal handlers\n\n  - Use of non-reentrant functionality within a signal handler - which generally implies that shared state is being used. For example, malloc() and free() are non-reentrant because they may use global or static data structures for managing memory, and they are indirectly used by innocent-seeming functions such as syslog(); these functions could be exploited for memory corruption and, possibly, code execution.\n\n  - Association of the same signal handler function with multiple signals - which might imply shared state, since the same code and resources are accessed. For example, this can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\n  - Use of setjmp and longjmp, or other mechanisms that prevent a signal handler from returning control back to the original functionality\n\n  - While not technically a race condition, some signal handlers are designed to be called at most once, and being called more than once can introduce security problems, even when there are not any concurrent calls to the signal handler. This can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\nSignal handler vulnerabilities are often classified based on the absence of a specific protection mechanism, although this style of classification is discouraged in CWE because programmers often have a choice of several different mechanisms for addressing the weakness. Such protection mechanisms may preserve exclusivity of access to the shared resource, and behavioral atomicity for the relevant code:\n\n  - Avoiding shared state\n\n  - Using synchronization in the signal handler\n\n  - Using synchronization in the regular code\n\n  - Disabling or masking other signals, which provides atomicity (which effectively ensures exclusivity)\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-362\nCanPrecede -> CWE-415\nCanPrecede -> CWE-416\nCanPrecede -> CWE-123\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Several entries will likely be created in this branch. Currently the focus is on free() of memory, but delete and other related release routines may require the creation of intermediate entries that are not specific to a particular function. In addition, the role of other types of invalid pointers, such as an expired pointer, i.e. CWE-415 Double Free and release of uninitialized pointers, related to CWE-457.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-11930:** function \"internally calls 'calloc' and returns a pointer at an index... inside the allocated buffer. This led to freeing invalid memory.\"\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nAny condition where the attacker has the ability to write an arbitrary value to an arbitrary location, often as the result of a buffer overflow.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-787\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This corruption can cause the program to crash or, in some circumstances, cause two later calls to malloc() to return the same pointer. If malloc() returns the same value twice and the program later gives the attacker control over the data that is written into this doubly-allocated memory, the program becomes vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDouble-free\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-825\nChildOf -> CWE-1341\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-666\nPeerOf -> CWE-416\nPeerOf -> CWE-123\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

It could also be primary to weaknesses such as buffer overflows.\n\n**[Theoretical]** It could be argued that Double Free would be most appropriately located as a child of \"Use after Free\", but \"Use\" and \"Release\" are considered to be distinct operations within vulnerability theory, therefore this is more accurately \"Release of a Resource after Expiration or Release\", which doesn't exist yet.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2006-5051:** Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\n- **CVE-2004-0642:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n- **CVE-2004-0772:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nLocking is a type of synchronization behavior that ensures that multiple independently-operating processes or threads do not interfere with each other when accessing the same resource. All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms. Multiple entries are dependent on this research, which includes relationships to concurrency, race conditions, reentrant functions, etc. CWE-662 and its children - including CWE-667, CWE-820, CWE-821, and others - may need to be modified significantly, along with their relationships.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2009-0935:** Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice\n- **CVE-2010-4210:** function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-911: Improper Update of Reference Count\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a reference count to manage a resource, but it does not update or incorrectly updates the reference count.\n\n### Extended Description\nReference counts can be used when tracking how many objects contain a reference to a particular resource, such as in memory management or garbage collection. When the reference count reaches zero, the resource can be de-allocated or reused because there are no more objects that use it. If the reference count accidentally reaches zero, then the resource might be released too soon, even though it is still in use. If all objects no longer use the resource, but the reference count is not zero, then the resource might not ever be released.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-664\nCanPrecede -> CWE-672\nCanPrecede -> CWE-772\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
