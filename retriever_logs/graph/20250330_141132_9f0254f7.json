These credentials are stored in the per-user credentials store, and the plugin allows pipelines to access them.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Insecure Credential Access:** The Blue Ocean Credentials Provider allows pipelines to access credentials stored in a per-user credential store.\n*   **Authorization Bypass:** Attackers with `Job/Configure` permission can rewrite job configurations to access attacker-specified credentials from any user's private credential store.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Credential Exposure:** Attackers can access and capture sensitive credentials from other users' private credential stores. This can lead to further unauthorized access to systems and resources protected by the captured credentials.\n*   **Loss of Confidentiality:** Sensitive information contained within the captured credentials can be exposed.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Job Configuration Manipulation:** Attackers must have the ability to configure Jenkins jobs. This can be achieved through having the 'Job/Configure' permission.\n*   **Rewriting Job Configurations:** Attackers need to rewrite job configurations in a way to use the Blue Ocean Credentials Provider and request an arbitrary credential.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Job/Configure Permission:** An attacker must possess `Job/Configure` permission for a Jenkins job.\n*   **Knowledge of Credential Store Location:** While not stated directly, the attacker would need knowledge of the credential store's location within the Blue Ocean plugin.\n*  **Ability to Rewrite Job Configurations:** The attacker needs to have the ability to modify existing job configurations to inject the malicious credential retrieval code.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The advisory mentions that the vulnerability was fixed in Pipeline SCM API for Blue Ocean Plugin 1.25.4 by deprecating the Blue Ocean Credentials Provider and disabling it by default.\n*   Administrators are advised to reconfigure affected pipelines to use credentials from the Jenkins credential store or a folder credential store.\n*  It is possible to re-enable the unsafe functionality via a system property, which is highly discouraged.\n* The vulnerability is specific to pipelines created using the pipeline creation wizard in Blue Ocean.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.341 |\n| 2 | 862 | Missing Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.330 |\n| 3 | 256 | Plaintext Storage of a Password | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.310 |\n| 4 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.262 |\n| 5 | 260 | Password in Configuration File | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.257 |\n| 6 | 9 | J2EE Misconfiguration: Weak Access Permissions for EJB Methods | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.448 |\n| 7 | 804 | Guessable CAPTCHA | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.001 |\n| 8 | 838 | Inappropriate Encoding for Output Context | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.249 |\n| 9 | 538 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.248 |\n| 10 | 549 | Missing Password Field Masking | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.231 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30018:** A messaging platform serializes all elements of User/Group objects, making private information available to adversaries\n- **CVE-2022-29959:** Initialization file contains credentials that can be decoded using a \"simple string transformation\"\n- **CVE-2022-35411:** Python-based RPC framework enables pickle functionality by default, allowing clients to unpickle untrusted data.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community.

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-4036:** Chain: appointment booking app uses a weak hash (CWE-328) for generating a CAPTCHA, making it guessable (CWE-804)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-838: Inappropriate Encoding for Output Context\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses or specifies an encoding when generating output to a downstream component, but the specified encoding is not the same as the encoding that is expected by the downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis weakness can cause the downstream component to use a decoding method that produces different data than what the product intended to send. When the wrong encoding is used - even if closely related - the downstream component could decode the data incorrectly. This can have security consequences when the provided boundaries between control and data are inadvertently broken, because the resulting data could introduce control characters or special elements that were not sent by the product. The resulting data could then be used to bypass protection mechanisms such as input validation, and enable injection attacks.\n\n\nWhile using output encoding is essential for ensuring that communications between components are accurate, the use of the wrong encoding - even if closely related - could cause the downstream component to misinterpret the output.\n\n\nFor example, HTML entity encoding is used for elements in the HTML body of a web page. However, a programmer might use entity encoding when generating output for that is used within an attribute of an HTML tag, which could contain functional Javascript that is not affected by the HTML encoding.\n\n\nWhile web applications have received the most attention for this problem, this weakness could potentially apply to any type of product that uses a communications stream that could support multiple encodings.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-116\nChildOf -> CWE-116\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2009-2814:** Server does not properly handle requests that do not contain UTF-8 data; browser assumes UTF-8, allowing XSS.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** Depending on usage, this could be a weakness or a category. Further study of all its children is needed, and the entire sub-tree may need to be clarified. The current organization is based primarily on the exposure of sensitive information as a consequence, instead of as a primary weakness.\n\n**[Maintenance]** There is a close relationship with CWE-552, which is more focused on weaknesses. As a result, it may be more appropriate to convert CWE-538 to a category.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2018-1999036:** SSH password for private key stored in build log\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-549: Missing Password Field Masking\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not mask passwords during entry, increasing the potential for attackers to observe and capture passwords.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-522\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

These credentials are stored in the per-user credentials store, and the plugin allows pipelines to access them.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Insecure Credential Access:** The Blue Ocean Credentials Provider allows pipelines to access credentials stored in a per-user credential store.\n*   **Authorization Bypass:** Attackers with `Job/Configure` permission can rewrite job configurations to access attacker-specified credentials from any user's private credential store.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Credential Exposure:** Attackers can access and capture sensitive credentials from other users' private credential stores. This can lead to further unauthorized access to systems and resources protected by the captured credentials.\n*   **Loss of Confidentiality:** Sensitive information contained within the captured credentials can be exposed.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Job Configuration Manipulation:** Attackers must have the ability to configure Jenkins jobs. This can be achieved through having the 'Job/Configure' permission.\n*   **Rewriting Job Configurations:** Attackers need to rewrite job configurations in a way to use the Blue Ocean Credentials Provider and request an arbitrary credential.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Job/Configure Permission:** An attacker must possess `Job/Configure` permission for a Jenkins job.\n*   **Knowledge of Credential Store Location:** While not stated directly, the attacker would need knowledge of the credential store's location within the Blue Ocean plugin.\n*  **Ability to Rewrite Job Configurations:** The attacker needs to have the ability to modify existing job configurations to inject the malicious credential retrieval code.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The advisory mentions that the vulnerability was fixed in Pipeline SCM API for Blue Ocean Plugin 1.25.4 by deprecating the Blue Ocean Credentials Provider and disabling it by default.\n*   Administrators are advised to reconfigure affected pipelines to use credentials from the Jenkins credential store or a folder credential store.\n*  It is possible to re-enable the unsafe functionality via a system property, which is highly discouraged.\n* The vulnerability is specific to pipelines created using the pipeline creation wizard in Blue Ocean.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.341 |\n| 2 | 862 | Missing Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.330 |\n| 3 | 256 | Plaintext Storage of a Password | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.310 |\n| 4 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.262 |\n| 5 | 260 | Password in Configuration File | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.257 |\n| 6 | 9 | J2EE Misconfiguration: Weak Access Permissions for EJB Methods | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.448 |\n| 7 | 804 | Guessable CAPTCHA | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.001 |\n| 8 | 838 | Inappropriate Encoding for Output Context | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.249 |\n| 9 | 538 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.248 |\n| 10 | 549 | Missing Password Field Masking | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.231 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30018:** A messaging platform serializes all elements of User/Group objects, making private information available to adversaries\n- **CVE-2022-29959:** Initialization file contains credentials that can be decoded using a \"simple string transformation\"\n- **CVE-2022-35411:** Python-based RPC framework enables pickle functionality by default, allowing clients to unpickle untrusted data.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community.
