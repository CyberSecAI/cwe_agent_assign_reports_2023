A specially-crafted gerber file can lead to code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **out-of-bounds write**\n- **impact:** code execution\n- **vector:** specially-crafted gerber file\n- **attacker:** attacker\n- **product:** Gerbv\n- **version:** 2.7.0 and dev (commit b5f1eacd), forked version (commit 71493260)\n- **component:** RS-274X aperture macro variables handling functionality\n\n### CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\n### Primary CWE Match\nCWE-787\n\n#### Top CWEs\n- CWE-787 (Count: 16)\n- CWE-755 (Count: 4)\n- CWE-125 (Count: 2)\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-40393:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n*   The vulnerability lies in the way `gerbv` handles RS-274X format aperture macro variables, specifically during the parsing and execution of aperture macro templates.\n*   The `simplify_aperture_macro` function lacks proper bounds checking when accessing and modifying an array of parameters used in the aperture macro execution. This leads to an out-of-bounds write.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The core vulnerability is the ability to write data outside of the allocated memory buffer for storing aperture macro parameters.\n*   **Missing Bounds Checks:**  The code does not validate if the variable number (used as an index in the parameter array `lp`) is within the valid range.\n*   **Lax Parsing of Template Macros:** The parser allows for assignment to arbitrary variables, including negative indices which are then used to write out of bounds.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By writing to out-of-bounds memory, an attacker can overwrite critical data or program instructions, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. This is further facilitated by the fact that the values written in memory are directly controlled by the attacker.\n*   **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability can cause the program to crash, leading to a denial of service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Malicious Gerber File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted Gerber file containing a malicious aperture macro definition and instantiation.\n*   **File Processing:**  The attacker supplies the malicious file to `gerbv`, which then parses and executes the vulnerable macro, triggering the out-of-bounds write.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Ability to provide input to gerbv:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious Gerber file to `gerbv` for processing. This may involve uploading a crafted file to a service using gerbv for rendering.\n*   **No user interaction or privileges:** The Talos report notes that the software is often used in automated workflows, making it reachable via the network without user interaction or specific privileges.\n\n**Additional Details from the Content:**\n\n*   **Vulnerable Functions:** The key functions involved are `gerbv_open_image`, `gerber_is_rs274x_p`, `parse_gerb`, `gerber_parse_file_segment`, `parse_rs274x`, `parse_aperture_macro`, `parse_aperture_definition`, and `simplify_aperture_macro`.\n*   **Virtual Machine:**  `parse_aperture_macro` effectively constructs a virtual machine to interpret aperture macro templates, using a virtual stack and a parameter array. This is how the out-of-bounds access is enabled.\n*   **Example Exploit:** The provided example shows how a negative variable name in an `AM` command can cause an out-of-bounds write when processing the associated `AD` command.\n*   **Affected Versions:** gerbv versions 2.7.0 and dev (commit b5f1eacd) and forked version of gerbv (commit 71493260) are vulnerable.\n*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSSv3 score of 10.0, indicating a critical severity.\n\nThe provided information gives more detailed technical insights compared to a standard CVE description, including a code-level explanation of the vulnerability and how it can be triggered.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 252 | Unchecked Return Value | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.424 |\n| 2 | 787 | Out-of-bounds Write | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.403 |\n| 3 | 129 | Improper Validation of Array Index | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.375 |\n| 4 | 125 | Out-of-bounds Read | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.374 |\n| 5 | 909 | Missing Initialization of Resource | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.366 |\n| 6 | 126 | Buffer Over-read | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.591 |\n| 7 | 456 | Missing Initialization of a Variable | Variant | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.363 |\n| 9 | 122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.359 |\n| 10 | 1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.348 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.\n\n### Extended Description\nTwo common programmer assumptions are \"this function call can never fail\" and \"it doesn't matter if this function call fails\". If an attacker can force the function to fail or otherwise return a value that is not expected, then the subsequent program logic could lead to a vulnerability, because the product is not in a state that the programmer assumes. For example, if the program calls a function to drop privileges but does not check the return code to ensure that privileges were successfully dropped, then the program will continue to operate with the higher privileges.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-754\nChildOf -> CWE-754\nCanPrecede -> CWE-476\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may\n         become a very small or negative number.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOverflow: The terms \"overflow\" and \"wraparound\" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.\nWraparound: The terms \"overflow\" and \"wraparound\" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.\nwrap, wrap-around, wrap around: Alternate spellings of \"wraparound\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with \"overflow,\" \"underflow,\" and \"wraparound\" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called \"underflows\").\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\n\"Integer overflow\" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.\n\n\nA \"wraparound\" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.\n\n\n\"Overflow\" is sometimes conflated with \"wraparound\" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.\n\n\nThe \"overflow\" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use \"overflow\" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using \"underflow\" for exceeding the minimum.\n\n\nSome people use \"overflow\" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses \"underflow\" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.\n\n\nSee [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.\n\n\n**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-788\nChildOf -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called \"underflows\").\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\n\"Integer overflow\" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.\n\n\nA \"wraparound\" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.\n\n\n\"Overflow\" is sometimes conflated with \"wraparound\" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.\n\n\nThe \"overflow\" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use \"overflow\" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using \"underflow\" for exceeding the minimum.\n\n\nSome people use \"overflow\" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses \"underflow\" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.\n\n\nSee [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.\n\n\n**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190).

A specially-crafted gerber file can lead to code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **out-of-bounds write**\n- **impact:** code execution\n- **vector:** specially-crafted gerber file\n- **attacker:** attacker\n- **product:** Gerbv\n- **version:** 2.7.0 and dev (commit b5f1eacd), forked version (commit 71493260)\n- **component:** RS-274X aperture macro variables handling functionality\n\n### CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\n### Primary CWE Match\nCWE-787\n\n#### Top CWEs\n- CWE-787 (Count: 16)\n- CWE-755 (Count: 4)\n- CWE-125 (Count: 2)\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-40393:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n*   The vulnerability lies in the way `gerbv` handles RS-274X format aperture macro variables, specifically during the parsing and execution of aperture macro templates.\n*   The `simplify_aperture_macro` function lacks proper bounds checking when accessing and modifying an array of parameters used in the aperture macro execution. This leads to an out-of-bounds write.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The core vulnerability is the ability to write data outside of the allocated memory buffer for storing aperture macro parameters.\n*   **Missing Bounds Checks:**  The code does not validate if the variable number (used as an index in the parameter array `lp`) is within the valid range.\n*   **Lax Parsing of Template Macros:** The parser allows for assignment to arbitrary variables, including negative indices which are then used to write out of bounds.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By writing to out-of-bounds memory, an attacker can overwrite critical data or program instructions, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. This is further facilitated by the fact that the values written in memory are directly controlled by the attacker.\n*   **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability can cause the program to crash, leading to a denial of service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Malicious Gerber File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted Gerber file containing a malicious aperture macro definition and instantiation.\n*   **File Processing:**  The attacker supplies the malicious file to `gerbv`, which then parses and executes the vulnerable macro, triggering the out-of-bounds write.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Ability to provide input to gerbv:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious Gerber file to `gerbv` for processing. This may involve uploading a crafted file to a service using gerbv for rendering.\n*   **No user interaction or privileges:** The Talos report notes that the software is often used in automated workflows, making it reachable via the network without user interaction or specific privileges.\n\n**Additional Details from the Content:**\n\n*   **Vulnerable Functions:** The key functions involved are `gerbv_open_image`, `gerber_is_rs274x_p`, `parse_gerb`, `gerber_parse_file_segment`, `parse_rs274x`, `parse_aperture_macro`, `parse_aperture_definition`, and `simplify_aperture_macro`.\n*   **Virtual Machine:**  `parse_aperture_macro` effectively constructs a virtual machine to interpret aperture macro templates, using a virtual stack and a parameter array. This is how the out-of-bounds access is enabled.\n*   **Example Exploit:** The provided example shows how a negative variable name in an `AM` command can cause an out-of-bounds write when processing the associated `AD` command.\n*   **Affected Versions:** gerbv versions 2.7.0 and dev (commit b5f1eacd) and forked version of gerbv (commit 71493260) are vulnerable.\n*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSSv3 score of 10.0, indicating a critical severity.\n\nThe provided information gives more detailed technical insights compared to a standard CVE description, including a code-level explanation of the vulnerability and how it can be triggered.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 252 | Unchecked Return Value | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.424 |\n| 2 | 787 | Out-of-bounds Write | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.403 |\n| 3 | 129 | Improper Validation of Array Index | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.375 |\n| 4 | 125 | Out-of-bounds Read | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.374 |\n| 5 | 909 | Missing Initialization of Resource | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.366 |\n| 6 | 126 | Buffer Over-read | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.591 |\n| 7 | 456 | Missing Initialization of a Variable | Variant | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.363 |\n| 9 | 122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.359 |\n| 10 | 1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.348 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.\n\n### Extended Description\nTwo common programmer assumptions are \"this function call can never fail\" and \"it doesn't matter if this function call fails\".

This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may\n         become a very small or negative number.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOverflow: The terms \"overflow\" and \"wraparound\" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.\nWraparound: The terms \"overflow\" and \"wraparound\" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.\nwrap, wrap-around, wrap around: Alternate spellings of \"wraparound\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with \"overflow,\" \"underflow,\" and \"wraparound\" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called \"underflows\").\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\n\"Integer overflow\" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.\n\n\nA \"wraparound\" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.\n\n\n\"Overflow\" is sometimes conflated with \"wraparound\" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.\n\n\nThe \"overflow\" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use \"overflow\" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using \"underflow\" for exceeding the minimum.\n\n\nSome people use \"overflow\" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses \"underflow\" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.\n\n\nSee [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.\n\n\n**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-788\nChildOf -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
