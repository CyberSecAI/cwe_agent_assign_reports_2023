This flaw affects Blender versions prior to 2.83.19, 2.93.8 and 3.1.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'integer overflow'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
