Certifi 2022.12.07 removes root certificates from TrustCor from the root store. These are in the process of being removed from Mozillas trust store. TrustCors root certificates are being removed pursuant to an investigation prompted by media reporting that TrustCors ownership also operated a business that produced spyware. Conclusions of Mozillas investigation can be found in the linked google group discussion.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **product:** Certifi\n- **version:** 2022.12.07\n- **component:** root store\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2022-23491 vulnerability:\n\n**1. Relevance to CVE-2022-23491:**\n   - The provided content directly relates to CVE-2022-23491. It describes the vulnerability as the removal of TrustCor root certificates from the certifi package due to concerns about TrustCor's ownership and potential links to spyware development. The NetApp advisory also explicitly mentions CVE-2022-23491 and its impact on their products.\n\n**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n   - The vulnerability isn't due to a flaw in the certifi package itself, but rather the inclusion of TrustCor root certificates, which were later deemed untrustworthy due to their connections to a spyware company. The removal of these certificates addresses the trust issue.\n   - The root cause can be seen as a supply chain issue, where the certifi package bundled a certificate that became a source of concern.\n\n**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n   - **Compromised Trust:** The primary weakness is that the trust placed in the TrustCor root certificates was compromised, as they were linked to a company that produced spyware. This made certificates issued by TrustCor potentially dangerous to use.\n   - **Potential for Data Modification:** The NetApp advisory highlights that successful exploitation \"could lead to addition or modification of data.\" However, this statement is not explained further, and the root of such a vulnerability (which is likely separate from the certificate removal) is not provided. This seems more related to the potential for a MitM-attack, and not the certificate itself.\n   - **Supply Chain Risk:** There's also the broader weakness of supply chain risk, where a commonly used package included a component that was later found to be problematic.\n\n**4. Impact of Exploitation:**\n   - The impact of exploitation, according to the NetApp advisory, is that \"successful exploitation... could lead to addition or modification of data.\"\n   - The main concern was the possibility of a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack if TrustCor were compromised, or acted maliciously. This is because the trust relationship is exploited for malicious purposes, for example to intercept and modify encrypted traffic or other communications, or, in the worst case to issue certificates to malicious entities, causing trust to be wrongly placed in those entities.\n   - This impact was mitigated by distrusting TrustCor's root certificates and thereby removing them from trust chains.\n   - Additionally, there is a risk of disruption of services that rely on those certificates, if not replaced prior to distrust.\n\n**5. Attack Vectors:**\n   - The main attack vector is through man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. If a malicious actor controls or subverts a certificate authority (like TrustCor in this case) they can forge a trusted certificate, and then use this certificate to intercept data passing along a connection.\n\n**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n    - An attacker would have to be in a position to perform a MitM attack. This could mean being on the same network as the victim, or having gained access to a compromised router or other network hardware/infrastructure, or having compromised a DNS server.\n    - The attacker would also have to have gained the ability to issue valid (but potentially malicious) certificates by controlling the compromised root certificate authority, or be able to forge trusted signatures for TLS.\n    - The attacker would need to have control over the certificate authority.\n    - In short, an attacker would need a very high level of sophistication to exploit the vulnerabilities discovered in TrustCor, which is why this problem had to be solved by a policy-level change of distrusting the authority.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The content provides extensive background about the issues leading to the distrust of TrustCor, including its connections to a spyware company (Measurement Systems), the discovery of a spyware SDK in the MsgSafe app, and issues surrounding corporate ownership. The group discussion provides greater details on how various stakeholders within the CA/Browser forum view the company and their behavior.\n- The Mozilla Security team's actions and the subsequent distrust of TrustCor by Google are significant actions, reflecting the seriousness of the situation.\n- The content provides further details of the concerns and the responses from TrustCor beyond that of the CVE description.\n- The conversation also reveals a potential weakness in the supply chain security in the context of commonly used libraries and certificate authorities.\n- The discussion details the complex and multilayered issues surrounding TrustCor's legitimacy as a trusted root certificate authority.\n\nIn summary, CVE-2022-23491 stems from the discovery of an untrustworthy certificate authority, TrustCor, and its connections to a spyware company, necessitating its removal from trusted root stores. The primary vulnerability was the compromised trust, which could have resulted in MitM attacks and other forms of data modification, but was addressed via distrust of TrustCor root certificates.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 345 | Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.253 |\n| 2 | 295 | Improper Certificate Validation | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.155 |\n| 3 | 296 | Improper Following of a Certificate's Chain of Trust | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.141 |\n| 4 | 459 | Incomplete Cleanup | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.128 |\n| 5 | 1240 | Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.126 |\n| 6 | 297 | Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.376 |\n| 7 | 370 | Missing Check for Certificate Revocation after Initial Check | Variant | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 259 | Use of Hard-coded Password | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.126 |\n| 9 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.124 |\n| 10 | 367 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.123 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-693\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

In some sense, this is more like a category.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30260:** Distributed Control System (DCS) does not sign firmware images and only relies on insecure checksums for integrity checks\n- **CVE-2022-30267:** Distributed Control System (DCS) does not sign firmware images and only relies on insecure checksums for integrity checks\n- **CVE-2022-30272:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) does not use signatures for firmware images and relies on insecure checksums\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by interfering in the communication path between the host and client.

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-12496:** A Go framework for robotics, drones, and IoT devices skips verification of root CA certificates by default.\n- **CVE-2014-1266:** chain: incorrect \"goto\" in Apple SSL product bypasses certificate validation, allowing Adversary-in-the-Middle (AITM) attack (Apple \"goto fail\" bug). CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).\n- **CVE-2021-22909:** Chain: router's firmware update procedure uses curl with \"-k\" (insecure) option that disables certificate validation (CWE-295), allowing adversary-in-the-middle (AITM) compromise with a malicious firmware image (CWE-494).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-296: Improper Following of a Certificate's Chain of Trust\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not follow, or incorrectly follows, the chain of trust for a certificate back to a trusted root certificate, resulting in incorrect trust of any resource that is associated with that certificate.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nIf a system does not follow the chain of trust of a certificate to a root server, the certificate loses all usefulness as a metric of trust. Essentially, the trust gained from a certificate is derived from a chain of trust -- with a reputable trusted entity at the end of that list. The end user must trust that reputable source, and this reputable source must vouch for the resource in question through the medium of the certificate.\n\n\nIn some cases, this trust traverses several entities who vouch for one another. The entity trusted by the end user is at one end of this trust chain, while the certificate-wielding resource is at the other end of the chain. If the user receives a certificate at the end of one of these trust chains and then proceeds to check only that the first link in the chain, no real trust has been derived, since the entire chain must be traversed back to a trusted source to verify the certificate.\n\n\nThere are several ways in which the chain of trust might be broken, including but not limited to:\n\n\n  - Any certificate in the chain is self-signed, unless it the root.\n\n  - Not every intermediate certificate is checked, starting from the original certificate all the way up to the root certificate.\n\n  - An intermediate, CA-signed certificate does not have the expected Basic Constraints or other important extensions.\n\n  - The root certificate has been compromised or authorized to the wrong party.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-295\nChildOf -> CWE-573\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2016-2402:** Server allows bypass of certificate pinning by sending a chain of trust that includes a trusted CA that is not pinned.\n- **CVE-2008-4989:** Verification function trusts certificate chains in which the last certificate is self-signed.\n- **CVE-2012-5821:** Chain: Web browser uses a TLS-related function incorrectly, preventing it from verifying that a server's certificate is signed by a trusted certification authority (CA).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-459: Incomplete Cleanup\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly \"clean up\" and remove temporary or supporting resources after they have been used.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nInsufficient Cleanup\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-404\nChildOf -> CWE-404\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** CWE-459 is a child of CWE-404 because, while CWE-404 covers any type of improper shutdown or release of a resource, CWE-459 deals specifically with a multi-step shutdown process in which a crucial step for \"proper\" cleanup is omitted or impossible. That is, CWE-459 deals specifically with a cleanup or shutdown process that does not successfully remove all potentially sensitive data.\n\n**[Relationship]** Overlaps other categories such as permissions and containment. Concept needs further development. This could be primary (e.g. leading to infoleak) or resultant (e.g. resulting from unhandled error conditions or early termination).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2000-0552:** World-readable temporary file not deleted after use.\n- **CVE-2005-2293:** Temporary file not deleted after use, leaking database usernames and passwords.\n- **CVE-2002-0788:** Interaction error creates a temporary file that can not be deleted due to strong permissions.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nCryptographic protocols and systems depend on cryptographic primitives (and associated algorithms) as their basic building blocks. Some common examples of primitives are digital signatures, one-way hash functions, ciphers, and public key cryptography; however, the notion of \"primitive\" can vary depending on point of view. See \"Terminology Notes\" for further explanation of some concepts.\n\n\nCryptographic primitives are defined to accomplish one very specific task in a precisely defined and mathematically reliable fashion. For example, suppose that for a specific cryptographic primitive (such as an encryption routine), the consensus is that the primitive can only be broken after trying out N different inputs (where the larger the value of N, the stronger the cryptography). For an encryption scheme like AES-256, one would expect N to be so large as to be infeasible to execute in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n\nIf a vulnerability is ever found that shows that one can break a cryptographic primitive in significantly less than the expected number of attempts, then that primitive is considered weakened (or sometimes in extreme cases, colloquially it is \"broken\"). As a result, anything using this cryptographic primitive would now be considered insecure or risky. Thus, even breaking or weakening a seemingly small cryptographic primitive has the potential to render the whole system vulnerable, due to its reliance on the primitive. A historical example can be found in TLS when using DES. One would colloquially call DES the cryptographic primitive for transport encryption in this version of TLS. In the past, DES was considered strong, because no weaknesses were found in it; importantly, DES has a key length of 56 bits. Trying N=2^56 keys was considered impractical for most actors. Unfortunately, attacking a system with 56-bit keys is now practical via brute force, which makes defeating DES encryption practical. It is now practical for an adversary to read any information sent under this version of TLS and use this information to attack the system. As a result, it can be claimed that this use of TLS is weak, and that any system depending on TLS with DES could potentially render the entire system vulnerable to attack.\n\n\nCryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are only considered safe after extensive research and review from experienced cryptographers from academia, industry, and government entities looking for any possible flaws. Furthermore, cryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are frequently reevaluated for safety when new mathematical and attack techniques are discovered. As a result and over time, even well-known cryptographic primitives can lose their compliance status with the discovery of novel attacks that might either defeat the algorithm or reduce its robustness significantly.\n\n\nIf ad-hoc cryptographic primitives are implemented, it is almost certain that the implementation will be vulnerable to attacks that are well understood by cryptographers, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information and other consequences.\n\n\nThis weakness is even more difficult to manage for hardware-implemented deployment of cryptographic algorithms. First, because hardware is not patchable as easily as software, any flaw discovered after release and production typically cannot be fixed without a recall of the product. Secondly, the hardware product is often expected to work for years, during which time computation power available to the attacker only increases. Therefore, for hardware implementations of cryptographic primitives, it is absolutely essential that only strong, proven cryptographic primitives are used.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-327\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\n Terminology for cryptography varies widely, from informal and colloquial to mathematically-defined, with different precision and formalism depending on whether the stakeholder is a developer, cryptologist, etc. Yet there is a need for CWE to be self-consistent while remaining understandable and acceptable to multiple audiences.\n\n\nAs of CWE 4.6, CWE terminology around \"primitives\" and \"algorithms\" is emerging as shown by the following example, subject to future consultation and agreement within the CWE and cryptography communities. Suppose one wishes to send encrypted data using a CLI tool such as OpenSSL. One might choose to use AES with a 256-bit key and require tamper protection (GCM mode, for instance). For compatibility's sake, one might also choose the ciphertext to be formatted to the PKCS#5 standard. In this case, the \"cryptographic system\" would be AES-256-GCM with PKCS#5 formatting. The \"cryptographic function\" would be AES-256 in the GCM mode of operation, and the \"algorithm\" would be AES. Colloquially, one would say that AES (and sometimes AES-256) is the \"cryptographic primitive,\" because it is the algorithm that realizes the concept of symmetric encryption (without modes of operation or other protocol related modifications). In practice, developers and architects typically refer to base cryptographic algorithms (AES, SHA, etc.) as cryptographic primitives.\n\n\n**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-4778:** software uses MD5, which is less safe than the default SHA-256 used by related products\n- **CVE-2005-2946:** Default configuration of product uses MD5 instead of stronger algorithms that are available, simplifying forgery of certificates.\n- **CVE-2019-3907:** identity card uses MD5 hash of a salt and password\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product communicates with a host that provides a certificate, but the product does not properly ensure that the certificate is actually associated with that host.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nEven if a certificate is well-formed, signed, and follows the chain of trust, it may simply be a valid certificate for a different site than the site that the product is interacting with. If the certificate's host-specific data is not properly checked - such as the Common Name (CN) in the Subject or the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension of an X.509 certificate - it may be possible for a redirection or spoofing attack to allow a malicious host with a valid certificate to provide data, impersonating a trusted host. In order to ensure data integrity, the certificate must be valid and it must pertain to the site that is being accessed.\n\n\nEven if the product attempts to check the hostname, it is still possible to incorrectly check the hostname. For example, attackers could create a certificate with a name that begins with a trusted name followed by a NUL byte, which could cause some string-based comparisons to only examine the portion that contains the trusted name.\n\n\nThis weakness can occur even when the product uses Certificate Pinning, if the product does not verify the hostname at the time a certificate is pinned.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-923\nChildOf -> CWE-295\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2012-5810:** Mobile banking application does not verify hostname, leading to financial loss.\n- **CVE-2012-5811:** Mobile application for printing documents does not verify hostname, allowing attackers to read sensitive documents.\n- **CVE-2012-5807:** Software for electronic checking does not verify hostname, leading to financial loss.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-370: Missing Check for Certificate Revocation after Initial Check\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not check the revocation status of a certificate after its initial revocation check, which can cause the product to perform privileged actions even after the certificate is revoked at a later time.\n\n### Extended Description\nIf the revocation status of a certificate is not checked before each action that requires privileges, the system may be subject to a race condition. If a certificate is revoked after the initial check, all subsequent actions taken with the owner of the revoked certificate will lose all benefits guaranteed by the certificate. In fact, it is almost certain that the use of a revoked certificate indicates malicious activity.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-299\nPeerOf -> CWE-296\nPeerOf -> CWE-297\nPeerOf -> CWE-298\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nA hard-coded password typically leads to a significant authentication failure that can be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:\n\n```\n\t\tInbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.\n\t\tOutbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.\n```\nIn the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.\n\nThe Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nPeerOf -> CWE-321\nPeerOf -> CWE-257\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry could be split into multiple variants: an inbound variant (as seen in the second demonstrative example) and an outbound variant (as seen in the first demonstrative example). These variants are likely to have different consequences, detectability, etc. More importantly, from a vulnerability theory perspective, they could be characterized as different behaviors.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29964:** Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access\n- **CVE-2021-37555:** Telnet service for IoT feeder for dogs and cats has hard-coded password [REF-1288]\n- **CVE-2021-35033:** Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART port\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.\n- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default \"Allow\" configuration for its authorization settings.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nTOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to \"Time Of Check To Time Of Use\".\nTOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-362\nChildOf -> CWE-362\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** TOCTOU issues do not always involve symlinks, and not every symlink issue is a TOCTOU problem.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Non-symlink TOCTOU issues are not reported frequently, but they are likely to occur in code that attempts to be secure.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2015-1743:** TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed\n- **CVE-2003-0813:** A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.\n- **CVE-2004-0594:** PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.\n\n Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-203 CWE-296 CWE-297 CWE-754 CWE-1240 CWE-345 CWE-667 CWE-367 CWE-295",

Conclusions of Mozillas investigation can be found in the linked google group discussion.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **product:** Certifi\n- **version:** 2022.12.07\n- **component:** root store\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2022-23491 vulnerability:\n\n**1. Relevance to CVE-2022-23491:**\n   - The provided content directly relates to CVE-2022-23491. It describes the vulnerability as the removal of TrustCor root certificates from the certifi package due to concerns about TrustCor's ownership and potential links to spyware development. The NetApp advisory also explicitly mentions CVE-2022-23491 and its impact on their products.\n\n**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n   - The vulnerability isn't due to a flaw in the certifi package itself, but rather the inclusion of TrustCor root certificates, which were later deemed untrustworthy due to their connections to a spyware company. The removal of these certificates addresses the trust issue.\n   - The root cause can be seen as a supply chain issue, where the certifi package bundled a certificate that became a source of concern.\n\n**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n   - **Compromised Trust:** The primary weakness is that the trust placed in the TrustCor root certificates was compromised, as they were linked to a company that produced spyware. This made certificates issued by TrustCor potentially dangerous to use.\n   - **Potential for Data Modification:** The NetApp advisory highlights that successful exploitation \"could lead to addition or modification of data.\" However, this statement is not explained further, and the root of such a vulnerability (which is likely separate from the certificate removal) is not provided. This seems more related to the potential for a MitM-attack, and not the certificate itself.\n   - **Supply Chain Risk:** There's also the broader weakness of supply chain risk, where a commonly used package included a component that was later found to be problematic.\n\n**4. Impact of Exploitation:**\n   - The impact of exploitation, according to the NetApp advisory, is that \"successful exploitation... could lead to addition or modification of data.\"\n   - The main concern was the possibility of a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack if TrustCor were compromised, or acted maliciously. This is because the trust relationship is exploited for malicious purposes, for example to intercept and modify encrypted traffic or other communications, or, in the worst case to issue certificates to malicious entities, causing trust to be wrongly placed in those entities.\n   - This impact was mitigated by distrusting TrustCor's root certificates and thereby removing them from trust chains.\n   - Additionally, there is a risk of disruption of services that rely on those certificates, if not replaced prior to distrust.\n\n**5. Attack Vectors:**\n   - The main attack vector is through man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. If a malicious actor controls or subverts a certificate authority (like TrustCor in this case) they can forge a trusted certificate, and then use this certificate to intercept data passing along a connection.\n\n**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n    - An attacker would have to be in a position to perform a MitM attack. This could mean being on the same network as the victim, or having gained access to a compromised router or other network hardware/infrastructure, or having compromised a DNS server.\n    - The attacker would also have to have gained the ability to issue valid (but potentially malicious) certificates by controlling the compromised root certificate authority, or be able to forge trusted signatures for TLS.\n    - The attacker would need to have control over the certificate authority.\n    - In short, an attacker would need a very high level of sophistication to exploit the vulnerabilities discovered in TrustCor, which is why this problem had to be solved by a policy-level change of distrusting the authority.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The content provides extensive background about the issues leading to the distrust of TrustCor, including its connections to a spyware company (Measurement Systems), the discovery of a spyware SDK in the MsgSafe app, and issues surrounding corporate ownership. The group discussion provides greater details on how various stakeholders within the CA/Browser forum view the company and their behavior.\n- The Mozilla Security team's actions and the subsequent distrust of TrustCor by Google are significant actions, reflecting the seriousness of the situation.\n- The content provides further details of the concerns and the responses from TrustCor beyond that of the CVE description.\n- The conversation also reveals a potential weakness in the supply chain security in the context of commonly used libraries and certificate authorities.\n- The discussion details the complex and multilayered issues surrounding TrustCor's legitimacy as a trusted root certificate authority.\n\nIn summary, CVE-2022-23491 stems from the discovery of an untrustworthy certificate authority, TrustCor, and its connections to a spyware company, necessitating its removal from trusted root stores. The primary vulnerability was the compromised trust, which could have resulted in MitM attacks and other forms of data modification, but was addressed via distrust of TrustCor root certificates.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 345 | Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.253 |\n| 2 | 295 | Improper Certificate Validation | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.155 |\n| 3 | 296 | Improper Following of a Certificate's Chain of Trust | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.141 |\n| 4 | 459 | Incomplete Cleanup | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.128 |\n| 5 | 1240 | Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.126 |\n| 6 | 297 | Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.376 |\n| 7 | 370 | Missing Check for Certificate Revocation after Initial Check | Variant | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 259 | Use of Hard-coded Password | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.126 |\n| 9 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.124 |\n| 10 | 367 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.123 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-693\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).\n- **CVE-2021-22909:** Chain: router's firmware update procedure uses curl with \"-k\" (insecure) option that disables certificate validation (CWE-295), allowing adversary-in-the-middle (AITM) compromise with a malicious firmware image (CWE-494).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-296: Improper Following of a Certificate's Chain of Trust\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not follow, or incorrectly follows, the chain of trust for a certificate back to a trusted root certificate, resulting in incorrect trust of any resource that is associated with that certificate.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nIf a system does not follow the chain of trust of a certificate to a root server, the certificate loses all usefulness as a metric of trust. Essentially, the trust gained from a certificate is derived from a chain of trust -- with a reputable trusted entity at the end of that list. The end user must trust that reputable source, and this reputable source must vouch for the resource in question through the medium of the certificate.\n\n\nIn some cases, this trust traverses several entities who vouch for one another. The entity trusted by the end user is at one end of this trust chain, while the certificate-wielding resource is at the other end of the chain. If the user receives a certificate at the end of one of these trust chains and then proceeds to check only that the first link in the chain, no real trust has been derived, since the entire chain must be traversed back to a trusted source to verify the certificate.\n\n\nThere are several ways in which the chain of trust might be broken, including but not limited to:\n\n\n  - Any certificate in the chain is self-signed, unless it the root.\n\n  - Not every intermediate certificate is checked, starting from the original certificate all the way up to the root certificate.\n\n  - An intermediate, CA-signed certificate does not have the expected Basic Constraints or other important extensions.\n\n  - The root certificate has been compromised or authorized to the wrong party.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-295\nChildOf -> CWE-573\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2016-2402:** Server allows bypass of certificate pinning by sending a chain of trust that includes a trusted CA that is not pinned.\n- **CVE-2008-4989:** Verification function trusts certificate chains in which the last certificate is self-signed.\n- **CVE-2012-5821:** Chain: Web browser uses a TLS-related function incorrectly, preventing it from verifying that a server's certificate is signed by a trusted certification authority (CA).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-459: Incomplete Cleanup\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly \"clean up\" and remove temporary or supporting resources after they have been used.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nInsufficient Cleanup\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-404\nChildOf -> CWE-404\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** CWE-459 is a child of CWE-404 because, while CWE-404 covers any type of improper shutdown or release of a resource, CWE-459 deals specifically with a multi-step shutdown process in which a crucial step for \"proper\" cleanup is omitted or impossible. That is, CWE-459 deals specifically with a cleanup or shutdown process that does not successfully remove all potentially sensitive data.\n\n**[Relationship]** Overlaps other categories such as permissions and containment. Concept needs further development. This could be primary (e.g. leading to infoleak) or resultant (e.g. resulting from unhandled error conditions or early termination).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2000-0552:** World-readable temporary file not deleted after use.\n- **CVE-2005-2293:** Temporary file not deleted after use, leaking database usernames and passwords.\n- **CVE-2002-0788:** Interaction error creates a temporary file that can not be deleted due to strong permissions.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nCryptographic protocols and systems depend on cryptographic primitives (and associated algorithms) as their basic building blocks. Some common examples of primitives are digital signatures, one-way hash functions, ciphers, and public key cryptography; however, the notion of \"primitive\" can vary depending on point of view. See \"Terminology Notes\" for further explanation of some concepts.\n\n\nCryptographic primitives are defined to accomplish one very specific task in a precisely defined and mathematically reliable fashion. For example, suppose that for a specific cryptographic primitive (such as an encryption routine), the consensus is that the primitive can only be broken after trying out N different inputs (where the larger the value of N, the stronger the cryptography). For an encryption scheme like AES-256, one would expect N to be so large as to be infeasible to execute in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n\nIf a vulnerability is ever found that shows that one can break a cryptographic primitive in significantly less than the expected number of attempts, then that primitive is considered weakened (or sometimes in extreme cases, colloquially it is \"broken\"). As a result, anything using this cryptographic primitive would now be considered insecure or risky. Thus, even breaking or weakening a seemingly small cryptographic primitive has the potential to render the whole system vulnerable, due to its reliance on the primitive. A historical example can be found in TLS when using DES. One would colloquially call DES the cryptographic primitive for transport encryption in this version of TLS. In the past, DES was considered strong, because no weaknesses were found in it; importantly, DES has a key length of 56 bits. Trying N=2^56 keys was considered impractical for most actors. Unfortunately, attacking a system with 56-bit keys is now practical via brute force, which makes defeating DES encryption practical. It is now practical for an adversary to read any information sent under this version of TLS and use this information to attack the system. As a result, it can be claimed that this use of TLS is weak, and that any system depending on TLS with DES could potentially render the entire system vulnerable to attack.\n\n\nCryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are only considered safe after extensive research and review from experienced cryptographers from academia, industry, and government entities looking for any possible flaws. Furthermore, cryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are frequently reevaluated for safety when new mathematical and attack techniques are discovered. As a result and over time, even well-known cryptographic primitives can lose their compliance status with the discovery of novel attacks that might either defeat the algorithm or reduce its robustness significantly.\n\n\nIf ad-hoc cryptographic primitives are implemented, it is almost certain that the implementation will be vulnerable to attacks that are well understood by cryptographers, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information and other consequences.\n\n\nThis weakness is even more difficult to manage for hardware-implemented deployment of cryptographic algorithms. First, because hardware is not patchable as easily as software, any flaw discovered after release and production typically cannot be fixed without a recall of the product. Secondly, the hardware product is often expected to work for years, during which time computation power available to the attacker only increases. Therefore, for hardware implementations of cryptographic primitives, it is absolutely essential that only strong, proven cryptographic primitives are used.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-327\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\n Terminology for cryptography varies widely, from informal and colloquial to mathematically-defined, with different precision and formalism depending on whether the stakeholder is a developer, cryptologist, etc. Yet there is a need for CWE to be self-consistent while remaining understandable and acceptable to multiple audiences.\n\n\nAs of CWE 4.6, CWE terminology around \"primitives\" and \"algorithms\" is emerging as shown by the following example, subject to future consultation and agreement within the CWE and cryptography communities. Suppose one wishes to send encrypted data using a CLI tool such as OpenSSL. One might choose to use AES with a 256-bit key and require tamper protection (GCM mode, for instance). For compatibility's sake, one might also choose the ciphertext to be formatted to the PKCS#5 standard. In this case, the \"cryptographic system\" would be AES-256-GCM with PKCS#5 formatting. The \"cryptographic function\" would be AES-256 in the GCM mode of operation, and the \"algorithm\" would be AES. Colloquially, one would say that AES (and sometimes AES-256) is the \"cryptographic primitive,\" because it is the algorithm that realizes the concept of symmetric encryption (without modes of operation or other protocol related modifications). In practice, developers and architects typically refer to base cryptographic algorithms (AES, SHA, etc.) as cryptographic primitives.\n\n\n**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-4778:** software uses MD5, which is less safe than the default SHA-256 used by related products\n- **CVE-2005-2946:** Default configuration of product uses MD5 instead of stronger algorithms that are available, simplifying forgery of certificates.\n- **CVE-2019-3907:** identity card uses MD5 hash of a salt and password\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product communicates with a host that provides a certificate, but the product does not properly ensure that the certificate is actually associated with that host.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nEven if a certificate is well-formed, signed, and follows the chain of trust, it may simply be a valid certificate for a different site than the site that the product is interacting with. If the certificate's host-specific data is not properly checked - such as the Common Name (CN) in the Subject or the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension of an X.509 certificate - it may be possible for a redirection or spoofing attack to allow a malicious host with a valid certificate to provide data, impersonating a trusted host. In order to ensure data integrity, the certificate must be valid and it must pertain to the site that is being accessed.\n\n\nEven if the product attempts to check the hostname, it is still possible to incorrectly check the hostname. For example, attackers could create a certificate with a name that begins with a trusted name followed by a NUL byte, which could cause some string-based comparisons to only examine the portion that contains the trusted name.\n\n\nThis weakness can occur even when the product uses Certificate Pinning, if the product does not verify the hostname at the time a certificate is pinned.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-923\nChildOf -> CWE-295\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2012-5810:** Mobile banking application does not verify hostname, leading to financial loss.\n- **CVE-2012-5811:** Mobile application for printing documents does not verify hostname, allowing attackers to read sensitive documents.\n- **CVE-2012-5807:** Software for electronic checking does not verify hostname, leading to financial loss.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-370: Missing Check for Certificate Revocation after Initial Check\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not check the revocation status of a certificate after its initial revocation check, which can cause the product to perform privileged actions even after the certificate is revoked at a later time.\n\n### Extended Description\nIf the revocation status of a certificate is not checked before each action that requires privileges, the system may be subject to a race condition. If a certificate is revoked after the initial check, all subsequent actions taken with the owner of the revoked certificate will lose all benefits guaranteed by the certificate. In fact, it is almost certain that the use of a revoked certificate indicates malicious activity.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-299\nPeerOf -> CWE-296\nPeerOf -> CWE-297\nPeerOf -> CWE-298\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nA hard-coded password typically leads to a significant authentication failure that can be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:\n\n```\n\t\tInbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.\n\t\tOutbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.\n```\nIn the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.\n\nThe Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nPeerOf -> CWE-321\nPeerOf -> CWE-257\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry could be split into multiple variants: an inbound variant (as seen in the second demonstrative example) and an outbound variant (as seen in the first demonstrative example). These variants are likely to have different consequences, detectability, etc. More importantly, from a vulnerability theory perspective, they could be characterized as different behaviors.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29964:** Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access\n- **CVE-2021-37555:** Telnet service for IoT feeder for dogs and cats has hard-coded password [REF-1288]\n- **CVE-2021-35033:** Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART port\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.\n- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default \"Allow\" configuration for its authorization settings.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nTOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to \"Time Of Check To Time Of Use\".\nTOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-362\nChildOf -> CWE-362\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Relevance to CVE-2022-23491:**\n   - The provided content directly relates to CVE-2022-23491. It describes the vulnerability as the removal of TrustCor root certificates from the certifi package due to concerns about TrustCor's ownership and potential links to spyware development. The NetApp advisory also explicitly mentions CVE-2022-23491 and its impact on their products.\n\n**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n   - The vulnerability isn't due to a flaw in the certifi package itself, but rather the inclusion of TrustCor root certificates, which were later deemed untrustworthy due to their connections to a spyware company. The removal of these certificates addresses the trust issue.\n   - The root cause can be seen as a supply chain issue, where the certifi package bundled a certificate that became a source of concern.\n\n**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n   - **Compromised Trust:** The primary weakness is that the trust placed in the TrustCor root certificates was compromised, as they were linked to a company that produced spyware. This made certificates issued by TrustCor potentially dangerous to use.\n   - **Potential for Data Modification:** The NetApp advisory highlights that successful exploitation \"could lead to addition or modification of data.\" However, this statement is not explained further, and the root of such a vulnerability (which is likely separate from the certificate removal) is not provided. This seems more related to the potential for a MitM-attack, and not the certificate itself.\n   - **Supply Chain Risk:** There's also the broader weakness of supply chain risk, where a commonly used package included a component that was later found to be problematic.\n\n**4. Impact of Exploitation:**\n   - The impact of exploitation, according to the NetApp advisory, is that \"successful exploitation... could lead to addition or modification of data.\"\n   - The main concern was the possibility of a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack if TrustCor were compromised, or acted maliciously. This is because the trust relationship is exploited for malicious purposes, for example to intercept and modify encrypted traffic or other communications, or, in the worst case to issue certificates to malicious entities, causing trust to be wrongly placed in those entities.\n   - This impact was mitigated by distrusting TrustCor's root certificates and thereby removing them from trust chains.\n   - Additionally, there is a risk of disruption of services that rely on those certificates, if not replaced prior to distrust.\n\n**5. Attack Vectors:**\n   - The main attack vector is through man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. If a malicious actor controls or subverts a certificate authority (like TrustCor in this case) they can forge a trusted certificate, and then use this certificate to intercept data passing along a connection.\n\n**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n    - An attacker would have to be in a position to perform a MitM attack. This could mean being on the same network as the victim, or having gained access to a compromised router or other network hardware/infrastructure, or having compromised a DNS server.\n    - The attacker would also have to have gained the ability to issue valid (but potentially malicious) certificates by controlling the compromised root certificate authority, or be able to forge trusted signatures for TLS.\n    - The attacker would need to have control over the certificate authority.\n    - In short, an attacker would need a very high level of sophistication to exploit the vulnerabilities discovered in TrustCor, which is why this problem had to be solved by a policy-level change of distrusting the authority.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The content provides extensive background about the issues leading to the distrust of TrustCor, including its connections to a spyware company (Measurement Systems), the discovery of a spyware SDK in the MsgSafe app, and issues surrounding corporate ownership. The group discussion provides greater details on how various stakeholders within the CA/Browser forum view the company and their behavior.\n- The Mozilla Security team's actions and the subsequent distrust of TrustCor by Google are significant actions, reflecting the seriousness of the situation.\n- The content provides further details of the concerns and the responses from TrustCor beyond that of the CVE description.\n- The conversation also reveals a potential weakness in the supply chain security in the context of commonly used libraries and certificate authorities.\n- The discussion details the complex and multilayered issues surrounding TrustCor's legitimacy as a trusted root certificate authority.\n\nIn summary, CVE-2022-23491 stems from the discovery of an untrustworthy certificate authority, TrustCor, and its connections to a spyware company, necessitating its removal from trusted root stores. The primary vulnerability was the compromised trust, which could have resulted in MitM attacks and other forms of data modification, but was addressed via distrust of TrustCor root certificates.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 345 | Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.253 |\n| 2 | 295 | Improper Certificate Validation | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.155 |\n| 3 | 296 | Improper Following of a Certificate's Chain of Trust | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.141 |\n| 4 | 459 | Incomplete Cleanup | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.128 |\n| 5 | 1240 | Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.126 |\n| 6 | 297 | Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.376 |\n| 7 | 370 | Missing Check for Certificate Revocation after Initial Check | Variant | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 259 | Use of Hard-coded Password | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.126 |\n| 9 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.124 |\n| 10 | 367 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.123 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-693\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

Essentially, the trust gained from a certificate is derived from a chain of trust -- with a reputable trusted entity at the end of that list. The end user must trust that reputable source, and this reputable source must vouch for the resource in question through the medium of the certificate.\n\n\nIn some cases, this trust traverses several entities who vouch for one another. The entity trusted by the end user is at one end of this trust chain, while the certificate-wielding resource is at the other end of the chain. If the user receives a certificate at the end of one of these trust chains and then proceeds to check only that the first link in the chain, no real trust has been derived, since the entire chain must be traversed back to a trusted source to verify the certificate.\n\n\nThere are several ways in which the chain of trust might be broken, including but not limited to:\n\n\n  - Any certificate in the chain is self-signed, unless it the root.\n\n  - Not every intermediate certificate is checked, starting from the original certificate all the way up to the root certificate.\n\n  - An intermediate, CA-signed certificate does not have the expected Basic Constraints or other important extensions.\n\n  - The root certificate has been compromised or authorized to the wrong party.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-295\nChildOf -> CWE-573\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** CWE-459 is a child of CWE-404 because, while CWE-404 covers any type of improper shutdown or release of a resource, CWE-459 deals specifically with a multi-step shutdown process in which a crucial step for \"proper\" cleanup is omitted or impossible. That is, CWE-459 deals specifically with a cleanup or shutdown process that does not successfully remove all potentially sensitive data.\n\n**[Relationship]** Overlaps other categories such as permissions and containment. Concept needs further development. This could be primary (e.g. leading to infoleak) or resultant (e.g. resulting from unhandled error conditions or early termination).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2000-0552:** World-readable temporary file not deleted after use.\n- **CVE-2005-2293:** Temporary file not deleted after use, leaking database usernames and passwords.\n- **CVE-2002-0788:** Interaction error creates a temporary file that can not be deleted due to strong permissions.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nCryptographic protocols and systems depend on cryptographic primitives (and associated algorithms) as their basic building blocks. Some common examples of primitives are digital signatures, one-way hash functions, ciphers, and public key cryptography; however, the notion of \"primitive\" can vary depending on point of view. See \"Terminology Notes\" for further explanation of some concepts.\n\n\nCryptographic primitives are defined to accomplish one very specific task in a precisely defined and mathematically reliable fashion. For example, suppose that for a specific cryptographic primitive (such as an encryption routine), the consensus is that the primitive can only be broken after trying out N different inputs (where the larger the value of N, the stronger the cryptography). For an encryption scheme like AES-256, one would expect N to be so large as to be infeasible to execute in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n\nIf a vulnerability is ever found that shows that one can break a cryptographic primitive in significantly less than the expected number of attempts, then that primitive is considered weakened (or sometimes in extreme cases, colloquially it is \"broken\"). As a result, anything using this cryptographic primitive would now be considered insecure or risky. Thus, even breaking or weakening a seemingly small cryptographic primitive has the potential to render the whole system vulnerable, due to its reliance on the primitive. A historical example can be found in TLS when using DES. One would colloquially call DES the cryptographic primitive for transport encryption in this version of TLS. In the past, DES was considered strong, because no weaknesses were found in it; importantly, DES has a key length of 56 bits. Trying N=2^56 keys was considered impractical for most actors. Unfortunately, attacking a system with 56-bit keys is now practical via brute force, which makes defeating DES encryption practical. It is now practical for an adversary to read any information sent under this version of TLS and use this information to attack the system. As a result, it can be claimed that this use of TLS is weak, and that any system depending on TLS with DES could potentially render the entire system vulnerable to attack.\n\n\nCryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are only considered safe after extensive research and review from experienced cryptographers from academia, industry, and government entities looking for any possible flaws. Furthermore, cryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are frequently reevaluated for safety when new mathematical and attack techniques are discovered. As a result and over time, even well-known cryptographic primitives can lose their compliance status with the discovery of novel attacks that might either defeat the algorithm or reduce its robustness significantly.\n\n\nIf ad-hoc cryptographic primitives are implemented, it is almost certain that the implementation will be vulnerable to attacks that are well understood by cryptographers, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information and other consequences.\n\n\nThis weakness is even more difficult to manage for hardware-implemented deployment of cryptographic algorithms. First, because hardware is not patchable as easily as software, any flaw discovered after release and production typically cannot be fixed without a recall of the product. Secondly, the hardware product is often expected to work for years, during which time computation power available to the attacker only increases. Therefore, for hardware implementations of cryptographic primitives, it is absolutely essential that only strong, proven cryptographic primitives are used.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-327\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\n Terminology for cryptography varies widely, from informal and colloquial to mathematically-defined, with different precision and formalism depending on whether the stakeholder is a developer, cryptologist, etc. Yet there is a need for CWE to be self-consistent while remaining understandable and acceptable to multiple audiences.\n\n\nAs of CWE 4.6, CWE terminology around \"primitives\" and \"algorithms\" is emerging as shown by the following example, subject to future consultation and agreement within the CWE and cryptography communities. Suppose one wishes to send encrypted data using a CLI tool such as OpenSSL. One might choose to use AES with a 256-bit key and require tamper protection (GCM mode, for instance). For compatibility's sake, one might also choose the ciphertext to be formatted to the PKCS#5 standard. In this case, the \"cryptographic system\" would be AES-256-GCM with PKCS#5 formatting. The \"cryptographic function\" would be AES-256 in the GCM mode of operation, and the \"algorithm\" would be AES. Colloquially, one would say that AES (and sometimes AES-256) is the \"cryptographic primitive,\" because it is the algorithm that realizes the concept of symmetric encryption (without modes of operation or other protocol related modifications). In practice, developers and architects typically refer to base cryptographic algorithms (AES, SHA, etc.) as cryptographic primitives.\n\n\n**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-4778:** software uses MD5, which is less safe than the default SHA-256 used by related products\n- **CVE-2005-2946:** Default configuration of product uses MD5 instead of stronger algorithms that are available, simplifying forgery of certificates.\n- **CVE-2019-3907:** identity card uses MD5 hash of a salt and password\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product communicates with a host that provides a certificate, but the product does not properly ensure that the certificate is actually associated with that host.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nEven if a certificate is well-formed, signed, and follows the chain of trust, it may simply be a valid certificate for a different site than the site that the product is interacting with. If the certificate's host-specific data is not properly checked - such as the Common Name (CN) in the Subject or the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension of an X.509 certificate - it may be possible for a redirection or spoofing attack to allow a malicious host with a valid certificate to provide data, impersonating a trusted host. In order to ensure data integrity, the certificate must be valid and it must pertain to the site that is being accessed.\n\n\nEven if the product attempts to check the hostname, it is still possible to incorrectly check the hostname. For example, attackers could create a certificate with a name that begins with a trusted name followed by a NUL byte, which could cause some string-based comparisons to only examine the portion that contains the trusted name.\n\n\nThis weakness can occur even when the product uses Certificate Pinning, if the product does not verify the hostname at the time a certificate is pinned.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-923\nChildOf -> CWE-295\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2012-5810:** Mobile banking application does not verify hostname, leading to financial loss.\n- **CVE-2012-5811:** Mobile application for printing documents does not verify hostname, allowing attackers to read sensitive documents.\n- **CVE-2012-5807:** Software for electronic checking does not verify hostname, leading to financial loss.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-370: Missing Check for Certificate Revocation after Initial Check\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not check the revocation status of a certificate after its initial revocation check, which can cause the product to perform privileged actions even after the certificate is revoked at a later time.\n\n### Extended Description\nIf the revocation status of a certificate is not checked before each action that requires privileges, the system may be subject to a race condition. If a certificate is revoked after the initial check, all subsequent actions taken with the owner of the revoked certificate will lose all benefits guaranteed by the certificate. In fact, it is almost certain that the use of a revoked certificate indicates malicious activity.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-299\nPeerOf -> CWE-296\nPeerOf -> CWE-297\nPeerOf -> CWE-298\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nA hard-coded password typically leads to a significant authentication failure that can be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:\n\n```\n\t\tInbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.\n\t\tOutbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.\n```\nIn the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.\n\nThe Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nPeerOf -> CWE-321\nPeerOf -> CWE-257\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry could be split into multiple variants: an inbound variant (as seen in the second demonstrative example) and an outbound variant (as seen in the first demonstrative example). These variants are likely to have different consequences, detectability, etc. More importantly, from a vulnerability theory perspective, they could be characterized as different behaviors.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29964:** Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access\n- **CVE-2021-37555:** Telnet service for IoT feeder for dogs and cats has hard-coded password [REF-1288]\n- **CVE-2021-35033:** Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART port\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.\n- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default \"Allow\" configuration for its authorization settings.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nTOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to \"Time Of Check To Time Of Use\".\nTOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-362\nChildOf -> CWE-362\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** TOCTOU issues do not always involve symlinks, and not every symlink issue is a TOCTOU problem.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Non-symlink TOCTOU issues are not reported frequently, but they are likely to occur in code that attempts to be secure.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2015-1743:** TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed\n- **CVE-2003-0813:** A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.\n- **CVE-2004-0594:** PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.\n\n Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-203 CWE-296 CWE-297 CWE-754 CWE-1240 CWE-345 CWE-667 CWE-367 CWE-295",
