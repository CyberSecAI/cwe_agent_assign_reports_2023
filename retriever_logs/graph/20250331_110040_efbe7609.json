Initially, the application used a blacklist approach (`isDangerFilename`) to block potentially harmful file extensions. However, this was deemed inefficient, and a switch to a whitelist approach (`isAllowedFilename`) was implemented. The core issue arises from an improper implementation or oversight in the whitelist, potentially allowing for the upload of unexpected or malicious file types.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Inadequate Whitelist Implementation:** The commit introduces a whitelist of allowed file extensions. However, the provided code snippet might be incomplete or contain errors in the list of allowed extensions. The code comment \"// \u5224\u65ad\u4e0a\u4f20\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u6269\u5c55\u540d\u662f\u5426\u5904\u4e8e\u767d\u540d\u5355\u5185\" indicates intention for a whitelist approach. The implementation relies on string matching of the file extension, which can be circumvented using techniques such as filename manipulation.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Arbitrary File Upload:** A successful attack could allow an attacker to upload arbitrary files, including executable files, scripts, or other malicious content.\n- **Remote Code Execution:** If the uploaded files are then accessed or executed by the application, this could lead to remote code execution, potentially granting full control of the server to the attacker.\n- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If the application serves the uploaded files directly, it could be exploited for XSS by uploading HTML or JavaScript files.\n- **Data Exfiltration/Corruption:** An attacker could potentially upload files that overwrite existing sensitive data or inject malicious content into the application.\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By uploading large volumes of files, the attacker could also cause denial of service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The primary attack vector is the file upload functionality in the `AttachmentController.class.php`.\n- The attacker would likely attempt to upload a file with an extension not correctly handled by the whitelist, or manipulate the filename to bypass the extension check.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to have access to the file upload functionality of the application.\n- The attacker would require an understanding of how file uploads are handled within the application to craft malicious filenames.\n- An attacker with a user account could potentially exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The commit message \"file upload bug\" and the code comments highlight the awareness of a problem with the file upload functionality, and the change from a blacklist to a whitelist approach.\n- The use of `strtolower` on the extension before matching helps, but is not a full fix.\n- The implementation is using `strripos` to find the last occurrence of a dot and extract the extension, which is standard.\n- The addition of various file types into the whitelist, including executable archives (`.zip,.tar,.gz,.tgz,.ipa,.apk,.rar,.iso,.bz2`) increases the risk of exploitability if not properly handled by the server.\n- The use of `json_encode` to display errors suggests that an API endpoint is used for the upload functionality.\n\nIn summary, this commit aims to fix a file upload vulnerability by moving to a whitelist approach. However, based on the code diff, the implementation of the whitelist could be flawed if not exhaustive, and allow for circumvention with file extension manipulation techniques. This vulnerability could lead to arbitrary file upload and potentially remote code execution.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 434 | Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.233 |\n| 2 | 436 | Interpretation Conflict | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.145 |\n| 3 | 25 | Path Traversal: '/../filedir' | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.138 |\n| 4 | 1289 | Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.127 |\n| 5 | 749 | Exposed Dangerous Method or Function | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.125 |\n| 6 | 646 | Reliance on File Name or Extension of Externally-Supplied File | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.558 |\n| 7 | 41 | Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 88 | Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.122 |\n| 9 | 23 | Relative Path Traversal | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.122 |\n| 10 | 637 | Unnecessary Complexity in Protection Mechanism (Not Using 'Economy of Mechanism') | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.122 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nUnrestricted File Upload: Used in vulnerability databases and elsewhere, but it is insufficiently precise. The phrase could be interpreted as the lack of restrictions on the size or number of uploaded files, which is a resource consumption issue.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-669\nChildOf -> CWE-669\nPeerOf -> CWE-351\nPeerOf -> CWE-436\nPeerOf -> CWE-430\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThis can have a chaining relationship with incomplete denylist / permissive allowlist errors when the product tries, but fails, to properly limit which types of files are allowed (CWE-183, CWE-184).\n\n\nThis can also overlap multiple interpretation errors for intermediaries, e.g. anti-virus products that do not remove or quarantine attachments with certain file extensions that can be processed by client systems.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-5227:** PHP-based FAQ management app does not check the MIME type for uploaded images\n- **CVE-2001-0901:** Web-based mail product stores \".shtml\" attachments that could contain SSI\n- **CVE-2002-1841:** PHP upload does not restrict file types\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-436: Interpretation Conflict\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nProduct A handles inputs or steps differently than Product B, which causes A to perform incorrect actions based on its perception of B's state.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis is generally found in proxies, firewalls, anti-virus software, and other intermediary devices that monitor, allow, deny, or modify traffic based on how the client or server is expected to behave.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-435\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2005-1215:** Bypass filters or poison web cache using requests with multiple Content-Length headers, a non-standard behavior.\n- **CVE-2002-0485:** Anti-virus product allows bypass via Content-Type and Content-Disposition headers that are mixed case, which are still processed by some clients.\n- **CVE-2002-1978:** FTP clients sending a command with \"PASV\" in the argument can cause firewalls to misinterpret the server's error as a valid response, allowing filter bypass.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-25: Path Traversal: '/../filedir'\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize \"/../\" sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.\n\n\nSometimes a program checks for \"../\" at the beginning of the input, so a \"/../\" can bypass that check.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-23\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-20775:** A cloud management tool allows attackers to bypass the restricted shell using path traversal sequences like \"/../\" in the USER environment variable.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAttackers can sometimes bypass input validation schemes by finding inputs that appear to be safe, but will be dangerous when processed at a lower layer or by a downstream component. For example, a simple XSS protection mechanism might try to validate that an input has no \"<script>\" tags using case-sensitive matching, but since HTML is case-insensitive when processed by web browsers, an attacker could inject \"<ScrIpT>\" and trigger XSS.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nPeerOf -> CWE-41\nPeerOf -> CWE-178\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.\n- **CVE-2020-11053:** Chain: Go-based Oauth2 reverse proxy can send the authenticated user to another site at the end of the authentication flow. A redirect URL with HTML-encoded whitespace characters can bypass the validation (CWE-1289) to redirect to a malicious site (CWE-601)\n- **CVE-2005-0269:** File extension check in forum software only verifies extensions that contain all lowercase letters, which allows remote attackers to upload arbitrary files via file extensions that include uppercase letters.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product provides an Applications Programming Interface (API) or similar interface for interaction with external actors, but the interface includes a dangerous method or function that is not properly restricted.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis weakness can lead to a wide variety of resultant weaknesses, depending on the behavior of the exposed method. It can apply to any number of technologies and approaches, such as ActiveX controls, Java functions, IOCTLs, and so on.\n\n\nThe exposure can occur in a few different ways:\n\n\n  - The function/method was never intended to be exposed to outside actors.\n\n  - The function/method was only intended to be accessible to a limited set of actors, such as Internet-based access from a single web site.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Research Gap]** Under-reported and under-studied. This weakness could appear in any technology, language, or framework that allows the programmer to provide a functional interface to external parties, but it is not heavily reported. In 2007, CVE began showing a notable increase in reports of exposed method vulnerabilities in ActiveX applications, as well as IOCTL access to OS-level resources. These weaknesses have been documented for Java applications in various secure programming sources, but there are few reports in CVE, which suggests limited awareness in most parts of the vulnerability research community.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2007-6382:** arbitrary Java code execution via exposed method\n- **CVE-2007-1112:** security tool ActiveX control allows download or upload of files\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-646: Reliance on File Name or Extension of Externally-Supplied File\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product allows a file to be uploaded, but it relies on the file name or extension of the file to determine the appropriate behaviors. This could be used by attackers to cause the file to be misclassified and processed in a dangerous fashion.\n\n### Extended Description\nAn application might use the file name or extension of a user-supplied file to determine the proper course of action, such as selecting the correct process to which control should be passed, deciding what data should be made available, or what resources should be allocated. If the attacker can cause the code to misclassify the supplied file, then the wrong action could occur. For example, an attacker could supply a file that ends in a \".php.gif\" extension that appears to be a GIF image, but would be processed as PHP code. In extreme cases, code execution is possible, but the attacker could also cause exhaustion of resources, denial of service, exposure of debug or system data (including application source code), or being bound to a particular server side process. This weakness may be due to a vulnerability in any of the technologies used by the web and application servers, due to misconfiguration, or resultant from another flaw in the application itself.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-345\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n\n### Extended Description\nPath equivalence is usually employed in order to circumvent access controls expressed using an incomplete set of file name or file path representations. This is different from path traversal, wherein the manipulations are performed to generate a name for a different object.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Some of these manipulations could be effective in path traversal issues, too.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2000-1114:** Source code disclosure using trailing dot\n- **CVE-2002-1986:** Source code disclosure using trailing dot\n- **CVE-2004-2213:** Source code disclosure using trailing dot or trailing encoding space \"%20\"\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen creating commands using interpolation into a string, developers may assume that only the arguments/options that they specify will be processed. This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-77\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** At one layer of abstraction, this can overlap other weaknesses that have whitespace problems, e.g. injection of javascript into attributes of HTML tags.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-36069:** Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n- **CVE-1999-0113:** Canonical Example - \"-froot\" argument is passed on to another program, where the \"-f\" causes execution as user \"root\"\n- **CVE-2001-0150:** Web browser executes Telnet sessions using command line arguments that are specified by the web site, which could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nZip Slip: \"Zip slip\" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282]. It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-22\nChildOf -> CWE-22\nChildOf -> CWE-22\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n- **CVE-2019-20916:** Python package manager does not correctly restrict the filename specified in a Content-Disposition header, allowing arbitrary file read using path traversal sequences such as \"../\"\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-637: Unnecessary Complexity in Protection Mechanism (Not Using 'Economy of Mechanism')\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a more complex mechanism than necessary, which could lead to resultant weaknesses when the mechanism is not correctly understood, modeled, configured, implemented, or used.\n\n### Extended Description\nSecurity mechanisms should be as simple as possible. Complex security mechanisms may engender partial implementations and compatibility problems, with resulting mismatches in assumptions and implemented security. A corollary of this principle is that data specifications should be as simple as possible, because complex data specifications result in complex validation code. Complex tasks and systems may also need to be guarded by complex security checks, so simple systems should be preferred.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nUnnecessary Complexity\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-657\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2007-6067:** Support for complex regular expressions leads to a resultant algorithmic complexity weakness (CWE-407).\n- **CVE-2007-1552:** Either a filename extension and a Content-Type header could be used to infer the file type, but the developer only checks the Content-Type, enabling unrestricted file upload (CWE-434).\n- **CVE-2007-6479:** In Apache environments, a \"filename.php.gif\" can be redirected to the PHP interpreter instead of being sent as an image/gif directly to the user. Not knowing this, the developer only checks the last extension of a submitted filename, enabling arbitrary code execution.\n\n Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-552 CWE-434 CWE-41 CWE-1289 CWE-88 CWE-73 CWE-22 CWE-23",

This weakness could appear in any technology, language, or framework that allows the programmer to provide a functional interface to external parties, but it is not heavily reported. In 2007, CVE began showing a notable increase in reports of exposed method vulnerabilities in ActiveX applications, as well as IOCTL access to OS-level resources. These weaknesses have been documented for Java applications in various secure programming sources, but there are few reports in CVE, which suggests limited awareness in most parts of the vulnerability research community.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2007-6382:** arbitrary Java code execution via exposed method\n- **CVE-2007-1112:** security tool ActiveX control allows download or upload of files\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-646: Reliance on File Name or Extension of Externally-Supplied File\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product allows a file to be uploaded, but it relies on the file name or extension of the file to determine the appropriate behaviors. This could be used by attackers to cause the file to be misclassified and processed in a dangerous fashion.\n\n### Extended Description\nAn application might use the file name or extension of a user-supplied file to determine the proper course of action, such as selecting the correct process to which control should be passed, deciding what data should be made available, or what resources should be allocated. If the attacker can cause the code to misclassify the supplied file, then the wrong action could occur. For example, an attacker could supply a file that ends in a \".php.gif\" extension that appears to be a GIF image, but would be processed as PHP code. In extreme cases, code execution is possible, but the attacker could also cause exhaustion of resources, denial of service, exposure of debug or system data (including application source code), or being bound to a particular server side process. This weakness may be due to a vulnerability in any of the technologies used by the web and application servers, due to misconfiguration, or resultant from another flaw in the application itself.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-345\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-77\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Complex security mechanisms may engender partial implementations and compatibility problems, with resulting mismatches in assumptions and implemented security. A corollary of this principle is that data specifications should be as simple as possible, because complex data specifications result in complex validation code.

    "enhanced_query": "## Vulnerability Description\nUnrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type in GitHub repository star7th/showdoc prior to 2.10.4.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **weakness:** **unrestricted upload of file with dangerous type**\n- **product:** star7th/showdoc\n- **version:** prior to 2.10.4\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a flawed approach to file upload security in the `showdoc` application. Initially, the application used a blacklist approach (`isDangerFilename`) to block potentially harmful file extensions. However, this was deemed inefficient, and a switch to a whitelist approach (`isAllowedFilename`) was implemented. The core issue arises from an improper implementation or oversight in the whitelist, potentially allowing for the upload of unexpected or malicious file types.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Inadequate Whitelist Implementation:** The commit introduces a whitelist of allowed file extensions. However, the provided code snippet might be incomplete or contain errors in the list of allowed extensions. The code comment \"// \u5224\u65ad\u4e0a\u4f20\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u6269\u5c55\u540d\u662f\u5426\u5904\u4e8e\u767d\u540d\u5355\u5185\" indicates intention for a whitelist approach. The implementation relies on string matching of the file extension, which can be circumvented using techniques such as filename manipulation.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Arbitrary File Upload:** A successful attack could allow an attacker to upload arbitrary files, including executable files, scripts, or other malicious content.\n- **Remote Code Execution:** If the uploaded files are then accessed or executed by the application, this could lead to remote code execution, potentially granting full control of the server to the attacker.\n- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If the application serves the uploaded files directly, it could be exploited for XSS by uploading HTML or JavaScript files.\n- **Data Exfiltration/Corruption:** An attacker could potentially upload files that overwrite existing sensitive data or inject malicious content into the application.\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By uploading large volumes of files, the attacker could also cause denial of service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The primary attack vector is the file upload functionality in the `AttachmentController.class.php`.\n- The attacker would likely attempt to upload a file with an extension not correctly handled by the whitelist, or manipulate the filename to bypass the extension check.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to have access to the file upload functionality of the application.\n- The attacker would require an understanding of how file uploads are handled within the application to craft malicious filenames.\n- An attacker with a user account could potentially exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The commit message \"file upload bug\" and the code comments highlight the awareness of a problem with the file upload functionality, and the change from a blacklist to a whitelist approach.\n- The use of `strtolower` on the extension before matching helps, but is not a full fix.\n- The implementation is using `strripos` to find the last occurrence of a dot and extract the extension, which is standard.\n- The addition of various file types into the whitelist, including executable archives (`.zip,.tar,.gz,.tgz,.ipa,.apk,.rar,.iso,.bz2`) increases the risk of exploitability if not properly handled by the server.\n- The use of `json_encode` to display errors suggests that an API endpoint is used for the upload functionality.\n\nIn summary, this commit aims to fix a file upload vulnerability by moving to a whitelist approach. However, based on the code diff, the implementation of the whitelist could be flawed if not exhaustive, and allow for circumvention with file extension manipulation techniques. This vulnerability could lead to arbitrary file upload and potentially remote code execution.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 434 | Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.233 |\n| 2 | 436 | Interpretation Conflict | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.145 |\n| 3 | 25 | Path Traversal: '/../filedir' | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.138 |\n| 4 | 1289 | Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.127 |\n| 5 | 749 | Exposed Dangerous Method or Function | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.125 |\n| 6 | 646 | Reliance on File Name or Extension of Externally-Supplied File | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.558 |\n| 7 | 41 | Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 88 | Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.122 |\n| 9 | 23 | Relative Path Traversal | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.122 |\n| 10 | 637 | Unnecessary Complexity in Protection Mechanism (Not Using 'Economy of Mechanism') | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.122 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nUnrestricted File Upload: Used in vulnerability databases and elsewhere, but it is insufficiently precise.

A redirect URL with HTML-encoded whitespace characters can bypass the validation (CWE-1289) to redirect to a malicious site (CWE-601)\n- **CVE-2005-0269:** File extension check in forum software only verifies extensions that contain all lowercase letters, which allows remote attackers to upload arbitrary files via file extensions that include uppercase letters.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product provides an Applications Programming Interface (API) or similar interface for interaction with external actors, but the interface includes a dangerous method or function that is not properly restricted.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis weakness can lead to a wide variety of resultant weaknesses, depending on the behavior of the exposed method. It can apply to any number of technologies and approaches, such as ActiveX controls, Java functions, IOCTLs, and so on.\n\n\nThe exposure can occur in a few different ways:\n\n\n  - The function/method was never intended to be exposed to outside actors.\n\n  - The function/method was only intended to be accessible to a limited set of actors, such as Internet-based access from a single web site.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Research Gap]** Under-reported and under-studied. This weakness could appear in any technology, language, or framework that allows the programmer to provide a functional interface to external parties, but it is not heavily reported. In 2007, CVE began showing a notable increase in reports of exposed method vulnerabilities in ActiveX applications, as well as IOCTL access to OS-level resources. These weaknesses have been documented for Java applications in various secure programming sources, but there are few reports in CVE, which suggests limited awareness in most parts of the vulnerability research community.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2007-6382:** arbitrary Java code execution via exposed method\n- **CVE-2007-1112:** security tool ActiveX control allows download or upload of files\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-646: Reliance on File Name or Extension of Externally-Supplied File\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product allows a file to be uploaded, but it relies on the file name or extension of the file to determine the appropriate behaviors. This could be used by attackers to cause the file to be misclassified and processed in a dangerous fashion.\n\n### Extended Description\nAn application might use the file name or extension of a user-supplied file to determine the proper course of action, such as selecting the correct process to which control should be passed, deciding what data should be made available, or what resources should be allocated. If the attacker can cause the code to misclassify the supplied file, then the wrong action could occur. For example, an attacker could supply a file that ends in a \".php.gif\" extension that appears to be a GIF image, but would be processed as PHP code. In extreme cases, code execution is possible, but the attacker could also cause exhaustion of resources, denial of service, exposure of debug or system data (including application source code), or being bound to a particular server side process. This weakness may be due to a vulnerability in any of the technologies used by the web and application servers, due to misconfiguration, or resultant from another flaw in the application itself.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-345\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n\n### Extended Description\nPath equivalence is usually employed in order to circumvent access controls expressed using an incomplete set of file name or file path representations. This is different from path traversal, wherein the manipulations are performed to generate a name for a different object.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Some of these manipulations could be effective in path traversal issues, too.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2000-1114:** Source code disclosure using trailing dot\n- **CVE-2002-1986:** Source code disclosure using trailing dot\n- **CVE-2004-2213:** Source code disclosure using trailing dot or trailing encoding space \"%20\"\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen creating commands using interpolation into a string, developers may assume that only the arguments/options that they specify will be processed. This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-77\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** At one layer of abstraction, this can overlap other weaknesses that have whitespace problems, e.g. injection of javascript into attributes of HTML tags.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-36069:** Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n- **CVE-1999-0113:** Canonical Example - \"-froot\" argument is passed on to another program, where the \"-f\" causes execution as user \"root\"\n- **CVE-2001-0150:** Web browser executes Telnet sessions using command line arguments that are specified by the web site, which could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nZip Slip: \"Zip slip\" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282]. It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-22\nChildOf -> CWE-22\nChildOf -> CWE-22\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n- **CVE-2019-20916:** Python package manager does not correctly restrict the filename specified in a Content-Disposition header, allowing arbitrary file read using path traversal sequences such as \"../\"\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-637: Unnecessary Complexity in Protection Mechanism (Not Using 'Economy of Mechanism')\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a more complex mechanism than necessary, which could lead to resultant weaknesses when the mechanism is not correctly understood, modeled, configured, implemented, or used.\n\n### Extended Description\nSecurity mechanisms should be as simple as possible. Complex security mechanisms may engender partial implementations and compatibility problems, with resulting mismatches in assumptions and implemented security. A corollary of this principle is that data specifications should be as simple as possible, because complex data specifications result in complex validation code. Complex tasks and systems may also need to be guarded by complex security checks, so simple systems should be preferred.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nUnnecessary Complexity\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-657\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2007-6067:** Support for complex regular expressions leads to a resultant algorithmic complexity weakness (CWE-407).\n- **CVE-2007-1552:** Either a filename extension and a Content-Type header could be used to infer the file type, but the developer only checks the Content-Type, enabling unrestricted file upload (CWE-434).\n- **CVE-2007-6479:** In Apache environments, a \"filename.php.gif\" can be redirected to the PHP interpreter instead of being sent as an image/gif directly to the user. Not knowing this, the developer only checks the last extension of a submitted filename, enabling arbitrary code execution.\n\n Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-552 CWE-434 CWE-41 CWE-1289 CWE-88 CWE-73 CWE-22 CWE-23",
