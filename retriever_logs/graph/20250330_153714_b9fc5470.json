Given a sufficiently large number of actions, while copying and reserving memory for a new action of a new flow, the reserve_sfa_size() function does not return -EMSGSIZE as expected, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds write access. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **integer coercion error**\n- **impact:** crash or potentially escalate privileges\n- **vector:** out-of-bounds write access\n- **attacker:** local user\n- **product:** openvswitch kernel module\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2639:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   An integer underflow vulnerability exists within the `reserve_sfa_size()` function in the openvswitch kernel module.\n*   The vulnerability occurs when calculating the required size for flow actions. Specifically, when `next_offset` is close to `MAX_ACTIONS_BUFSIZE` and a new action with `req_size` is added, instead of returning `-EMSGSIZE`, the code allocates `MAX_ACTIONS_BUFSIZE` bytes, incrementing `actions_len` by `req_size`. This leads to `actions_len` exceeding the allocated buffer size.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Integer Underflow:** The core issue is an incorrect check for sufficient buffer space before allocating memory for flow actions, which leads to an integer underflow and an out-of-bounds (OOB) write.\n*   **Out-of-Bounds Write:** The incorrect size calculation causes `reserve_sfa_size()` to allocate a larger buffer size than intended and when subsequent actions are copied, they are written past the end of the allocated memory.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Crash:** A local user can trigger the vulnerability, resulting in a system crash due to the out-of-bounds write.\n*   **Potential Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability may also allow a local user to potentially escalate their privileges due to memory corruption.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **Local User:** The attack vector is a local user interacting with the system and the openvswitch module.\n*   **Flow Actions:** Exploitation involves crafting a flow with a large number of actions, causing the `reserve_sfa_size()` function to miscalculate the memory requirements for the flow actions.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to trigger the vulnerability.\n*   **Ability to Create Flows:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify network flows using the openvswitch module.\n*   **Crafted Actions:** They need to be able to craft network flows with a large number of actions to trigger the integer underflow condition.\n\n**Additional details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was found in the Linux Kernel's openvswitch module.\n*   The vulnerability is fixed by rearranging the flow action size check, as per the provided commit.\n*   The fix is included in Linux kernel version 5.18.\n*   Multiple Red Hat errata (RHSA, RHBA) have been released to address this vulnerability in different versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 192 | Integer Coercion Error | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.754 |\n| 2 | 190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.412 |\n| 3 | 191 | Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound) | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.393 |\n| 4 | 125 | Out-of-bounds Read | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.391 |\n| 5 | 193 | Off-by-one Error | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.391 |\n| 6 | 1245 | Improper Finite State Machines (FSMs) in Hardware Logic | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.518 |\n| 7 | 128 | Wrap-around Error | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 681 | Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.383 |\n| 9 | 1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.383 |\n| 10 | 787 | Out-of-bounds Write | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.381 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-192: Integer Coercion Error\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nInteger coercion refers to a set of flaws pertaining to the type casting, extension, or truncation of primitive data types.\n\n### Extended Description\nSeveral flaws fall under the category of integer coercion errors.

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called \"underflows\").\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\n\"Integer overflow\" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.\n\n\nA \"wraparound\" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.\n\n\n\"Overflow\" is sometimes conflated with \"wraparound\" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.\n\n\nThe \"overflow\" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use \"overflow\" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using \"underflow\" for exceeding the minimum.\n\n\nSome people use \"overflow\" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses \"underflow\" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.\n\n\nSee [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.\n\n\n**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis can happen in signed and unsigned cases.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nInteger underflow: \n\n\"Integer underflow\" is sometimes used to identify signedness errors in which an originally positive number becomes negative as a result of subtraction. However, there are cases of bad subtraction in which unsigned integers are involved, so it's not always a signedness issue.\n\n\n\"Integer underflow\" is occasionally used to describe array index errors in which the index is negative.\n\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-682\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2004-0816:** Integer underflow in firewall via malformed packet.\n- **CVE-2004-1002:** Integer underflow by packet with invalid length.\n- **CVE-2005-0199:** Long input causes incorrect length calculation.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOOB read: Shorthand for \"Out of bounds\" read\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-1018:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to read 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.\n- **CVE-2020-11899:** Out-of-bounds read in IP stack used in embedded systems, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: \"Heartbleed\" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\noff-by-five: An \"off-by-five\" error was reported for sudo in 2002 (CVE-2002-0184), but that is more like a \"length calculation\" error.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nCanPrecede -> CWE-617\nCanPrecede -> CWE-170\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is not always a buffer overflow. For example, an off-by-one error could be a factor in a partial comparison, a read from the wrong memory location, an incorrect conditional, etc.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2003-0252:** Off-by-one error allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via requests that do not contain newlines.\n- **CVE-2001-1391:** Off-by-one vulnerability in driver allows users to modify kernel memory.\n- **CVE-2002-0083:** Off-by-one error allows local users or remote malicious servers to gain privileges.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1245: Improper Finite State Machines (FSMs) in Hardware Logic\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nFaulty finite state machines (FSMs) in the hardware logic allow an attacker to put the system in an undefined state, to cause a denial of service (DoS) or gain privileges on the victim's system.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThe functionality and security of the system heavily depend on the implementation of FSMs. FSMs can be used to indicate the current security state of the system. Lots of secure data operations and data transfers rely on the state reported by the FSM. Faulty FSM designs that do not account for all states, either through undefined states (left as don't cares) or through incorrect implementation, might lead an attacker to drive the system into an unstable state from which the system cannot recover without a reset, thus causing a DoS. Depending on what the FSM is used for, an attacker might also gain additional privileges to launch further attacks and compromise the security guarantees.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-684\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

    "enhanced_query": "## Vulnerability Description\nAn **integer coercion error** was found in the openvswitch kernel module. Given a sufficiently large number of actions, while copying and reserving memory for a new action of a new flow, the reserve_sfa_size() function does not return -EMSGSIZE as expected, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds write access. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **integer coercion error**\n- **impact:** crash or potentially escalate privileges\n- **vector:** out-of-bounds write access\n- **attacker:** local user\n- **product:** openvswitch kernel module\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2639:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   An integer underflow vulnerability exists within the `reserve_sfa_size()` function in the openvswitch kernel module.\n*   The vulnerability occurs when calculating the required size for flow actions. Specifically, when `next_offset` is close to `MAX_ACTIONS_BUFSIZE` and a new action with `req_size` is added, instead of returning `-EMSGSIZE`, the code allocates `MAX_ACTIONS_BUFSIZE` bytes, incrementing `actions_len` by `req_size`. This leads to `actions_len` exceeding the allocated buffer size.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Integer Underflow:** The core issue is an incorrect check for sufficient buffer space before allocating memory for flow actions, which leads to an integer underflow and an out-of-bounds (OOB) write.\n*   **Out-of-Bounds Write:** The incorrect size calculation causes `reserve_sfa_size()` to allocate a larger buffer size than intended and when subsequent actions are copied, they are written past the end of the allocated memory.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Crash:** A local user can trigger the vulnerability, resulting in a system crash due to the out-of-bounds write.\n*   **Potential Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability may also allow a local user to potentially escalate their privileges due to memory corruption.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **Local User:** The attack vector is a local user interacting with the system and the openvswitch module.\n*   **Flow Actions:** Exploitation involves crafting a flow with a large number of actions, causing the `reserve_sfa_size()` function to miscalculate the memory requirements for the flow actions.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to trigger the vulnerability.\n*   **Ability to Create Flows:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify network flows using the openvswitch module.\n*   **Crafted Actions:** They need to be able to craft network flows with a large number of actions to trigger the integer underflow condition.\n\n**Additional details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was found in the Linux Kernel's openvswitch module.\n*   The vulnerability is fixed by rearranging the flow action size check, as per the provided commit.\n*   The fix is included in Linux kernel version 5.18.\n*   Multiple Red Hat errata (RHSA, RHBA) have been released to address this vulnerability in different versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 192 | Integer Coercion Error | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.754 |\n| 2 | 190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.412 |\n| 3 | 191 | Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound) | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.393 |\n| 4 | 125 | Out-of-bounds Read | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.391 |\n| 5 | 193 | Off-by-one Error | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.391 |\n| 6 | 1245 | Improper Finite State Machines (FSMs) in Hardware Logic | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.518 |\n| 7 | 128 | Wrap-around Error | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 681 | Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.383 |\n| 9 | 1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.383 |\n| 10 | 787 | Out-of-bounds Write | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.381 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-192: Integer Coercion Error\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nInteger coercion refers to a set of flaws pertaining to the type casting, extension, or truncation of primitive data types.\n\n### Extended Description\nSeveral flaws fall under the category of integer coercion errors.

Faulty FSM designs that do not account for all states, either through undefined states (left as don't cares) or through incorrect implementation, might lead an attacker to drive the system into an unstable state from which the system cannot recover without a reset, thus causing a DoS. Depending on what the FSM is used for, an attacker might also gain additional privileges to launch further attacks and compromise the security guarantees.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-684\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2007-4268:** Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nSpecified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-789\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
