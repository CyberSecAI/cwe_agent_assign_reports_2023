For example, after memory is de-allocated, an operating system may make the memory available to another process, or disk space may be reallocated when a file is deleted. As removing information requires time and additional resources, operating systems do not usually clear the previously written information.\n\n\nEven when the resource is reused by the same process, this weakness can arise when new data is not as large as the old data, which leaves portions of the old data still available. Equivalent errors can occur in other situations where the length of data is variable but the associated data structure is not. If memory is not cleared after use, the information may be read by less trustworthy parties when the memory is reallocated.\n\n\nThis weakness can apply in hardware, such as when a device or system switches between power, sleep, or debug states during normal operation, or when execution changes to different users or privilege levels.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-459\nChildOf -> CWE-212\nCanPrecede -> CWE-201\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).\n\n**[Maintenance]** This entry needs modification to clarify the differences with CWE-212. The description also combines two problems that are distinct from the CWE research perspective: the inadvertent transfer of information to another sphere, and improper initialization/shutdown. Some of the associated taxonomy mappings reflect these different uses.\n\n**[Research Gap]** This is frequently found for network packets, but it can also exist in local memory allocation, files, etc.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release\n- **CVE-2003-0001:** Ethernet NIC drivers do not pad frames with null bytes, leading to infoleak from malformed packets.\n- **CVE-2003-0291:** router does not clear information from DHCP packets that have been previously used\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-459: Incomplete Cleanup\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly \"clean up\" and remove temporary or supporting resources after they have been used.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nInsufficient Cleanup\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-404\nChildOf -> CWE-404\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** CWE-459 is a child of CWE-404 because, while CWE-404 covers any type of improper shutdown or release of a resource, CWE-459 deals specifically with a multi-step shutdown process in which a crucial step for \"proper\" cleanup is omitted or impossible. That is, CWE-459 deals specifically with a cleanup or shutdown process that does not successfully remove all potentially sensitive data.\n\n**[Relationship]** Overlaps other categories such as permissions and containment. Concept needs further development. This could be primary (e.g. leading to infoleak) or resultant (e.g. resulting from unhandled error conditions or early termination).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2000-0552:** World-readable temporary file not deleted after use.\n- **CVE-2005-2293:** Temporary file not deleted after use, leaking database usernames and passwords.\n- **CVE-2002-0788:** Interaction error creates a temporary file that can not be deleted due to strong permissions.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-209\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-202\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** Sensitive information could include data that is sensitive in and of itself (such as credentials or private messages), or otherwise useful in the further exploitation of the system (such as internal file system structure).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nResources that may contain sensitive data include documents, packets, messages, databases, etc. While this data may be useful to an individual user or small set of users who share the resource, it may need to be removed before the resource can be shared outside of the trusted group. The process of removal is sometimes called cleansing or scrubbing.\n\n\nFor example, a product for editing documents might not remove sensitive data such as reviewer comments or the local pathname where the document is stored. Or, a proxy might not remove an internal IP address from headers before making an outgoing request to an Internet site.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-669\nChildOf -> CWE-669\nCanPrecede -> CWE-201\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This entry is intended to be different from resultant information leaks, including those that occur from improper buffer initialization and reuse, improper encryption, interaction errors, and multiple interpretation errors. This entry could be regarded as a privacy leak, depending on the type of information that is leaked.\n\n**[Relationship]** There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).\n\n**[Terminology]** The terms \"cleansing\" and \"scrubbing\" have multiple uses within computing. In information security, these are used for the removal of sensitive data, but they are also used for the modification of incoming/outgoing data so that it conforms to specifications.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release\n- **CVE-2005-0406:** Some image editors modify a JPEG image, but the original EXIF thumbnail image is left intact within the JPEG. (Also an interaction error).\n- **CVE-2002-0704:** NAT feature in firewall leaks internal IP addresses in ICMP error messages.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry has some significant overlap with other CWE entries and may need some clarification. See terminology notes.\n\n**[Terminology]** The \"Origin Validation Error\" term was originally used in a 1995 thesis [REF-324]. Although not formally defined, an issue is considered to be an origin validation error if either (1) \"an object [accepts] input from an unauthorized subject,\" or (2) \"the system [fails] to properly or completely authenticate a subject.\" A later section says that an origin validation error can occur when the system (1) \"does not properly authenticate a user or process\" or (2) \"does not properly authenticate the shared data or libraries.\" The only example provided in the thesis (covered by OSVDB:57615) involves a setuid program running command-line arguments without dropping privileges. So, this definition (and its examples in the thesis) effectively cover other weaknesses such as CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), and CWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges). There appears to be little usage of this term today, except in the SecurityFocus vulnerability database, where the term is used for a variety of issues, including web-browser problems that allow violation of the Same Origin Policy and improper validation of the source of an incoming message.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2000-1218:** DNS server can accept DNS updates from hosts that it did not query, leading to cache poisoning\n- **CVE-2005-0877:** DNS server can accept DNS updates from hosts that it did not query, leading to cache poisoning\n- **CVE-2001-1452:** DNS server caches glue records received from non-delegated name servers\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-422: Unprotected Windows Messaging Channel ('Shatter')\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly verify the source of a message in the Windows Messaging System while running at elevated privileges, creating an alternate channel through which an attacker can directly send a message to the product.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-420\nChildOf -> CWE-360\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Overlaps privilege errors and UI errors.\n\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nPossibly under-reported, probably under-studied. It is suspected that a number of publicized vulnerabilities that involve local privilege escalation on Windows systems may be related to Shatter attacks, but they are not labeled as such.\n\n\nAlternate channel attacks likely exist in other operating systems and messaging models, e.g. in privileged X Windows applications, but examples are not readily available.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-0971:** Bypass GUI and access restricted dialog box.\n- **CVE-2002-1230:** Gain privileges via Windows message.\n- **CVE-2003-0350:** A control allows a change to a pointer for a callback function using Windows message.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nCode frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-400\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nChildOf -> CWE-400\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).\n\n**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. \"Resource exhaustion\" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..\n- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nTOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to \"Time Of Check To Time Of Use\".\nTOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-362\nChildOf -> CWE-362\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** TOCTOU issues do not always involve symlinks, and not every symlink issue is a TOCTOU problem.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Non-symlink TOCTOU issues are not reported frequently, but they are likely to occur in code that attempts to be secure.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2015-1743:** TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed\n- **CVE-2003-0813:** A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.\n- **CVE-2004-0594:** PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. This is often a component in phishing attacks.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nIf an attacker can cause the UI to display erroneous data, or to otherwise convince the user to display information that appears to come from a trusted source, then the attacker could trick the user into performing the wrong action. This is often a component in phishing attacks, but other kinds of problems exist. For example, if the UI is used to monitor the security state of a system or network, then omitting or obscuring an important indicator could prevent the user from detecting and reacting to a security-critical event.\n\n\nUI misrepresentation can take many forms:\n\n\n  - Incorrect indicator: incorrect information is displayed, which prevents the user from understanding the true state of the product or the environment the product is monitoring, especially of potentially-dangerous conditions or operations. This can be broken down into several different subtypes.\n\n  - Overlay: an area of the display is intended to give critical information, but another process can modify the display by overlaying another element on top of it. The user is not interacting with the expected portion of the user interface. This is the problem that enables clickjacking attacks, although many other types of attacks exist that involve overlay.\n\n  - Icon manipulation: the wrong icon, or the wrong color indicator, can be influenced (such as making a dangerous .EXE executable look like a harmless .GIF)\n\n  - Timing: the product is performing a state transition or context switch that is presented to the user with an indicator, but a race condition can cause the wrong indicator to be used before the product has fully switched context. The race window could be extended indefinitely if the attacker can trigger an error.\n\n  - Visual truncation: important information could be truncated from the display, such as a long filename with a dangerous extension that is not displayed in the GUI because the malicious portion is truncated. The use of excessive whitespace can also cause truncation, or place the potentially-dangerous indicator outside of the user's field of view (e.g. \"filename.txt .exe\"). A different type of truncation can occur when a portion of the information is removed due to reasons other than length, such as the accidental insertion of an end-of-input marker in the middle of an input, such as a NUL byte in a C-style string.\n\n  - Visual distinction: visual information might be presented in a way that makes it difficult for the user to quickly and correctly distinguish between critical and unimportant segments of the display.\n\n  - Homographs: letters from different character sets, fonts, or languages can appear very similar (i.e. may be visually equivalent) in a way that causes the human user to misread the text (for example, to conduct phishing attacks to trick a user into visiting a malicious web site with a visually-similar name as a trusted site). This can be regarded as a type of visual distinction issue.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-684\nChildOf -> CWE-221\nPeerOf -> CWE-346\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry should be broken down into more precise entries. See extended description.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Misrepresentation problems are frequently studied in web browsers, but there are no known efforts for classifying these kinds of problems in terms of the shortcomings of the interface. In addition, many misrepresentation issues are resultant.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2004-2227:** Web browser's filename selection dialog only shows the beginning portion of long filenames, which can trick users into launching executables with dangerous extensions.\n- **CVE-2001-0398:** Attachment with many spaces in filename bypasses \"dangerous content\" warning and uses different icon. Likely resultant.\n- **CVE-2001-0643:** Misrepresentation and equivalence issue.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Some of the associated taxonomy mappings reflect these different uses.\n\n**[Research Gap]** This is frequently found for network packets, but it can also exist in local memory allocation, files, etc.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release\n- **CVE-2003-0001:** Ethernet NIC drivers do not pad frames with null bytes, leading to infoleak from malformed packets.\n- **CVE-2003-0291:** router does not clear information from DHCP packets that have been previously used\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-459: Incomplete Cleanup\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly \"clean up\" and remove temporary or supporting resources after they have been used.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nInsufficient Cleanup\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-404\nChildOf -> CWE-404\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

That is, CWE-459 deals specifically with a cleanup or shutdown process that does not successfully remove all potentially sensitive data.\n\n**[Relationship]** Overlaps other categories such as permissions and containment. Concept needs further development. This could be primary (e.g. leading to infoleak) or resultant (e.g. resulting from unhandled error conditions or early termination).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2000-0552:** World-readable temporary file not deleted after use.\n- **CVE-2005-2293:** Temporary file not deleted after use, leaking database usernames and passwords.\n- **CVE-2002-0788:** Interaction error creates a temporary file that can not be deleted due to strong permissions.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-209\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-202\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

The process of removal is sometimes called cleansing or scrubbing.\n\n\nFor example, a product for editing documents might not remove sensitive data such as reviewer comments or the local pathname where the document is stored. Or, a proxy might not remove an internal IP address from headers before making an outgoing request to an Internet site.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-669\nChildOf -> CWE-669\nCanPrecede -> CWE-201\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This entry could be regarded as a privacy leak, depending on the type of information that is leaked.\n\n**[Relationship]** There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).\n\n**[Terminology]** The terms \"cleansing\" and \"scrubbing\" have multiple uses within computing. In information security, these are used for the removal of sensitive data, but they are also used for the modification of incoming/outgoing data so that it conforms to specifications.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release\n- **CVE-2005-0406:** Some image editors modify a JPEG image, but the original EXIF thumbnail image is left intact within the JPEG. (Also an interaction error).\n- **CVE-2002-0704:** NAT feature in firewall leaks internal IP addresses in ICMP error messages.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry has some significant overlap with other CWE entries and may need some clarification. See terminology notes.\n\n**[Terminology]** The \"Origin Validation Error\" term was originally used in a 1995 thesis [REF-324]. Although not formally defined, an issue is considered to be an origin validation error if either (1) \"an object [accepts] input from an unauthorized subject,\" or (2) \"the system [fails] to properly or completely authenticate a subject.\" A later section says that an origin validation error can occur when the system (1) \"does not properly authenticate a user or process\" or (2) \"does not properly authenticate the shared data or libraries.\" The only example provided in the thesis (covered by OSVDB:57615) involves a setuid program running command-line arguments without dropping privileges. So, this definition (and its examples in the thesis) effectively cover other weaknesses such as CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), and CWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges). There appears to be little usage of this term today, except in the SecurityFocus vulnerability database, where the term is used for a variety of issues, including web-browser problems that allow violation of the Same Origin Policy and improper validation of the source of an incoming message.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2000-1218:** DNS server can accept DNS updates from hosts that it did not query, leading to cache poisoning\n- **CVE-2005-0877:** DNS server can accept DNS updates from hosts that it did not query, leading to cache poisoning\n- **CVE-2001-1452:** DNS server caches glue records received from non-delegated name servers\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-422: Unprotected Windows Messaging Channel ('Shatter')\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly verify the source of a message in the Windows Messaging System while running at elevated privileges, creating an alternate channel through which an attacker can directly send a message to the product.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-420\nChildOf -> CWE-360\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Overlaps privilege errors and UI errors.\n\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nPossibly under-reported, probably under-studied. It is suspected that a number of publicized vulnerabilities that involve local privilege escalation on Windows systems may be related to Shatter attacks, but they are not labeled as such.\n\n\nAlternate channel attacks likely exist in other operating systems and messaging models, e.g. in privileged X Windows applications, but examples are not readily available.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-0971:** Bypass GUI and access restricted dialog box.\n- **CVE-2002-1230:** Gain privileges via Windows message.\n- **CVE-2003-0350:** A control allows a change to a pointer for a callback function using Windows message.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nCode frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-400\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nChildOf -> CWE-400\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).\n\n**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. \"Resource exhaustion\" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..\n- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nTOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to \"Time Of Check To Time Of Use\".\nTOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-362\nChildOf -> CWE-362\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** TOCTOU issues do not always involve symlinks, and not every symlink issue is a TOCTOU problem.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Non-symlink TOCTOU issues are not reported frequently, but they are likely to occur in code that attempts to be secure.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2015-1743:** TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed\n- **CVE-2003-0813:** A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.\n- **CVE-2004-0594:** PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. This is often a component in phishing attacks.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nIf an attacker can cause the UI to display erroneous data, or to otherwise convince the user to display information that appears to come from a trusted source, then the attacker could trick the user into performing the wrong action. This is often a component in phishing attacks, but other kinds of problems exist. For example, if the UI is used to monitor the security state of a system or network, then omitting or obscuring an important indicator could prevent the user from detecting and reacting to a security-critical event.\n\n\nUI misrepresentation can take many forms:\n\n\n  - Incorrect indicator: incorrect information is displayed, which prevents the user from understanding the true state of the product or the environment the product is monitoring, especially of potentially-dangerous conditions or operations. This can be broken down into several different subtypes.\n\n  - Overlay: an area of the display is intended to give critical information, but another process can modify the display by overlaying another element on top of it. The user is not interacting with the expected portion of the user interface. This is the problem that enables clickjacking attacks, although many other types of attacks exist that involve overlay.\n\n  - Icon manipulation: the wrong icon, or the wrong color indicator, can be influenced (such as making a dangerous .EXE executable look like a harmless .GIF)\n\n  - Timing: the product is performing a state transition or context switch that is presented to the user with an indicator, but a race condition can cause the wrong indicator to be used before the product has fully switched context. The race window could be extended indefinitely if the attacker can trigger an error.\n\n  - Visual truncation: important information could be truncated from the display, such as a long filename with a dangerous extension that is not displayed in the GUI because the malicious portion is truncated. The use of excessive whitespace can also cause truncation, or place the potentially-dangerous indicator outside of the user's field of view (e.g. \"filename.txt .exe\"). A different type of truncation can occur when a portion of the information is removed due to reasons other than length, such as the accidental insertion of an end-of-input marker in the middle of an input, such as a NUL byte in a C-style string.\n\n  - Visual distinction: visual information might be presented in a way that makes it difficult for the user to quickly and correctly distinguish between critical and unimportant segments of the display.\n\n  - Homographs: letters from different character sets, fonts, or languages can appear very similar (i.e. may be visually equivalent) in a way that causes the human user to misread the text (for example, to conduct phishing attacks to trick a user into visiting a malicious web site with a visually-similar name as a trusted site). This can be regarded as a type of visual distinction issue.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-684\nChildOf -> CWE-221\nPeerOf -> CWE-346\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry should be broken down into more precise entries. See extended description.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Misrepresentation problems are frequently studied in web browsers, but there are no known efforts for classifying these kinds of problems in terms of the shortcomings of the interface. In addition, many misrepresentation issues are resultant.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2004-2227:** Web browser's filename selection dialog only shows the beginning portion of long filenames, which can trick users into launching executables with dangerous extensions.\n- **CVE-2001-0398:** Attachment with many spaces in filename bypasses \"dangerous content\" warning and uses different icon. Likely resultant.\n- **CVE-2001-0643:** Misrepresentation and equivalence issue.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

For example, after memory is de-allocated, an operating system may make the memory available to another process, or disk space may be reallocated when a file is deleted. As removing information requires time and additional resources, operating systems do not usually clear the previously written information.\n\n\nEven when the resource is reused by the same process, this weakness can arise when new data is not as large as the old data, which leaves portions of the old data still available. Equivalent errors can occur in other situations where the length of data is variable but the associated data structure is not. If memory is not cleared after use, the information may be read by less trustworthy parties when the memory is reallocated.\n\n\nThis weakness can apply in hardware, such as when a device or system switches between power, sleep, or debug states during normal operation, or when execution changes to different users or privilege levels.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-459\nChildOf -> CWE-212\nCanPrecede -> CWE-201\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).\n\n**[Terminology]** The terms \"cleansing\" and \"scrubbing\" have multiple uses within computing. In information security, these are used for the removal of sensitive data, but they are also used for the modification of incoming/outgoing data so that it conforms to specifications.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release\n- **CVE-2005-0406:** Some image editors modify a JPEG image, but the original EXIF thumbnail image is left intact within the JPEG. (Also an interaction error).\n- **CVE-2002-0704:** NAT feature in firewall leaks internal IP addresses in ICMP error messages.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry has some significant overlap with other CWE entries and may need some clarification. See terminology notes.\n\n**[Terminology]** The \"Origin Validation Error\" term was originally used in a 1995 thesis [REF-324]. Although not formally defined, an issue is considered to be an origin validation error if either (1) \"an object [accepts] input from an unauthorized subject,\" or (2) \"the system [fails] to properly or completely authenticate a subject.\" A later section says that an origin validation error can occur when the system (1) \"does not properly authenticate a user or process\" or (2) \"does not properly authenticate the shared data or libraries.\" The only example provided in the thesis (covered by OSVDB:57615) involves a setuid program running command-line arguments without dropping privileges. So, this definition (and its examples in the thesis) effectively cover other weaknesses such as CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), and CWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges). There appears to be little usage of this term today, except in the SecurityFocus vulnerability database, where the term is used for a variety of issues, including web-browser problems that allow violation of the Same Origin Policy and improper validation of the source of an incoming message.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2000-1218:** DNS server can accept DNS updates from hosts that it did not query, leading to cache poisoning\n- **CVE-2005-0877:** DNS server can accept DNS updates from hosts that it did not query, leading to cache poisoning\n- **CVE-2001-1452:** DNS server caches glue records received from non-delegated name servers\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-422: Unprotected Windows Messaging Channel ('Shatter')\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly verify the source of a message in the Windows Messaging System while running at elevated privileges, creating an alternate channel through which an attacker can directly send a message to the product.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-420\nChildOf -> CWE-360\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Overlaps privilege errors and UI errors.\n\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nPossibly under-reported, probably under-studied. It is suspected that a number of publicized vulnerabilities that involve local privilege escalation on Windows systems may be related to Shatter attacks, but they are not labeled as such.\n\n\nAlternate channel attacks likely exist in other operating systems and messaging models, e.g. in privileged X Windows applications, but examples are not readily available.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-0971:** Bypass GUI and access restricted dialog box.\n- **CVE-2002-1230:** Gain privileges via Windows message.\n- **CVE-2003-0350:** A control allows a change to a pointer for a callback function using Windows message.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nCode frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-400\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nChildOf -> CWE-400\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).\n\n**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. \"Resource exhaustion\" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..\n- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nTOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to \"Time Of Check To Time Of Use\".\nTOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-362\nChildOf -> CWE-362\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** TOCTOU issues do not always involve symlinks, and not every symlink issue is a TOCTOU problem.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Non-symlink TOCTOU issues are not reported frequently, but they are likely to occur in code that attempts to be secure.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2015-1743:** TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed\n- **CVE-2003-0813:** A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.\n- **CVE-2004-0594:** PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. This is often a component in phishing attacks.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nIf an attacker can cause the UI to display erroneous data, or to otherwise convince the user to display information that appears to come from a trusted source, then the attacker could trick the user into performing the wrong action. This is often a component in phishing attacks, but other kinds of problems exist. For example, if the UI is used to monitor the security state of a system or network, then omitting or obscuring an important indicator could prevent the user from detecting and reacting to a security-critical event.\n\n\nUI misrepresentation can take many forms:\n\n\n  - Incorrect indicator: incorrect information is displayed, which prevents the user from understanding the true state of the product or the environment the product is monitoring, especially of potentially-dangerous conditions or operations. This can be broken down into several different subtypes.\n\n  - Overlay: an area of the display is intended to give critical information, but another process can modify the display by overlaying another element on top of it. The user is not interacting with the expected portion of the user interface. This is the problem that enables clickjacking attacks, although many other types of attacks exist that involve overlay.\n\n  - Icon manipulation: the wrong icon, or the wrong color indicator, can be influenced (such as making a dangerous .EXE executable look like a harmless .GIF)\n\n  - Timing: the product is performing a state transition or context switch that is presented to the user with an indicator, but a race condition can cause the wrong indicator to be used before the product has fully switched context. The race window could be extended indefinitely if the attacker can trigger an error.\n\n  - Visual truncation: important information could be truncated from the display, such as a long filename with a dangerous extension that is not displayed in the GUI because the malicious portion is truncated. The use of excessive whitespace can also cause truncation, or place the potentially-dangerous indicator outside of the user's field of view (e.g. \"filename.txt .exe\"). A different type of truncation can occur when a portion of the information is removed due to reasons other than length, such as the accidental insertion of an end-of-input marker in the middle of an input, such as a NUL byte in a C-style string.\n\n  - Visual distinction: visual information might be presented in a way that makes it difficult for the user to quickly and correctly distinguish between critical and unimportant segments of the display.\n\n  - Homographs: letters from different character sets, fonts, or languages can appear very similar (i.e. may be visually equivalent) in a way that causes the human user to misread the text (for example, to conduct phishing attacks to trick a user into visiting a malicious web site with a visually-similar name as a trusted site). This can be regarded as a type of visual distinction issue.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-684\nChildOf -> CWE-221\nPeerOf -> CWE-346\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry should be broken down into more precise entries. See extended description.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Misrepresentation problems are frequently studied in web browsers, but there are no known efforts for classifying these kinds of problems in terms of the shortcomings of the interface. In addition, many misrepresentation issues are resultant.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2004-2227:** Web browser's filename selection dialog only shows the beginning portion of long filenames, which can trick users into launching executables with dangerous extensions.\n- **CVE-2001-0398:** Attachment with many spaces in filename bypasses \"dangerous content\" warning and uses different icon. Likely resultant.\n- **CVE-2001-0643:** Misrepresentation and equivalence issue.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-31260:** Chain: a digital asset management program has an undisclosed backdoor in the legacy version of a PHP script (CWE-912) that could allow an unauthenticated user to export metadata (CWE-306)\n- **CVE-2022-29951:** TCP-based protocol in Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) has no authentication.\n- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.\n\n Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-807 CWE-451 CWE-668 CWE-770 CWE-212 CWE-226 CWE-367 CWE-404",
