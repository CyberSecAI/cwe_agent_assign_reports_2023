An attacker can craft a TFLite model that would cause an **integer overflow** in embedding lookup operations. Both `embedding_size` and `lookup_size` are products of values provided by the user. Hence, a malicious user could trigger overflows in the multiplication. In certain scenarios, this can then result in **heap OOB read/write**.
