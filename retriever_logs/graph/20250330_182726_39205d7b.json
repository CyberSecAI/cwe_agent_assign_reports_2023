The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker. Some kinds of sensitive information include:\n\n\n  - private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details\n\n  - system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages\n\n  - business secrets and intellectual property\n\n  - network status and configuration\n\n  - the product's own code or internal state\n\n  - metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers\n\n  - indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider\n\nInformation might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected. These parties include:\n\n  - the product's own users\n\n  - people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users\n\n  - the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates\n\n  - the developer\n\nInformation exposures can occur in different ways:\n\n  - the code  **explicitly inserts**  sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been \"scrubbed\" or \"sanitized\"\n\n  - a different weakness or mistake  **indirectly inserts**  the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.\n\n  - the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are  **unintentionally made accessible**  to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.\n\nIt is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read. CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store, transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nInformation Disclosure: This term is frequently used in vulnerability advisories to describe a consequence or technical impact, for any vulnerability that has a loss of confidentiality. Often, CWE-200 can be misused to represent the loss of confidentiality, even when the mistake - i.e., the weakness - is not directly related to the mishandling of the information itself, such as an out-of-bounds read that accesses sensitive memory contents; here, the out-of-bounds read is the primary weakness, not the disclosure of the memory. In addition, this phrase is also used frequently in policies and legal documents, but it does not refer to any disclosure of security-relevant information.\nInformation Leak: This is a frequently used term, however the \"leak\" term has multiple uses within security. In some cases it deals with the accidental exposure of information from a different weakness, but in other cases (such as \"memory leak\"), this deals with improper tracking of resources, which can lead to exhaustion. As a result, CWE is actively avoiding usage of the \"leak\" term.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].\n**Comments:** If an error or mistake causes information to be disclosed, then use the CWE ID for that error. Consider starting with improper authorization (CWE-285), insecure permissions (CWE-732), improper authentication (CWE-287), etc. Also consider children such as Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data (CWE-201), Observable Discrepancy (CWE-203), Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory (CWE-538), or others.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** As a result of mapping analysis in the 2020 Top 25 and more recent versions, this weakness is under review, since it is frequently misused in mapping to cover many problems that lead to loss of confidentiality. See Mapping Notes, Extended Description, and Alternate Terms.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-31162:** Rust library leaks Oauth client details in application debug logs\n- **CVE-2021-25476:** Digital Rights Management (DRM) capability for mobile platform leaks pointer information, simplifying ASLR bypass\n- **CVE-2001-1483:** Enumeration of valid usernames based on inconsistent responses\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThe sensitive information may be valuable information on its own (such as a password), or it may be useful for launching other, more serious attacks. The error message may be created in different ways:\n\n\n  - self-generated: the source code explicitly constructs the error message and delivers it\n\n  - externally-generated: the external environment, such as a language interpreter, handles the error and constructs its own message, whose contents are not under direct control by the programmer\n\nAn attacker may use the contents of error messages to help launch another, more focused attack. For example, an attempt to exploit a path traversal weakness (CWE-22) might yield the full pathname of the installed application. In turn, this could be used to select the proper number of \"..\" sequences to navigate to the targeted file. An attack using SQL injection (CWE-89) might not initially succeed, but an error message could reveal the malformed query, which would expose query logic and possibly even passwords or other sensitive information used within the query.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nChildOf -> CWE-755\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2008-2049:** POP3 server reveals a password in an error message after multiple APOP commands are sent. Might be resultant from another weakness.\n- **CVE-2007-5172:** Program reveals password in error message if attacker can trigger certain database errors.\n- **CVE-2008-4638:** Composite: application running with high privileges (CWE-250) allows user to specify a restricted file to process, which generates a parsing error that leaks the contents of the file (CWE-209).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-209\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-202\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** Sensitive information could include data that is sensitive in and of itself (such as credentials or private messages), or otherwise useful in the further exploitation of the system (such as internal file system structure).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nRetrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.\n\n\nFor example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.\n\n\nOne manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nInsecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The \"Insecure Direct Object Reference\" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.\nBroken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.\nHorizontal Authorization: \"Horizontal Authorization\" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-863\nChildOf -> CWE-863\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAttackers may be able to bypass weak authentication faster and/or with less effort than expected.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).\n- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication\n- **CVE-2021-3116:** Chain: Python-based HTTP Proxy server uses the wrong boolean operators (CWE-480) causing an incorrect comparison (CWE-697) that identifies an authN failure if all three conditions are met instead of only one, allowing bypass of the proxy authentication (CWE-1390)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-549: Missing Password Field Masking\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not mask passwords during entry, increasing the potential for attackers to observe and capture passwords.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-522\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

    "enhanced_query": "## Vulnerability Description\nGrafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. When using the forget password on the login page, a POST request is made to the `/api/user/password/sent-reset-email` URL. When the username or email does not exist, a JSON response contains a user not found message. This leaks information to unauthenticated users and introduces a security risk. This issue has been patched in 9.2.4 and backported to 8.5.15. There are no known workarounds.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **weakness:** **information leak**\n- **attacker:** unauthenticated users\n- **product:** Grafana\n- **version:** before 9.2.4 and 8.5.15\n- **component:** forget password feature\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-39307:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the way Grafana handles password reset requests. When a user attempts to reset their password, a POST request is sent to `/api/user/password/sent-reset-email`. The server's response to this request reveals whether the provided username or email exists within the system, specifically by returning a \"user not found\" message if the user does not exist.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **User Enumeration:** The primary weakness is the ability to enumerate valid usernames/emails by observing the server's response to password reset attempts. This is a form of information disclosure.\n- **Information Leakage:** The server's response leaks information to unauthenticated users.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially use this vulnerability to compile a list of valid usernames/emails, which can then be used in subsequent attacks such as brute-force password attacks or targeted phishing campaigns.\n- **Security Risk:** The information leakage exposes the system to potential unauthorized access or information gathering.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or access to the system.\n- **Network access:** Attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable Grafana instance.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- **Affected Versions:** Grafana versions prior to 9.2.4 and 8.5.15 are affected. Specifically, versions >=9.0.0 and <9.2.4, and any version before 8.5.15 are vulnerable.\n- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 5.3 (Medium), and a CVSS v4 score of 7.3 (High).\n- **Remediation:** The vulnerability is fixed in Grafana versions 9.2.4 and 8.5.15. Users should upgrade to these versions or later.\n- **NetApp Products:** NetApp E-Series Performance Analyzer is listed as an affected product.\n\nThis analysis is based on the provided content and provides a detailed description of the vulnerability.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | Class | Discouraged | alternate_terms | 1.000 |\n| 2 | 209 | Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.576 |\n| 3 | 201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.505 |\n| 4 | 639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.471 |\n| 5 | 1390 | Weak Authentication | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.470 |\n| 6 | 549 | Missing Password Field Masking | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.468 |\n| 7 | 756 | Missing Custom Error Page | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.462 |\n| 9 | 306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.449 |\n| 10 | 204 | Observable Response Discrepancy | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.443 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThere are many different kinds of mistakes that introduce information exposures. The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker. Some kinds of sensitive information include:\n\n\n  - private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details\n\n  - system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages\n\n  - business secrets and intellectual property\n\n  - network status and configuration\n\n  - the product's own code or internal state\n\n  - metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers\n\n  - indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider\n\nInformation might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected. These parties include:\n\n  - the product's own users\n\n  - people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users\n\n  - the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates\n\n  - the developer\n\nInformation exposures can occur in different ways:\n\n  - the code  **explicitly inserts**  sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been \"scrubbed\" or \"sanitized\"\n\n  - a different weakness or mistake  **indirectly inserts**  the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.\n\n  - the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are  **unintentionally made accessible**  to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.\n\nIt is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read. CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store, transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nInformation Disclosure: This term is frequently used in vulnerability advisories to describe a consequence or technical impact, for any vulnerability that has a loss of confidentiality. Often, CWE-200 can be misused to represent the loss of confidentiality, even when the mistake - i.e., the weakness - is not directly related to the mishandling of the information itself, such as an out-of-bounds read that accesses sensitive memory contents; here, the out-of-bounds read is the primary weakness, not the disclosure of the memory. In addition, this phrase is also used frequently in policies and legal documents, but it does not refer to any disclosure of security-relevant information.\nInformation Leak: This is a frequently used term, however the \"leak\" term has multiple uses within security. In some cases it deals with the accidental exposure of information from a different weakness, but in other cases (such as \"memory leak\"), this deals with improper tracking of resources, which can lead to exhaustion. As a result, CWE is actively avoiding usage of the \"leak\" term.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.

It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.\n- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default \"Allow\" configuration for its authorization settings.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-31260:** Chain: a digital asset management program has an undisclosed backdoor in the legacy version of a PHP script (CWE-912) that could allow an unauthenticated user to export metadata (CWE-306)\n- **CVE-2022-29951:** TCP-based protocol in Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) has no authentication.\n- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis issue frequently occurs during authentication, where a difference in failed-login messages could allow an attacker to determine if the username is valid or not. These exposures can be inadvertent (bug) or intentional (design).\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-203\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
