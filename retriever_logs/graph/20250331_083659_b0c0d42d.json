It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information\n- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.\n- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-782: Exposed IOCTL with Insufficient Access Control\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product implements an IOCTL with functionality that should be restricted, but it does not properly enforce access control for the IOCTL.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen an IOCTL contains privileged functionality and is exposed unnecessarily, attackers may be able to access this functionality by invoking the IOCTL. Even if the functionality is benign, if the programmer has assumed that the IOCTL would only be accessed by a trusted process, there may be little or no validation of the incoming data, exposing weaknesses that would never be reachable if the attacker cannot call the IOCTL directly.\n\n\nThe implementations of IOCTLs will differ between operating system types and versions, so the methods of attack and prevention may vary widely.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-749\nCanPrecede -> CWE-781\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This can be primary to many other weaknesses when the programmer assumes that the IOCTL can only be accessed by trusted parties. For example, a program or driver might not validate incoming addresses in METHOD_NEITHER IOCTLs in Windows environments (CWE-781), which could allow buffer overflow and similar attacks to take place, even when the attacker never should have been able to access the IOCTL at all.\n\n**[Applicable Platform]** \n\nBecause IOCTL functionality is typically performing low-level actions and closely interacts with the operating system, this weakness may only appear in code that is written in low-level languages.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2009-2208:** Operating system does not enforce permissions on an IOCTL that can be used to modify network settings.\n- **CVE-2008-3831:** Device driver does not restrict ioctl calls to its direct rendering manager.\n- **CVE-2008-3525:** ioctl does not check for a required capability before processing certain requests.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nShell injection\nShell metacharacters\nOS Command Injection\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-88\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** The \"OS command injection\" phrase carries different meanings to different people. For some people, it only refers to cases in which the attacker injects command separators into arguments for an application-controlled program that is being invoked. For some people, it refers to any type of attack that can allow the attacker to execute OS commands of their own choosing. This usage could include untrusted search path weaknesses (CWE-426) that cause the application to find and execute an attacker-controlled program. Further complicating the issue is the case when argument injection (CWE-88) allows alternate command-line switches or options to be inserted into the command line, such as an \"-exec\" switch whose purpose may be to execute the subsequent argument as a command (this -exec switch exists in the UNIX \"find\" command, for example). In this latter case, however, CWE-88 could be regarded as the primary weakness in a chain with CWE-78.\n\n**[Research Gap]** More investigation is needed into the distinction between the OS command injection variants, including the role with argument injection (CWE-88). Equivalent distinctions may exist in other injection-related problems such as SQL injection.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-10987:** OS command injection in Wi-Fi router, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-10221:** Template functionality in network configuration management tool allows OS command injection, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-9054:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in username parameter, leading to OS command injection (CWE-78), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-269 is commonly misused. It can be conflated with \"privilege escalation,\" which is a technical impact that is listed in many low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis.\n**Comments:** If an error or mistake allows privilege escalation, then use the CWE ID for that mistake. Avoid using CWE-269 when only phrases such as \"privilege escalation\" or \"gain privileges\" are available, as these indicate technical impact of the vulnerability - not the root cause weakness. If the root cause seems to be directly related to privileges, then examine the children of CWE-269 for additional hints, such as Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250) or Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266).\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-1555:** Terminal privileges are not reset when a user logs out.\n- **CVE-2001-1514:** Does not properly pass security context to child processes in certain cases, allows privilege escalation.\n- **CVE-2001-0128:** Does not properly compute roles.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nIf a web product does not properly protect assumed-immutable values from modification in hidden form fields, parameters, cookies, or URLs, this can lead to modification of critical data. Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.\n\n\nFor example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAssumed-Immutable Parameter Tampering\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-642\nChildOf -> CWE-471\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is a primary weakness for many other weaknesses and functional consequences, including XSS, SQL injection, path disclosure, and file inclusion.\n\n**[Theoretical]** This is a technology-specific MAID problem.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-0108:** Forum product allows spoofed messages of other users via hidden form fields for name and e-mail address.\n- **CVE-2000-0253:** Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.\n- **CVE-2000-0254:** Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDirectory traversal\nPath traversal: \"Path traversal\" is preferred over \"directory traversal,\" but both terms are attack-focused.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add \".txt\" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.\n\n**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.\n\n**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing \"/\" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nLike other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use \"directory traversal\" only to refer to the injection of \"..\" and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.\n\n\nOther variants like \"absolute pathname\" and \"drive letter\" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve \"..\" or equivalent.\n\n\n**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.\n\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nIncomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that \"..\\\" is vulnerable, but not test \"../\" which may also be vulnerable.\n\n\nAny combination of directory separators (\"/\", \"\\\", etc.) and numbers of \".\" (e.g. \"....\") can produce unique variants; for example, the \"//../\" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a.

It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information\n- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.\n- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-782: Exposed IOCTL with Insufficient Access Control\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product implements an IOCTL with functionality that should be restricted, but it does not properly enforce access control for the IOCTL.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen an IOCTL contains privileged functionality and is exposed unnecessarily, attackers may be able to access this functionality by invoking the IOCTL. Even if the functionality is benign, if the programmer has assumed that the IOCTL would only be accessed by a trusted process, there may be little or no validation of the incoming data, exposing weaknesses that would never be reachable if the attacker cannot call the IOCTL directly.\n\n\nThe implementations of IOCTLs will differ between operating system types and versions, so the methods of attack and prevention may vary widely.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-749\nCanPrecede -> CWE-781\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This can be primary to many other weaknesses when the programmer assumes that the IOCTL can only be accessed by trusted parties. For example, a program or driver might not validate incoming addresses in METHOD_NEITHER IOCTLs in Windows environments (CWE-781), which could allow buffer overflow and similar attacks to take place, even when the attacker never should have been able to access the IOCTL at all.\n\n**[Applicable Platform]** \n\nBecause IOCTL functionality is typically performing low-level actions and closely interacts with the operating system, this weakness may only appear in code that is written in low-level languages.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2009-2208:** Operating system does not enforce permissions on an IOCTL that can be used to modify network settings.\n- **CVE-2008-3831:** Device driver does not restrict ioctl calls to its direct rendering manager.\n- **CVE-2008-3525:** ioctl does not check for a required capability before processing certain requests.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nShell injection\nShell metacharacters\nOS Command Injection\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-88\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** The \"OS command injection\" phrase carries different meanings to different people. For some people, it only refers to cases in which the attacker injects command separators into arguments for an application-controlled program that is being invoked. For some people, it refers to any type of attack that can allow the attacker to execute OS commands of their own choosing. This usage could include untrusted search path weaknesses (CWE-426) that cause the application to find and execute an attacker-controlled program. Further complicating the issue is the case when argument injection (CWE-88) allows alternate command-line switches or options to be inserted into the command line, such as an \"-exec\" switch whose purpose may be to execute the subsequent argument as a command (this -exec switch exists in the UNIX \"find\" command, for example). In this latter case, however, CWE-88 could be regarded as the primary weakness in a chain with CWE-78.\n\n**[Research Gap]** More investigation is needed into the distinction between the OS command injection variants, including the role with argument injection (CWE-88). Equivalent distinctions may exist in other injection-related problems such as SQL injection.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-10987:** OS command injection in Wi-Fi router, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-10221:** Template functionality in network configuration management tool allows OS command injection, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-9054:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in username parameter, leading to OS command injection (CWE-78), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-269 is commonly misused. It can be conflated with \"privilege escalation,\" which is a technical impact that is listed in many low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis.\n**Comments:** If an error or mistake allows privilege escalation, then use the CWE ID for that mistake. Avoid using CWE-269 when only phrases such as \"privilege escalation\" or \"gain privileges\" are available, as these indicate technical impact of the vulnerability - not the root cause weakness. If the root cause seems to be directly related to privileges, then examine the children of CWE-269 for additional hints, such as Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250) or Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266).\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-1555:** Terminal privileges are not reset when a user logs out.\n- **CVE-2001-1514:** Does not properly pass security context to child processes in certain cases, allows privilege escalation.\n- **CVE-2001-0128:** Does not properly compute roles.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nIf a web product does not properly protect assumed-immutable values from modification in hidden form fields, parameters, cookies, or URLs, this can lead to modification of critical data. Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.\n\n\nFor example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAssumed-Immutable Parameter Tampering\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-642\nChildOf -> CWE-471\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is a primary weakness for many other weaknesses and functional consequences, including XSS, SQL injection, path disclosure, and file inclusion.\n\n**[Theoretical]** This is a technology-specific MAID problem.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-0108:** Forum product allows spoofed messages of other users via hidden form fields for name and e-mail address.\n- **CVE-2000-0253:** Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.\n- **CVE-2000-0254:** Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDirectory traversal\nPath traversal: \"Path traversal\" is preferred over \"directory traversal,\" but both terms are attack-focused.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add \".txt\" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.\n\n**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.\n\n**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing \"/\" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nLike other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use \"directory traversal\" only to refer to the injection of \"..\" and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.\n\n\nOther variants like \"absolute pathname\" and \"drive letter\" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve \"..\" or equivalent.\n\n\n**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.\n\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nIncomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that \"..\\\" is vulnerable, but not test \"../\" which may also be vulnerable.\n\n\nAny combination of directory separators (\"/\", \"\\\", etc.) and numbers of \".\" (e.g. \"....\") can produce unique variants; for example, the \"//../\" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a.

It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information\n- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.\n- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-782: Exposed IOCTL with Insufficient Access Control\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product implements an IOCTL with functionality that should be restricted, but it does not properly enforce access control for the IOCTL.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen an IOCTL contains privileged functionality and is exposed unnecessarily, attackers may be able to access this functionality by invoking the IOCTL. Even if the functionality is benign, if the programmer has assumed that the IOCTL would only be accessed by a trusted process, there may be little or no validation of the incoming data, exposing weaknesses that would never be reachable if the attacker cannot call the IOCTL directly.\n\n\nThe implementations of IOCTLs will differ between operating system types and versions, so the methods of attack and prevention may vary widely.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-749\nCanPrecede -> CWE-781\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This can be primary to many other weaknesses when the programmer assumes that the IOCTL can only be accessed by trusted parties. For example, a program or driver might not validate incoming addresses in METHOD_NEITHER IOCTLs in Windows environments (CWE-781), which could allow buffer overflow and similar attacks to take place, even when the attacker never should have been able to access the IOCTL at all.\n\n**[Applicable Platform]** \n\nBecause IOCTL functionality is typically performing low-level actions and closely interacts with the operating system, this weakness may only appear in code that is written in low-level languages.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2009-2208:** Operating system does not enforce permissions on an IOCTL that can be used to modify network settings.\n- **CVE-2008-3831:** Device driver does not restrict ioctl calls to its direct rendering manager.\n- **CVE-2008-3525:** ioctl does not check for a required capability before processing certain requests.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nShell injection\nShell metacharacters\nOS Command Injection\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-88\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** The \"OS command injection\" phrase carries different meanings to different people. For some people, it only refers to cases in which the attacker injects command separators into arguments for an application-controlled program that is being invoked. For some people, it refers to any type of attack that can allow the attacker to execute OS commands of their own choosing. This usage could include untrusted search path weaknesses (CWE-426) that cause the application to find and execute an attacker-controlled program. Further complicating the issue is the case when argument injection (CWE-88) allows alternate command-line switches or options to be inserted into the command line, such as an \"-exec\" switch whose purpose may be to execute the subsequent argument as a command (this -exec switch exists in the UNIX \"find\" command, for example). In this latter case, however, CWE-88 could be regarded as the primary weakness in a chain with CWE-78.\n\n**[Research Gap]** More investigation is needed into the distinction between the OS command injection variants, including the role with argument injection (CWE-88). Equivalent distinctions may exist in other injection-related problems such as SQL injection.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-10987:** OS command injection in Wi-Fi router, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-10221:** Template functionality in network configuration management tool allows OS command injection, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-9054:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in username parameter, leading to OS command injection (CWE-78), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-269 is commonly misused. It can be conflated with \"privilege escalation,\" which is a technical impact that is listed in many low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis.\n**Comments:** If an error or mistake allows privilege escalation, then use the CWE ID for that mistake. Avoid using CWE-269 when only phrases such as \"privilege escalation\" or \"gain privileges\" are available, as these indicate technical impact of the vulnerability - not the root cause weakness. If the root cause seems to be directly related to privileges, then examine the children of CWE-269 for additional hints, such as Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250) or Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266).\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-1555:** Terminal privileges are not reset when a user logs out.\n- **CVE-2001-1514:** Does not properly pass security context to child processes in certain cases, allows privilege escalation.\n- **CVE-2001-0128:** Does not properly compute roles.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nIf a web product does not properly protect assumed-immutable values from modification in hidden form fields, parameters, cookies, or URLs, this can lead to modification of critical data. Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.\n\n\nFor example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAssumed-Immutable Parameter Tampering\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-642\nChildOf -> CWE-471\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is a primary weakness for many other weaknesses and functional consequences, including XSS, SQL injection, path disclosure, and file inclusion.\n\n**[Theoretical]** This is a technology-specific MAID problem.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-0108:** Forum product allows spoofed messages of other users via hidden form fields for name and e-mail address.\n- **CVE-2000-0253:** Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.\n- **CVE-2000-0254:** Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDirectory traversal\nPath traversal: \"Path traversal\" is preferred over \"directory traversal,\" but both terms are attack-focused.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add \".txt\" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.\n\n**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.\n\n**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing \"/\" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nLike other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use \"directory traversal\" only to refer to the injection of \"..\" and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.\n\n\nOther variants like \"absolute pathname\" and \"drive letter\" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve \"..\" or equivalent.\n\n\n**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.\n\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nIncomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that \"..\\\" is vulnerable, but not test \"../\" which may also be vulnerable.\n\n\nAny combination of directory separators (\"/\", \"\\\", etc.) and numbers of \".\" (e.g. \"....\") can produce unique variants; for example, the \"//../\" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a.
