This causes the `sp` pointer to write past the allocated memory on the stack leading to a stack buffer overflow.\n*   **Incorrect memory allocation:** The initial report mentioned a heap buffer overflow, but the final analysis and fix identified the issue as stack overflow because `sp` points to the stack memory.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Crash:** The primary impact is a program crash due to the stack buffer overflow when the `sp` pointer goes out of bounds.\n*   **Potential for further exploitation:** While the provided information focuses on a crash, a stack buffer overflow can be further exploited in certain circumstances to achieve code execution.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Malicious GIF File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted GIF file. In the provided example, the crafted html file contains a malicious GIF file.\n*   **Command-line Execution:** The vulnerability can be triggered by using the `htmldoc` tool in command line as shown in the example `htmldoc --webpage -f out.pdf ./crash.html` which includes the crafted html and gif files.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious GIF file as input to `htmldoc` to trigger the vulnerability.\n*   The attacker has to be able to execute the vulnerable program with the crafted file as input.\n\n**Additional details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was identified by user `Voiddy-Dev`.\n*   A patch was quickly implemented by `michaelrsweet`, the maintainer of `htmldoc`, and was committed on the same day the issue was reported.\n*   The fix was included in the version 1.9.15 of the `htmldoc` package.\n*   The Fedora update advisory FEDORA-2022-39533c087f addresses this CVE by providing an updated htmldoc package.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 835 | Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.354 |\n| 2 | 122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.247 |\n| 3 | 190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.246 |\n| 4 | 457 | Use of Uninitialized Variable | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.241 |\n| 5 | 415 | Double Free | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.239 |\n| 6 | 127 | Buffer Under-read | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.534 |\n| 7 | 128 | Wrap-around Error | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 197 | Numeric Truncation Error | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.239 |\n| 9 | 1339 | Insufficient Precision or Accuracy of a Real Number | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.239 |\n| 10 | 674 | Uncontrolled Recursion | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.238 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product contains an iteration or loop with an exit condition that cannot be reached, i.e., an infinite loop.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-834\nChildOf -> CWE-834\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may\n         become a very small or negative number.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOverflow: The terms \"overflow\" and \"wraparound\" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.\nWraparound: The terms \"overflow\" and \"wraparound\" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.\nwrap, wrap-around, wrap around: Alternate spellings of \"wraparound\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with \"overflow,\" \"underflow,\" and \"wraparound\" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called \"underflows\").\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\n\"Integer overflow\" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.\n\n\nA \"wraparound\" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.\n\n\n\"Overflow\" is sometimes conflated with \"wraparound\" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.\n\n\nThe \"overflow\" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use \"overflow\" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using \"underflow\" for exceeding the minimum.\n\n\nSome people use \"overflow\" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses \"underflow\" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.\n\n\nSee [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.\n\n\n**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe code uses a variable that has not been initialized, leading to unpredictable or unintended results.\n\n### Extended Description\nIn some languages such as C and C++, stack variables are not initialized by default. They generally contain junk data with the contents of stack memory before the function was invoked. An attacker can sometimes control or read these contents. In other languages or conditions, a variable that is not explicitly initialized can be given a default value that has security implications, depending on the logic of the program. The presence of an uninitialized variable can sometimes indicate a typographic error in the code.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-908\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nChildOf -> CWE-665\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n- **CVE-2008-3688:** Chain: A denial of service may be caused by an uninitialized variable (CWE-457) allowing an infinite loop (CWE-835) resulting from a connection to an unresponsive server.\n- **CVE-2008-0081:** Uninitialized variable leads to code execution in popular desktop application.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-415: Double Free\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a program calls free() twice with the same argument, the program's memory management data structures become corrupted. This corruption can cause the program to crash or, in some circumstances, cause two later calls to malloc() to return the same pointer. If malloc() returns the same value twice and the program later gives the attacker control over the data that is written into this doubly-allocated memory, the program becomes vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDouble-free\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-825\nChildOf -> CWE-1341\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-666\nPeerOf -> CWE-416\nPeerOf -> CWE-123\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is usually resultant from another weakness, such as an unhandled error or race condition between threads. It could also be primary to weaknesses such as buffer overflows.\n\n**[Theoretical]** It could be argued that Double Free would be most appropriately located as a child of \"Use after Free\", but \"Use\" and \"Release\" are considered to be distinct operations within vulnerability theory, therefore this is more accurately \"Release of a Resource after Expiration or Release\", which doesn't exist yet.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2006-5051:** Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\n- **CVE-2004-0642:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n- **CVE-2004-0772:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-127: Buffer Under-read\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations prior to the targeted buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis typically occurs when the pointer or its index is decremented to a position before the buffer, when pointer arithmetic results in a position before the beginning of the valid memory location, or when a negative index is used. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-125\nChildOf -> CWE-786\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Research Gap]** Under-studied.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-40985:** HTML conversion package has a buffer under-read, allowing a crash\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-128: Wrap-around Error\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nWrap around errors occur whenever a value is incremented past the maximum value for its type and therefore \"wraps around\" to a very small, negative, or undefined value.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\nPeerOf -> CWE-190\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** The relationship between overflow and wrap-around needs to be examined more closely, since several entries (including CWE-190) are closely related.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a primitive is cast to a smaller primitive, the high order bits of the large value are lost in the conversion, potentially resulting in an unexpected value that is not equal to the original value. This value may be required as an index into a buffer, a loop iterator, or simply necessary state data. In any case, the value cannot be trusted and the system will be in an undefined state. While this method may be employed viably to isolate the low bits of a value, this usage is rare, and truncation usually implies that an implementation error has occurred.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-681\nChildOf -> CWE-681\nChildOf -> CWE-681\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-195\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-196\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-192\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-194\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Research Gap]** This weakness has traditionally been under-studied and under-reported, although vulnerabilities in popular software have been published in 2008 and 2009.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-17087:** Chain: integer truncation (CWE-197) causes small buffer allocation (CWE-131) leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) in kernel pool, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2009-0231:** Integer truncation of length value leads to heap-based buffer overflow.\n- **CVE-2008-3282:** Size of a particular type changes for 64-bit platforms, leading to an integer truncation in document processor causes incorrect index to be generated.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1339: Insufficient Precision or Accuracy of a Real Number\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product processes a real number with an implementation in which the number's representation does not preserve required accuracy and precision in its fractional part, causing an incorrect result.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen a security decision or calculation requires highly precise, accurate numbers such as financial calculations or prices, then small variations in the number could be exploited by an attacker. \n\n\nThere are multiple ways to store the fractional part of a real number in a computer. In all of these cases, there is a limit to the accuracy of recording a fraction. If the fraction can be represented in a fixed number of digits (binary or decimal), there might not be enough digits assigned to represent the number. In other cases the number cannot be represented in a fixed number of digits due to repeating in decimal or binary notation (e.g. 0.333333...) or due to a transcendental number such as \u03a0 or \u221a2. Rounding of numbers can lead to situations where the computer results do not adequately match the result of sufficiently accurate math. \n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nPeerOf -> CWE-190\nCanPrecede -> CWE-834\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This corruption can cause the program to crash or, in some circumstances, cause two later calls to malloc() to return the same pointer.

It could also be primary to weaknesses such as buffer overflows.\n\n**[Theoretical]** It could be argued that Double Free would be most appropriately located as a child of \"Use after Free\", but \"Use\" and \"Release\" are considered to be distinct operations within vulnerability theory, therefore this is more accurately \"Release of a Resource after Expiration or Release\", which doesn't exist yet.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2006-5051:** Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\n- **CVE-2004-0642:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n- **CVE-2004-0772:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-127: Buffer Under-read\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations prior to the targeted buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis typically occurs when the pointer or its index is decremented to a position before the buffer, when pointer arithmetic results in a position before the beginning of the valid memory location, or when a negative index is used. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-125\nChildOf -> CWE-786\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This value may be required as an index into a buffer, a loop iterator, or simply necessary state data. In any case, the value cannot be trusted and the system will be in an undefined state. While this method may be employed viably to isolate the low bits of a value, this usage is rare, and truncation usually implies that an implementation error has occurred.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-681\nChildOf -> CWE-681\nChildOf -> CWE-681\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-195\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-196\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-192\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-194\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

In all of these cases, there is a limit to the accuracy of recording a fraction. If the fraction can be represented in a fixed number of digits (binary or decimal), there might not be enough digits assigned to represent the number. In other cases the number cannot be represented in a fixed number of digits due to repeating in decimal or binary notation (e.g. 0.333333...) or due to a transcendental number such as \u03a0 or \u221a2. Rounding of numbers can lead to situations where the computer results do not adequately match the result of sufficiently accurate math. \n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nPeerOf -> CWE-190\nCanPrecede -> CWE-834\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This causes the `sp` pointer to write past the allocated memory on the stack leading to a stack buffer overflow.\n*   **Incorrect memory allocation:** The initial report mentioned a heap buffer overflow, but the final analysis and fix identified the issue as stack overflow because `sp` points to the stack memory.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Crash:** The primary impact is a program crash due to the stack buffer overflow when the `sp` pointer goes out of bounds.\n*   **Potential for further exploitation:** While the provided information focuses on a crash, a stack buffer overflow can be further exploited in certain circumstances to achieve code execution.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Malicious GIF File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted GIF file. In the provided example, the crafted html file contains a malicious GIF file.\n*   **Command-line Execution:** The vulnerability can be triggered by using the `htmldoc` tool in command line as shown in the example `htmldoc --webpage -f out.pdf ./crash.html` which includes the crafted html and gif files.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious GIF file as input to `htmldoc` to trigger the vulnerability.\n*   The attacker has to be able to execute the vulnerable program with the crafted file as input.\n\n**Additional details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was identified by user `Voiddy-Dev`.\n*   A patch was quickly implemented by `michaelrsweet`, the maintainer of `htmldoc`, and was committed on the same day the issue was reported.\n*   The fix was included in the version 1.9.15 of the `htmldoc` package.\n*   The Fedora update advisory FEDORA-2022-39533c087f addresses this CVE by providing an updated htmldoc package.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 835 | Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.354 |\n| 2 | 122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.247 |\n| 3 | 190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.246 |\n| 4 | 457 | Use of Uninitialized Variable | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.241 |\n| 5 | 415 | Double Free | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.239 |\n| 6 | 127 | Buffer Under-read | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.534 |\n| 7 | 128 | Wrap-around Error | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 197 | Numeric Truncation Error | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.239 |\n| 9 | 1339 | Insufficient Precision or Accuracy of a Real Number | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.239 |\n| 10 | 674 | Uncontrolled Recursion | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.238 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product contains an iteration or loop with an exit condition that cannot be reached, i.e., an infinite loop.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-834\nChildOf -> CWE-834\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

In other languages or conditions, a variable that is not explicitly initialized can be given a default value that has security implications, depending on the logic of the program. The presence of an uninitialized variable can sometimes indicate a typographic error in the code.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-908\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nChildOf -> CWE-665\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n- **CVE-2008-3688:** Chain: A denial of service may be caused by an uninitialized variable (CWE-457) allowing an infinite loop (CWE-835) resulting from a connection to an unresponsive server.\n- **CVE-2008-0081:** Uninitialized variable leads to code execution in popular desktop application.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-415: Double Free\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a program calls free() twice with the same argument, the program's memory management data structures become corrupted. This corruption can cause the program to crash or, in some circumstances, cause two later calls to malloc() to return the same pointer. If malloc() returns the same value twice and the program later gives the attacker control over the data that is written into this doubly-allocated memory, the program becomes vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDouble-free\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-825\nChildOf -> CWE-1341\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-666\nPeerOf -> CWE-416\nPeerOf -> CWE-123\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is usually resultant from another weakness, such as an unhandled error or race condition between threads. It could also be primary to weaknesses such as buffer overflows.\n\n**[Theoretical]** It could be argued that Double Free would be most appropriately located as a child of \"Use after Free\", but \"Use\" and \"Release\" are considered to be distinct operations within vulnerability theory, therefore this is more accurately \"Release of a Resource after Expiration or Release\", which doesn't exist yet.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2006-5051:** Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\n- **CVE-2004-0642:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n- **CVE-2004-0772:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-127: Buffer Under-read\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations prior to the targeted buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis typically occurs when the pointer or its index is decremented to a position before the buffer, when pointer arithmetic results in a position before the beginning of the valid memory location, or when a negative index is used. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-125\nChildOf -> CWE-786\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Research Gap]** Under-studied.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-40985:** HTML conversion package has a buffer under-read, allowing a crash\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-128: Wrap-around Error\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nWrap around errors occur whenever a value is incremented past the maximum value for its type and therefore \"wraps around\" to a very small, negative, or undefined value.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\nPeerOf -> CWE-190\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** The relationship between overflow and wrap-around needs to be examined more closely, since several entries (including CWE-190) are closely related.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a primitive is cast to a smaller primitive, the high order bits of the large value are lost in the conversion, potentially resulting in an unexpected value that is not equal to the original value. This value may be required as an index into a buffer, a loop iterator, or simply necessary state data. In any case, the value cannot be trusted and the system will be in an undefined state. While this method may be employed viably to isolate the low bits of a value, this usage is rare, and truncation usually implies that an implementation error has occurred.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-681\nChildOf -> CWE-681\nChildOf -> CWE-681\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-195\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-196\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-192\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-194\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Research Gap]** This weakness has traditionally been under-studied and under-reported, although vulnerabilities in popular software have been published in 2008 and 2009.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-17087:** Chain: integer truncation (CWE-197) causes small buffer allocation (CWE-131) leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) in kernel pool, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2009-0231:** Integer truncation of length value leads to heap-based buffer overflow.\n- **CVE-2008-3282:** Size of a particular type changes for 64-bit platforms, leading to an integer truncation in document processor causes incorrect index to be generated.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1339: Insufficient Precision or Accuracy of a Real Number\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product processes a real number with an implementation in which the number's representation does not preserve required accuracy and precision in its fractional part, causing an incorrect result.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen a security decision or calculation requires highly precise, accurate numbers such as financial calculations or prices, then small variations in the number could be exploited by an attacker. \n\n\nThere are multiple ways to store the fractional part of a real number in a computer. In all of these cases, there is a limit to the accuracy of recording a fraction. If the fraction can be represented in a fixed number of digits (binary or decimal), there might not be enough digits assigned to represent the number. In other cases the number cannot be represented in a fixed number of digits due to repeating in decimal or binary notation (e.g. 0.333333...) or due to a transcendental number such as \u03a0 or \u221a2. Rounding of numbers can lead to situations where the computer results do not adequately match the result of sufficiently accurate math. \n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nPeerOf -> CWE-190\nCanPrecede -> CWE-834\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
