NOTE the vendor does not consider this a vulnerability because the report is only about use of certificates at the application layer (not the transport layer) and Certificates are exchanged in a controlled fashion between entities within a trust relationship. This is why self-signed certificates may be used and why validating certificates isnt as important as doing so for the transport layer certificates.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **missing SSL certificate validation**\n- **product:** ComponentSpace.Saml2\n- **version:** 4.4.0\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis related to potential vulnerabilities, focusing on the release notes for ComponentSpace SAML for ASP.NET Core:\n\n**Vulnerability Information:**\n\nThe provided release notes document fixes and improvements in the ComponentSpace SAML for ASP.NET Core library. While not directly describing CVE-specific vulnerabilities, they highlight areas where potential security issues have been addressed. Here's a breakdown of the relevant fixes:\n\n*   **5.2.0 \u2013 November 27, 2024:**\n    *   **Check the protocol binding in the authn request is valid:** This addresses a potential vulnerability where an attacker might manipulate the protocol binding in an authentication request to bypass security checks or cause unexpected behavior.\n    *   **Check the logout request validity time:** This fixes a potential issue where a logout request might be replayed if not validated for its validity period, potentially allowing an attacker to log out legitimate users.\n    *   **Check the SAML assertion subject confirmation data validity time:**  This addresses a potential vulnerability where an attacker could replay old SAML assertions if the validity time of the subject confirmation data isn't verified, leading to unauthorized access.\n\n*   **4.9.0 \u2013 September 7, 2023:**\n    *   **Validate certificates before signature verification:** This addresses a vulnerability where an expired certificate with the same public key as an active certificate could be used to bypass signature verification, potentially allowing an attacker to forge SAML messages.\n\n*   **4.7.0 \u2013 March 15, 2023:**\n     * **Default the configuration flags `SignLogoutRequest`, `SignLogoutResponse`, `WantLogoutRequestSigned` and `WantLogoutResponseSigned` to true:** This enforces that logout messages are signed, protecting against tampering and replay attacks.\n     * **Default the configuration flag `SignAssertion` to true:** This enforces that SAML assertions are signed, ensuring integrity.\n     * **Default the configuration flags `SignAuthnRequest` and `WantAuthnRequestSigned` to true:** This enforces that authentication requests are signed, ensuring integrity and authenticity of requests.\n\n*   **4.6.0 \u2013 January 12, 2023:**\n    *   **When verifying signatures, only check the validity of the certificate used for the verification:** This addresses a vulnerability where expired or revoked certificates could be used if the validity checks were not specific to the certificate used for signature verification.\n   *   **When generating signatures, use a valid (ie non-expired) certificate:** This ensures that signatures generated are valid to prevent issues related to expired certificates.\n\n*   **4.5.0 \u2013 November 17, 2022:**\n    *   **Support multiple pending SAML responses within the one browser session:** This addresses a potential vulnerability where handling of concurrent SAML responses was inadequate, which might lead to incorrect processing of responses and potential security bypasses.\n\n*   **4.4.0 \u2013 September 7, 2022:**\n    *   **Use the System.Security.Cryptography.Xml update that addresses Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2022-34716:** This explicitly addresses the CVE-2022-34716, indicating a dependency on a fix for a known vulnerability in XML security handling.\n\n*   **2.9.0 \u2013 March 20, 2020:**\n    *   **Validate decrypted SAML assertions against the SAML XML schemas:** This addresses a potential vulnerability where improperly formatted SAML assertions, if not validated, could lead to unexpected behavior or security bypasses.\n    *   **Tighten up the InResponseTo checking:** This enhances security by ensuring that SAML responses are correctly matched to the corresponding requests.\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**\n\nThe root causes vary but broadly relate to:\n\n*   **Lack of proper validation:** Insufficient validation of SAML message elements like validity times, protocol bindings, and signatures.\n*   **Inadequate certificate handling:** Issues related to expired certificates, and not validating the correct certificate for signature verification.\n*   **Improper handling of concurrent requests:** Vulnerabilities arising from not handling concurrent SAML requests and responses correctly.\n*   **Reliance on defaults:** Not enforcing security defaults such as signing assertions, and relying on developers to configure them.\n*   **Dependency on vulnerable libraries:** Directly referencing and not updating libraries with known vulnerabilities such as CVE-2022-34716.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **SAML Message Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially manipulate SAML messages (authentication and logout requests, assertions) if not properly validated or signed.\n*   **Replay Attacks:**  Old, valid SAML messages could be replayed if validity times are not enforced.\n*   **Signature Forgery:**  Weaknesses in certificate handling or signature verification could allow attackers to forge SAML messages.\n*   **XML vulnerabilities:** Vulnerable XML handling could lead to exploits such as XXE.\n*   **Session Management Issues:**  Improper session management could lead to session hijacking or other related issues.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers might gain unauthorized access to systems or resources.\n*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers could potentially log out legitimate users.\n*   **Data Breach:** Tampered SAML assertions could lead to unauthorized modification or disclosure of data.\n*   **System Instability:** Improperly formatted SAML messages could lead to system errors or unexpected behaviors.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** Attackers could intercept and modify SAML messages in transit.\n*   **Replay Attacks:** Replaying previously captured SAML messages.\n*   **Malicious SAML Messages:** Crafting malicious SAML messages designed to exploit vulnerabilities.\n*   **Compromised Certificates:** Using expired or otherwise compromised certificates to bypass security checks.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** Attackers would typically need to be able to intercept or manipulate network traffic related to SAML exchanges.\n*   **Knowledge of SAML:** Attackers need to have a reasonable knowledge of the SAML protocol to craft malicious messages.\n*   **Compromised Credentials:** In some cases, attackers may need to have some form of compromised credentials or access to a certificate to initiate certain attacks.\n*   **Ability to intercept or modify SAML messages:** Either through a MitM position or by controlling part of the communication channel.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe release notes of ComponentSpace SAML for ASP.NET Core highlight a proactive approach to identifying and fixing potential security issues. The fixes generally involve stricter validation, improved certificate handling, and addressing specific vulnerabilities in underlying libraries. This information is valuable for understanding the security concerns related to SAML implementations and the importance of keeping libraries up to date.\n\n**Note:**\n\nThis analysis does not indicate any specific vulnerability with a CVE assigned, however based on the fixes described it indicates that there were vulnerabilities that could be exploited before the fixes were implemented.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 295 | Improper Certificate Validation | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.713 |\n| 2 | 296 | Improper Following of a Certificate's Chain of Trust | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.449 |\n| 3 | 345 | Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.433 |\n| 4 | 299 | Improper Check for Certificate Revocation | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.406 |\n| 5 | 297 | Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.386 |\n| 6 | 599 | Missing Validation of OpenSSL Certificate | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.519 |\n| 7 | 370 | Missing Check for Certificate Revocation after Initial Check | Variant | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 1007 | Insufficient Visual Distinction of Homoglyphs Presented to User | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.376 |\n| 9 | 1240 | Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.376 |\n| 10 | 319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.372 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by interfering in the communication path between the host and client. The product might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the product might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nPeerOf -> CWE-322\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-12496:** A Go framework for robotics, drones, and IoT devices skips verification of root CA certificates by default.\n- **CVE-2014-1266:** chain: incorrect \"goto\" in Apple SSL product bypasses certificate validation, allowing Adversary-in-the-Middle (AITM) attack (Apple \"goto fail\" bug). CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).\n- **CVE-2021-22909:** Chain: router's firmware update procedure uses curl with \"-k\" (insecure) option that disables certificate validation (CWE-295), allowing adversary-in-the-middle (AITM) compromise with a malicious firmware image (CWE-494).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-296: Improper Following of a Certificate's Chain of Trust\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not follow, or incorrectly follows, the chain of trust for a certificate back to a trusted root certificate, resulting in incorrect trust of any resource that is associated with that certificate.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nIf a system does not follow the chain of trust of a certificate to a root server, the certificate loses all usefulness as a metric of trust. Essentially, the trust gained from a certificate is derived from a chain of trust -- with a reputable trusted entity at the end of that list. The end user must trust that reputable source, and this reputable source must vouch for the resource in question through the medium of the certificate.\n\n\nIn some cases, this trust traverses several entities who vouch for one another. The entity trusted by the end user is at one end of this trust chain, while the certificate-wielding resource is at the other end of the chain. If the user receives a certificate at the end of one of these trust chains and then proceeds to check only that the first link in the chain, no real trust has been derived, since the entire chain must be traversed back to a trusted source to verify the certificate.\n\n\nThere are several ways in which the chain of trust might be broken, including but not limited to:\n\n\n  - Any certificate in the chain is self-signed, unless it the root.\n\n  - Not every intermediate certificate is checked, starting from the original certificate all the way up to the root certificate.\n\n  - An intermediate, CA-signed certificate does not have the expected Basic Constraints or other important extensions.\n\n  - The root certificate has been compromised or authorized to the wrong party.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-295\nChildOf -> CWE-573\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2016-2402:** Server allows bypass of certificate pinning by sending a chain of trust that includes a trusted CA that is not pinned.\n- **CVE-2008-4989:** Verification function trusts certificate chains in which the last certificate is self-signed.\n- **CVE-2012-5821:** Chain: Web browser uses a TLS-related function incorrectly, preventing it from verifying that a server's certificate is signed by a trusted certification authority (CA).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-693\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \"origin validation\" could fall under this.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The specific ways in which the origin is not properly identified should be laid out as separate weaknesses. In some sense, this is more like a category.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30260:** Distributed Control System (DCS) does not sign firmware images and only relies on insecure checksums for integrity checks\n- **CVE-2022-30267:** Distributed Control System (DCS) does not sign firmware images and only relies on insecure checksums for integrity checks\n- **CVE-2022-30272:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) does not use signatures for firmware images and relies on insecure checksums\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-299: Improper Check for Certificate Revocation\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks the revocation status of a certificate, which may cause it to use a certificate that has been compromised.\n\n### Extended Description\nAn improper check for certificate revocation is a far more serious flaw than related certificate failures. This is because the use of any revoked certificate is almost certainly malicious. The most common reason for certificate revocation is compromise of the system in question, with the result that no legitimate servers will be using a revoked certificate, unless they are sorely out of sync.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-295\nChildOf -> CWE-404\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2011-2014:** LDAP-over-SSL implementation does not check Certificate Revocation List (CRL), allowing spoofing using a revoked certificate.\n- **CVE-2011-0199:** Operating system does not check Certificate Revocation List (CRL) in some cases, allowing spoofing using a revoked certificate.\n- **CVE-2010-5185:** Antivirus product does not check whether certificates from signed executables have been revoked.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product communicates with a host that provides a certificate, but the product does not properly ensure that the certificate is actually associated with that host.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nEven if a certificate is well-formed, signed, and follows the chain of trust, it may simply be a valid certificate for a different site than the site that the product is interacting with. If the certificate's host-specific data is not properly checked - such as the Common Name (CN) in the Subject or the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension of an X.509 certificate - it may be possible for a redirection or spoofing attack to allow a malicious host with a valid certificate to provide data, impersonating a trusted host. In order to ensure data integrity, the certificate must be valid and it must pertain to the site that is being accessed.\n\n\nEven if the product attempts to check the hostname, it is still possible to incorrectly check the hostname. For example, attackers could create a certificate with a name that begins with a trusted name followed by a NUL byte, which could cause some string-based comparisons to only examine the portion that contains the trusted name.\n\n\nThis weakness can occur even when the product uses Certificate Pinning, if the product does not verify the hostname at the time a certificate is pinned.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-923\nChildOf -> CWE-295\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2012-5810:** Mobile banking application does not verify hostname, leading to financial loss.\n- **CVE-2012-5811:** Mobile application for printing documents does not verify hostname, allowing attackers to read sensitive documents.\n- **CVE-2012-5807:** Software for electronic checking does not verify hostname, leading to financial loss.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-599: Missing Validation of OpenSSL Certificate\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses OpenSSL and trusts or uses a certificate without using the SSL_get_verify_result() function to ensure that the certificate satisfies all necessary security requirements.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis could allow an attacker to use an invalid certificate to claim to be a trusted host, use expired certificates, or conduct other attacks that could be detected if the certificate is properly validated.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-295\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** CWE-295 and CWE-599 are very similar, although CWE-599 has a more narrow scope that is only applied to OpenSSL certificates. As a result, other children of CWE-295 can be regarded as children of CWE-599 as well. CWE's use of one-dimensional hierarchical relationships is not well-suited to handle different kinds of abstraction relationships based on concepts like types of resources (\"OpenSSL certificate\" as a child of \"any certificate\") and types of behaviors (\"not validating expiration\" as a child of \"improper validation\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-370: Missing Check for Certificate Revocation after Initial Check\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not check the revocation status of a certificate after its initial revocation check, which can cause the product to perform privileged actions even after the certificate is revoked at a later time.\n\n### Extended Description\nIf the revocation status of a certificate is not checked before each action that requires privileges, the system may be subject to a race condition. If a certificate is revoked after the initial check, all subsequent actions taken with the owner of the revoked certificate will lose all benefits guaranteed by the certificate. In fact, it is almost certain that the use of a revoked certificate indicates malicious activity.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-299\nPeerOf -> CWE-296\nPeerOf -> CWE-297\nPeerOf -> CWE-298\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1007: Insufficient Visual Distinction of Homoglyphs Presented to User\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product displays information or identifiers to a user, but the display mechanism does not make it easy for the user to distinguish between visually similar or identical glyphs (homoglyphs), which may cause the user to misinterpret a glyph and perform an unintended, insecure action.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nSome glyphs, pictures, or icons can be semantically distinct to a program, while appearing very similar or identical to a human user. These are referred to as homoglyphs. For example, the lowercase \"l\" (ell) and uppercase \"I\" (eye) have different character codes, but these characters can be displayed in exactly the same way to a user, depending on the font. This can also occur between different character sets. For example, the Latin capital letter \"A\" and the Greek capital letter \"\u0391\" (Alpha) are treated as distinct by programs, but may be displayed in exactly the same way to a user. Accent marks may also cause letters to appear very similar, such as the Latin capital letter grave mark \"\u00c0\" and its equivalent \"\u00c1\" with the acute accent.\n\n\nAdversaries can exploit this visual similarity for attacks such as phishing, e.g. by providing a link to an attacker-controlled hostname that looks like a hostname that the victim trusts. In a different use of homoglyphs, an adversary may create a back door username that is visually similar to the username of a regular user, which then makes it more difficult for a system administrator to detect the malicious username while reviewing logs.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nHomograph Attack: \"Homograph\" is often used as a synonym of \"homoglyph\" by researchers, but according to Wikipedia, a homograph is a word that has multiple, distinct meanings.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-451\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Some common examples of primitives are digital signatures, one-way hash functions, ciphers, and public key cryptography; however, the notion of \"primitive\" can vary depending on point of view. See \"Terminology Notes\" for further explanation of some concepts.\n\n\nCryptographic primitives are defined to accomplish one very specific task in a precisely defined and mathematically reliable fashion. For example, suppose that for a specific cryptographic primitive (such as an encryption routine), the consensus is that the primitive can only be broken after trying out N different inputs (where the larger the value of N, the stronger the cryptography). For an encryption scheme like AES-256, one would expect N to be so large as to be infeasible to execute in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n\nIf a vulnerability is ever found that shows that one can break a cryptographic primitive in significantly less than the expected number of attempts, then that primitive is considered weakened (or sometimes in extreme cases, colloquially it is \"broken\"). As a result, anything using this cryptographic primitive would now be considered insecure or risky. Thus, even breaking or weakening a seemingly small cryptographic primitive has the potential to render the whole system vulnerable, due to its reliance on the primitive. A historical example can be found in TLS when using DES. One would colloquially call DES the cryptographic primitive for transport encryption in this version of TLS. In the past, DES was considered strong, because no weaknesses were found in it; importantly, DES has a key length of 56 bits. Trying N=2^56 keys was considered impractical for most actors. Unfortunately, attacking a system with 56-bit keys is now practical via brute force, which makes defeating DES encryption practical. It is now practical for an adversary to read any information sent under this version of TLS and use this information to attack the system. As a result, it can be claimed that this use of TLS is weak, and that any system depending on TLS with DES could potentially render the entire system vulnerable to attack.\n\n\nCryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are only considered safe after extensive research and review from experienced cryptographers from academia, industry, and government entities looking for any possible flaws. Furthermore, cryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are frequently reevaluated for safety when new mathematical and attack techniques are discovered. As a result and over time, even well-known cryptographic primitives can lose their compliance status with the discovery of novel attacks that might either defeat the algorithm or reduce its robustness significantly.\n\n\nIf ad-hoc cryptographic primitives are implemented, it is almost certain that the implementation will be vulnerable to attacks that are well understood by cryptographers, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information and other consequences.\n\n\nThis weakness is even more difficult to manage for hardware-implemented deployment of cryptographic algorithms. First, because hardware is not patchable as easily as software, any flaw discovered after release and production typically cannot be fixed without a recall of the product. Secondly, the hardware product is often expected to work for years, during which time computation power available to the attacker only increases. Therefore, for hardware implementations of cryptographic primitives, it is absolutely essential that only strong, proven cryptographic primitives are used.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-327\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\n Terminology for cryptography varies widely, from informal and colloquial to mathematically-defined, with different precision and formalism depending on whether the stakeholder is a developer, cryptologist, etc. Yet there is a need for CWE to be self-consistent while remaining understandable and acceptable to multiple audiences.\n\n\nAs of CWE 4.6, CWE terminology around \"primitives\" and \"algorithms\" is emerging as shown by the following example, subject to future consultation and agreement within the CWE and cryptography communities. Suppose one wishes to send encrypted data using a CLI tool such as OpenSSL. One might choose to use AES with a 256-bit key and require tamper protection (GCM mode, for instance). For compatibility's sake, one might also choose the ciphertext to be formatted to the PKCS#5 standard. In this case, the \"cryptographic system\" would be AES-256-GCM with PKCS#5 formatting. The \"cryptographic function\" would be AES-256 in the GCM mode of operation, and the \"algorithm\" would be AES. Colloquially, one would say that AES (and sometimes AES-256) is the \"cryptographic primitive,\" because it is the algorithm that realizes the concept of symmetric encryption (without modes of operation or other protocol related modifications). In practice, developers and architects typically refer to base cryptographic algorithms (AES, SHA, etc.) as cryptographic primitives.\n\n\n**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-4778:** software uses MD5, which is less safe than the default SHA-256 used by related products\n- **CVE-2005-2946:** Default configuration of product uses MD5 instead of stronger algorithms that are available, simplifying forgery of certificates.\n- **CVE-2019-3907:** identity card uses MD5 hash of a salt and password\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany communication channels can be \"sniffed\" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.\n\n\nApplicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging.

    "original_query": "## Vulnerability Description\nComponentSpace.Saml2 4.4.0 Missing SSL Certificate Validation. NOTE the vendor does not consider this a vulnerability because the report is only about use of certificates at the application layer (not the transport layer) and Certificates are exchanged in a controlled fashion between entities within a trust relationship. This is why self-signed certificates may be used and why validating certificates isnt as important as doing so for the transport layer certificates.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **missing SSL certificate validation**\n- **product:** ComponentSpace.Saml2\n- **version:** 4.4.0\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis related to potential vulnerabilities, focusing on the release notes for ComponentSpace SAML for ASP.NET Core:\n\n**Vulnerability Information:**\n\nThe provided release notes document fixes and improvements in the ComponentSpace SAML for ASP.NET Core library. While not directly describing CVE-specific vulnerabilities, they highlight areas where potential security issues have been addressed. Here's a breakdown of the relevant fixes:\n\n*   **5.2.0 \u2013 November 27, 2024:**\n    *   **Check the protocol binding in the authn request is valid:** This addresses a potential vulnerability where an attacker might manipulate the protocol binding in an authentication request to bypass security checks or cause unexpected behavior.\n    *   **Check the logout request validity time:** This fixes a potential issue where a logout request might be replayed if not validated for its validity period, potentially allowing an attacker to log out legitimate users.\n    *   **Check the SAML assertion subject confirmation data validity time:**  This addresses a potential vulnerability where an attacker could replay old SAML assertions if the validity time of the subject confirmation data isn't verified, leading to unauthorized access.\n\n*   **4.9.0 \u2013 September 7, 2023:**\n    *   **Validate certificates before signature verification:** This addresses a vulnerability where an expired certificate with the same public key as an active certificate could be used to bypass signature verification, potentially allowing an attacker to forge SAML messages.\n\n*   **4.7.0 \u2013 March 15, 2023:**\n     * **Default the configuration flags `SignLogoutRequest`, `SignLogoutResponse`, `WantLogoutRequestSigned` and `WantLogoutResponseSigned` to true:** This enforces that logout messages are signed, protecting against tampering and replay attacks.\n     * **Default the configuration flag `SignAssertion` to true:** This enforces that SAML assertions are signed, ensuring integrity.\n     * **Default the configuration flags `SignAuthnRequest` and `WantAuthnRequestSigned` to true:** This enforces that authentication requests are signed, ensuring integrity and authenticity of requests.\n\n*   **4.6.0 \u2013 January 12, 2023:**\n    *   **When verifying signatures, only check the validity of the certificate used for the verification:** This addresses a vulnerability where expired or revoked certificates could be used if the validity checks were not specific to the certificate used for signature verification.\n   *   **When generating signatures, use a valid (ie non-expired) certificate:** This ensures that signatures generated are valid to prevent issues related to expired certificates.\n\n*   **4.5.0 \u2013 November 17, 2022:**\n    *   **Support multiple pending SAML responses within the one browser session:** This addresses a potential vulnerability where handling of concurrent SAML responses was inadequate, which might lead to incorrect processing of responses and potential security bypasses.\n\n*   **4.4.0 \u2013 September 7, 2022:**\n    *   **Use the System.Security.Cryptography.Xml update that addresses Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2022-34716:** This explicitly addresses the CVE-2022-34716, indicating a dependency on a fix for a known vulnerability in XML security handling.\n\n*   **2.9.0 \u2013 March 20, 2020:**\n    *   **Validate decrypted SAML assertions against the SAML XML schemas:** This addresses a potential vulnerability where improperly formatted SAML assertions, if not validated, could lead to unexpected behavior or security bypasses.\n    *   **Tighten up the InResponseTo checking:** This enhances security by ensuring that SAML responses are correctly matched to the corresponding requests.\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**\n\nThe root causes vary but broadly relate to:\n\n*   **Lack of proper validation:** Insufficient validation of SAML message elements like validity times, protocol bindings, and signatures.\n*   **Inadequate certificate handling:** Issues related to expired certificates, and not validating the correct certificate for signature verification.\n*   **Improper handling of concurrent requests:** Vulnerabilities arising from not handling concurrent SAML requests and responses correctly.\n*   **Reliance on defaults:** Not enforcing security defaults such as signing assertions, and relying on developers to configure them.\n*   **Dependency on vulnerable libraries:** Directly referencing and not updating libraries with known vulnerabilities such as CVE-2022-34716.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **SAML Message Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially manipulate SAML messages (authentication and logout requests, assertions) if not properly validated or signed.\n*   **Replay Attacks:**  Old, valid SAML messages could be replayed if validity times are not enforced.\n*   **Signature Forgery:**  Weaknesses in certificate handling or signature verification could allow attackers to forge SAML messages.\n*   **XML vulnerabilities:** Vulnerable XML handling could lead to exploits such as XXE.\n*   **Session Management Issues:**  Improper session management could lead to session hijacking or other related issues.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers might gain unauthorized access to systems or resources.\n*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers could potentially log out legitimate users.\n*   **Data Breach:** Tampered SAML assertions could lead to unauthorized modification or disclosure of data.\n*   **System Instability:** Improperly formatted SAML messages could lead to system errors or unexpected behaviors.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** Attackers could intercept and modify SAML messages in transit.\n*   **Replay Attacks:** Replaying previously captured SAML messages.\n*   **Malicious SAML Messages:** Crafting malicious SAML messages designed to exploit vulnerabilities.\n*   **Compromised Certificates:** Using expired or otherwise compromised certificates to bypass security checks.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** Attackers would typically need to be able to intercept or manipulate network traffic related to SAML exchanges.\n*   **Knowledge of SAML:** Attackers need to have a reasonable knowledge of the SAML protocol to craft malicious messages.\n*   **Compromised Credentials:** In some cases, attackers may need to have some form of compromised credentials or access to a certificate to initiate certain attacks.\n*   **Ability to intercept or modify SAML messages:** Either through a MitM position or by controlling part of the communication channel.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe release notes of ComponentSpace SAML for ASP.NET Core highlight a proactive approach to identifying and fixing potential security issues. The fixes generally involve stricter validation, improved certificate handling, and addressing specific vulnerabilities in underlying libraries. This information is valuable for understanding the security concerns related to SAML implementations and the importance of keeping libraries up to date.\n\n**Note:**\n\nThis analysis does not indicate any specific vulnerability with a CVE assigned, however based on the fixes described it indicates that there were vulnerabilities that could be exploited before the fixes were implemented.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 295 | Improper Certificate Validation | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.713 |\n| 2 | 296 | Improper Following of a Certificate's Chain of Trust | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.449 |\n| 3 | 345 | Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.433 |\n| 4 | 299 | Improper Check for Certificate Revocation | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.406 |\n| 5 | 297 | Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.386 |\n| 6 | 599 | Missing Validation of OpenSSL Certificate | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.519 |\n| 7 | 370 | Missing Check for Certificate Revocation after Initial Check | Variant | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 1007 | Insufficient Visual Distinction of Homoglyphs Presented to User | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.376 |\n| 9 | 1240 | Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.376 |\n| 10 | 319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.372 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by interfering in the communication path between the host and client. The product might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the product might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nPeerOf -> CWE-322\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-12496:** A Go framework for robotics, drones, and IoT devices skips verification of root CA certificates by default.\n- **CVE-2014-1266:** chain: incorrect \"goto\" in Apple SSL product bypasses certificate validation, allowing Adversary-in-the-Middle (AITM) attack (Apple \"goto fail\" bug). CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).\n- **CVE-2021-22909:** Chain: router's firmware update procedure uses curl with \"-k\" (insecure) option that disables certificate validation (CWE-295), allowing adversary-in-the-middle (AITM) compromise with a malicious firmware image (CWE-494).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-296: Improper Following of a Certificate's Chain of Trust\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not follow, or incorrectly follows, the chain of trust for a certificate back to a trusted root certificate, resulting in incorrect trust of any resource that is associated with that certificate.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nIf a system does not follow the chain of trust of a certificate to a root server, the certificate loses all usefulness as a metric of trust. Essentially, the trust gained from a certificate is derived from a chain of trust -- with a reputable trusted entity at the end of that list. The end user must trust that reputable source, and this reputable source must vouch for the resource in question through the medium of the certificate.\n\n\nIn some cases, this trust traverses several entities who vouch for one another. The entity trusted by the end user is at one end of this trust chain, while the certificate-wielding resource is at the other end of the chain. If the user receives a certificate at the end of one of these trust chains and then proceeds to check only that the first link in the chain, no real trust has been derived, since the entire chain must be traversed back to a trusted source to verify the certificate.\n\n\nThere are several ways in which the chain of trust might be broken, including but not limited to:\n\n\n  - Any certificate in the chain is self-signed, unless it the root.\n\n  - Not every intermediate certificate is checked, starting from the original certificate all the way up to the root certificate.\n\n  - An intermediate, CA-signed certificate does not have the expected Basic Constraints or other important extensions.\n\n  - The root certificate has been compromised or authorized to the wrong party.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-295\nChildOf -> CWE-573\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

In some sense, this is more like a category.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30260:** Distributed Control System (DCS) does not sign firmware images and only relies on insecure checksums for integrity checks\n- **CVE-2022-30267:** Distributed Control System (DCS) does not sign firmware images and only relies on insecure checksums for integrity checks\n- **CVE-2022-30272:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) does not use signatures for firmware images and relies on insecure checksums\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-299: Improper Check for Certificate Revocation\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks the revocation status of a certificate, which may cause it to use a certificate that has been compromised.\n\n### Extended Description\nAn improper check for certificate revocation is a far more serious flaw than related certificate failures. This is because the use of any revoked certificate is almost certainly malicious. The most common reason for certificate revocation is compromise of the system in question, with the result that no legitimate servers will be using a revoked certificate, unless they are sorely out of sync.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-295\nChildOf -> CWE-404\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

If the certificate's host-specific data is not properly checked - such as the Common Name (CN) in the Subject or the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension of an X.509 certificate - it may be possible for a redirection or spoofing attack to allow a malicious host with a valid certificate to provide data, impersonating a trusted host. In order to ensure data integrity, the certificate must be valid and it must pertain to the site that is being accessed.\n\n\nEven if the product attempts to check the hostname, it is still possible to incorrectly check the hostname. For example, attackers could create a certificate with a name that begins with a trusted name followed by a NUL byte, which could cause some string-based comparisons to only examine the portion that contains the trusted name.\n\n\nThis weakness can occur even when the product uses Certificate Pinning, if the product does not verify the hostname at the time a certificate is pinned.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-923\nChildOf -> CWE-295\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

As a result, other children of CWE-295 can be regarded as children of CWE-599 as well. CWE's use of one-dimensional hierarchical relationships is not well-suited to handle different kinds of abstraction relationships based on concepts like types of resources (\"OpenSSL certificate\" as a child of \"any certificate\") and types of behaviors (\"not validating expiration\" as a child of \"improper validation\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-370: Missing Check for Certificate Revocation after Initial Check\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not check the revocation status of a certificate after its initial revocation check, which can cause the product to perform privileged actions even after the certificate is revoked at a later time.\n\n### Extended Description\nIf the revocation status of a certificate is not checked before each action that requires privileges, the system may be subject to a race condition. If a certificate is revoked after the initial check, all subsequent actions taken with the owner of the revoked certificate will lose all benefits guaranteed by the certificate. In fact, it is almost certain that the use of a revoked certificate indicates malicious activity.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-299\nPeerOf -> CWE-296\nPeerOf -> CWE-297\nPeerOf -> CWE-298\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

These are referred to as homoglyphs. For example, the lowercase \"l\" (ell) and uppercase \"I\" (eye) have different character codes, but these characters can be displayed in exactly the same way to a user, depending on the font. This can also occur between different character sets. For example, the Latin capital letter \"A\" and the Greek capital letter \"\u0391\" (Alpha) are treated as distinct by programs, but may be displayed in exactly the same way to a user. Accent marks may also cause letters to appear very similar, such as the Latin capital letter grave mark \"\u00c0\" and its equivalent \"\u00c1\" with the acute accent.\n\n\nAdversaries can exploit this visual similarity for attacks such as phishing, e.g. by providing a link to an attacker-controlled hostname that looks like a hostname that the victim trusts. In a different use of homoglyphs, an adversary may create a back door username that is visually similar to the username of a regular user, which then makes it more difficult for a system administrator to detect the malicious username while reviewing logs.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nHomograph Attack: \"Homograph\" is often used as a synonym of \"homoglyph\" by researchers, but according to Wikipedia, a homograph is a word that has multiple, distinct meanings.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-451\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Some common examples of primitives are digital signatures, one-way hash functions, ciphers, and public key cryptography; however, the notion of \"primitive\" can vary depending on point of view. See \"Terminology Notes\" for further explanation of some concepts.\n\n\nCryptographic primitives are defined to accomplish one very specific task in a precisely defined and mathematically reliable fashion. For example, suppose that for a specific cryptographic primitive (such as an encryption routine), the consensus is that the primitive can only be broken after trying out N different inputs (where the larger the value of N, the stronger the cryptography). For an encryption scheme like AES-256, one would expect N to be so large as to be infeasible to execute in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n\nIf a vulnerability is ever found that shows that one can break a cryptographic primitive in significantly less than the expected number of attempts, then that primitive is considered weakened (or sometimes in extreme cases, colloquially it is \"broken\"). As a result, anything using this cryptographic primitive would now be considered insecure or risky. Thus, even breaking or weakening a seemingly small cryptographic primitive has the potential to render the whole system vulnerable, due to its reliance on the primitive. A historical example can be found in TLS when using DES. One would colloquially call DES the cryptographic primitive for transport encryption in this version of TLS. In the past, DES was considered strong, because no weaknesses were found in it; importantly, DES has a key length of 56 bits. Trying N=2^56 keys was considered impractical for most actors. Unfortunately, attacking a system with 56-bit keys is now practical via brute force, which makes defeating DES encryption practical. It is now practical for an adversary to read any information sent under this version of TLS and use this information to attack the system. As a result, it can be claimed that this use of TLS is weak, and that any system depending on TLS with DES could potentially render the entire system vulnerable to attack.\n\n\nCryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are only considered safe after extensive research and review from experienced cryptographers from academia, industry, and government entities looking for any possible flaws. Furthermore, cryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are frequently reevaluated for safety when new mathematical and attack techniques are discovered. As a result and over time, even well-known cryptographic primitives can lose their compliance status with the discovery of novel attacks that might either defeat the algorithm or reduce its robustness significantly.\n\n\nIf ad-hoc cryptographic primitives are implemented, it is almost certain that the implementation will be vulnerable to attacks that are well understood by cryptographers, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information and other consequences.\n\n\nThis weakness is even more difficult to manage for hardware-implemented deployment of cryptographic algorithms. First, because hardware is not patchable as easily as software, any flaw discovered after release and production typically cannot be fixed without a recall of the product. Secondly, the hardware product is often expected to work for years, during which time computation power available to the attacker only increases. Therefore, for hardware implementations of cryptographic primitives, it is absolutely essential that only strong, proven cryptographic primitives are used.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-327\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\n Terminology for cryptography varies widely, from informal and colloquial to mathematically-defined, with different precision and formalism depending on whether the stakeholder is a developer, cryptologist, etc. Yet there is a need for CWE to be self-consistent while remaining understandable and acceptable to multiple audiences.\n\n\nAs of CWE 4.6, CWE terminology around \"primitives\" and \"algorithms\" is emerging as shown by the following example, subject to future consultation and agreement within the CWE and cryptography communities. Suppose one wishes to send encrypted data using a CLI tool such as OpenSSL. One might choose to use AES with a 256-bit key and require tamper protection (GCM mode, for instance). For compatibility's sake, one might also choose the ciphertext to be formatted to the PKCS#5 standard. In this case, the \"cryptographic system\" would be AES-256-GCM with PKCS#5 formatting. The \"cryptographic function\" would be AES-256 in the GCM mode of operation, and the \"algorithm\" would be AES. Colloquially, one would say that AES (and sometimes AES-256) is the \"cryptographic primitive,\" because it is the algorithm that realizes the concept of symmetric encryption (without modes of operation or other protocol related modifications). In practice, developers and architects typically refer to base cryptographic algorithms (AES, SHA, etc.) as cryptographic primitives.\n\n\n**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-4778:** software uses MD5, which is less safe than the default SHA-256 used by related products\n- **CVE-2005-2946:** Default configuration of product uses MD5 instead of stronger algorithms that are available, simplifying forgery of certificates.\n- **CVE-2019-3907:** identity card uses MD5 hash of a salt and password\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany communication channels can be \"sniffed\" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.\n\n\nApplicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.\n\n\nWhen full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to \"sniff\" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information. \n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-311\nChildOf -> CWE-311\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

fixes a potential issue where a logout request might be replayed if not validated for its validity period, potentially allowing an attacker to log out legitimate users.\n    *   **Check the SAML assertion subject confirmation data validity time:**  This addresses a potential vulnerability where an attacker could replay old SAML assertions if the validity time of the subject confirmation data isn't verified, leading to unauthorized access.\n\n*   **4.9.0 \u2013 September 7, 2023:**\n    *   **Validate certificates before signature verification:** This addresses a vulnerability where an expired certificate with the same public key as an active certificate could be used to bypass signature verification, potentially allowing an attacker to forge SAML messages.\n\n*   **4.7.0 \u2013 March 15, 2023:**\n     * **Default the configuration flags `SignLogoutRequest`, `SignLogoutResponse`, `WantLogoutRequestSigned` and `WantLogoutResponseSigned` to true:** This enforces that logout messages are signed, protecting against tampering and replay attacks.\n     * **Default the configuration flag `SignAssertion` to true:** This enforces that SAML assertions are signed, ensuring integrity.\n     * **Default the configuration flags `SignAuthnRequest` and `WantAuthnRequestSigned` to true:** This enforces that authentication requests are signed, ensuring integrity and authenticity of requests.\n\n*   **4.6.0 \u2013 January 12, 2023:**\n    *   **When verifying signatures, only check the validity of the certificate used for the verification:** This addresses a vulnerability where expired or revoked certificates could be used if the validity checks were not specific to the certificate used for signature verification.\n   *   **When generating signatures, use a valid (ie non-expired) certificate:** This ensures that signatures generated are valid to prevent issues related to expired certificates.\n\n*   **4.5.0 \u2013 November 17, 2022:**\n    *   **Support multiple pending SAML responses within the one browser session:** This addresses a potential vulnerability where handling of concurrent SAML responses was inadequate, which might lead to incorrect processing of responses and potential security bypasses.\n\n*   **4.4.0 \u2013 September 7, 2022:**\n    *   **Use the System.Security.Cryptography.Xml update that addresses Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2022-34716:** This explicitly addresses the CVE-2022-34716, indicating a dependency on a fix for a known vulnerability in XML security handling.\n\n*   **2.9.0 \u2013 March 20, 2020:**\n    *   **Validate decrypted SAML assertions against the SAML XML schemas:** This addresses a potential vulnerability where improperly formatted SAML assertions, if not validated, could lead to unexpected behavior or security bypasses.\n    *   **Tighten up the InResponseTo checking:** This enhances security by ensuring that SAML responses are correctly matched to the corresponding requests.\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**\n\nThe root causes vary but broadly relate to:\n\n*   **Lack of proper validation:** Insufficient validation of SAML message elements like validity times, protocol bindings, and signatures.\n*   **Inadequate certificate handling:** Issues related to expired certificates, and not validating the correct certificate for signature verification.\n*   **Improper handling of concurrent requests:** Vulnerabilities arising from not handling concurrent SAML requests and responses correctly.\n*   **Reliance on defaults:** Not enforcing security defaults such as signing assertions, and relying on developers to configure them.\n*   **Dependency on vulnerable libraries:** Directly referencing and not updating libraries with known vulnerabilities such as CVE-2022-34716.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **SAML Message Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially manipulate SAML messages (authentication and logout requests, assertions) if not properly validated or signed.\n*   **Replay Attacks:**  Old, valid SAML messages could be replayed if validity times are not enforced.\n*   **Signature Forgery:**  Weaknesses in certificate handling or signature verification could allow attackers to forge SAML messages.\n*   **XML vulnerabilities:** Vulnerable XML handling could lead to exploits such as XXE.\n*   **Session Management Issues:**  Improper session management could lead to session hijacking or other related issues.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers might gain unauthorized access

designed to exploit vulnerabilities.\n*   **Compromised Certificates:** Using expired or otherwise compromised certificates to bypass security checks.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** Attackers would typically need to be able to intercept or manipulate network traffic related to SAML exchanges.\n*   **Knowledge of SAML:** Attackers need to have a reasonable knowledge of the SAML protocol to craft malicious messages.\n*   **Compromised Credentials:** In some cases, attackers may need to have some form of compromised credentials or access to a certificate to initiate certain attacks.\n*   **Ability to intercept or modify SAML messages:** Either through a MitM position or by controlling part of the communication channel.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe release notes of ComponentSpace SAML for ASP.NET Core highlight a proactive approach to identifying and fixing potential security issues. The fixes generally involve stricter validation, improved certificate handling, and addressing specific vulnerabilities in underlying libraries. This information is valuable for understanding the security concerns related to SAML implementations and the importance of keeping libraries up to date.\n\n**Note:**\n\nThis analysis does not indicate any specific vulnerability with a CVE assigned, however based on the fixes described it indicates that there were vulnerabilities that could be exploited before the fixes were implemented.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 295 | Improper Certificate Validation | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.713 |\n| 2 | 296 | Improper Following of a Certificate's Chain of Trust | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.449 |\n| 3 | 345 | Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.433 |\n| 4 | 299 | Improper Check for Certificate Revocation | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.406 |\n| 5 | 297 | Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.386 |\n| 6 | 599 | Missing Validation of OpenSSL Certificate | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.519 |\n| 7 | 370 | Missing Check for Certificate Revocation after Initial Check | Variant | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 1007 | Insufficient Visual Distinction of Homoglyphs Presented to User | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.376 |\n| 9 | 1240 | Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.376 |\n| 10 | 319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.372 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by interfering in the communication path between the host and client. The product might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the product might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nPeerOf -> CWE-322\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-12496:** A Go framework for robotics, drones, and IoT devices skips verification of root CA certificates by default.\n- **CVE-2014-1266:** chain: incorrect \"goto\" in Apple SSL product bypasses certificate validation, allowing Adversary-in-the-Middle (AITM) attack (Apple \"goto fail\" bug). CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).\n- **CVE-2021-22909:** Chain: router's firmware update procedure uses curl with \"-k\" (insecure) option that disables certificate validation (CWE-295), allowing adversary-in-the-middle (AITM) compromise with a malicious firmware image (CWE-494).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-296: Improper Following of a Certificate's Chain of Trust\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not follow, or incorrectly follows, the chain of trust for a certificate back to a trusted root certificate, resulting in incorrect trust of any resource that is associated with that certificate.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nIf a system does not follow the chain of trust of a certificate to a root server, the certificate loses all usefulness as a metric of trust. Essentially, the trust gained from a certificate is derived from a chain of trust -- with a reputable trusted entity at the end of that list. The end user must trust that reputable source, and this reputable source must vouch for the resource in question through the medium of the certificate.\n\n\nIn some cases, this trust traverses several entities who vouch for one another. The entity trusted by the end user is at one end of this trust chain, while the certificate-wielding resource is at the other end of the chain. If the user receives a certificate at the end of one of these trust chains and then proceeds to check only that the first link in the chain, no real trust has been derived, since the entire chain must be traversed back to a trusted source to verify the certificate.\n\n\nThere are several ways in which the chain of trust might be broken, including but not limited to:\n\n\n  - Any certificate in the chain is self-signed, unless it the root.\n\n  - Not every intermediate certificate is checked, starting from the original certificate all the way up to the root certificate.\n\n  - An intermediate, CA-signed certificate does not have the expected Basic Constraints or other important extensions.\n\n  - The root certificate has been compromised or authorized to the wrong party.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-295\nChildOf -> CWE-573\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \"origin validation\" could fall under this.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The specific ways in which the origin is not properly identified should be laid out as separate weaknesses. In some sense, this is more like a category.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30260:** Distributed Control System (DCS) does not sign firmware images and only relies on insecure checksums for integrity checks\n- **CVE-2022-30267:** Distributed Control System (DCS) does not sign firmware images and only relies on insecure checksums for integrity checks\n- **CVE-2022-30272:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) does not use signatures for firmware images and relies on insecure checksums\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-299: Improper Check for Certificate Revocation\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks the revocation status of a certificate, which may cause it to use a certificate that has been compromised.\n\n### Extended Description\nAn improper check for certificate revocation is a far more serious flaw than related certificate failures. This is because the use of any revoked certificate is almost certainly malicious. The most common reason for certificate revocation is compromise of the system in question, with the result that no legitimate servers will be using a revoked certificate, unless they are sorely out of sync.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-295\nChildOf -> CWE-404\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

If the certificate's host-specific data is not properly checked - such as the Common Name (CN) in the Subject or the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension of an X.509 certificate - it may be possible for a redirection or spoofing attack to allow a malicious host with a valid certificate to provide data, impersonating a trusted host. In order to ensure data integrity, the certificate must be valid and it must pertain to the site that is being accessed.\n\n\nEven if the product attempts to check the hostname, it is still possible to incorrectly check the hostname. For example, attackers could create a certificate with a name that begins with a trusted name followed by a NUL byte, which could cause some string-based comparisons to only examine the portion that contains the trusted name.\n\n\nThis weakness can occur even when the product uses Certificate Pinning, if the product does not verify the hostname at the time a certificate is pinned.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-923\nChildOf -> CWE-295\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** CWE-295 and CWE-599 are very similar, although CWE-599 has a more narrow scope that is only applied to OpenSSL certificates. As a result, other children of CWE-295 can be regarded as children of CWE-599 as well. CWE's use of one-dimensional hierarchical relationships is not well-suited to handle different kinds of abstraction relationships based on concepts like types of resources (\"OpenSSL certificate\" as a child of \"any certificate\") and types of behaviors (\"not validating expiration\" as a child of \"improper validation\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-370: Missing Check for Certificate Revocation after Initial Check\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not check the revocation status of a certificate after its initial revocation check, which can cause the product to perform privileged actions even after the certificate is revoked at a later time.\n\n### Extended Description\nIf the revocation status of a certificate is not checked before each action that requires privileges, the system may be subject to a race condition. If a certificate is revoked after the initial check, all subsequent actions taken with the owner of the revoked certificate will lose all benefits guaranteed by the certificate. In fact, it is almost certain that the use of a revoked certificate indicates malicious activity.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-299\nPeerOf -> CWE-296\nPeerOf -> CWE-297\nPeerOf -> CWE-298\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

These are referred to as homoglyphs. For example, the lowercase \"l\" (ell) and uppercase \"I\" (eye) have different character codes, but these characters can be displayed in exactly the same way to a user, depending on the font. This can also occur between different character sets. For example, the Latin capital letter \"A\" and the Greek capital letter \"\u0391\" (Alpha) are treated as distinct by programs, but may be displayed in exactly the same way to a user. Accent marks may also cause letters to appear very similar, such as the Latin capital letter grave mark \"\u00c0\" and its equivalent \"\u00c1\" with the acute accent.\n\n\nAdversaries can exploit this visual similarity for attacks such as phishing, e.g. by providing a link to an attacker-controlled hostname that looks like a hostname that the victim trusts. In a different use of homoglyphs, an adversary may create a back door username that is visually similar to the username of a regular user, which then makes it more difficult for a system administrator to detect the malicious username while reviewing logs.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nHomograph Attack: \"Homograph\" is often used as a synonym of \"homoglyph\" by researchers, but according to Wikipedia, a homograph is a word that has multiple, distinct meanings.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-451\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Some common examples of primitives are digital signatures, one-way hash functions, ciphers, and public key cryptography; however, the notion of \"primitive\" can vary depending on point of view. See \"Terminology Notes\" for further explanation of some concepts.\n\n\nCryptographic primitives are defined to accomplish one very specific task in a precisely defined and mathematically reliable fashion. For example, suppose that for a specific cryptographic primitive (such as an encryption routine), the consensus is that the primitive can only be broken after trying out N different inputs (where the larger the value of N, the stronger the cryptography). For an encryption scheme like AES-256, one would expect N to be so large as to be infeasible to execute in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n\nIf a vulnerability is ever found that shows that one can break a cryptographic primitive in significantly less than the expected number of attempts, then that primitive is considered weakened (or sometimes in extreme cases, colloquially it is \"broken\"). As a result, anything using this cryptographic primitive would now be considered insecure or risky. Thus, even breaking or weakening a seemingly small cryptographic primitive has the potential to render the whole system vulnerable, due to its reliance on the primitive. A historical example can be found in TLS when using DES. One would colloquially call DES the cryptographic primitive for transport encryption in this version of TLS. In the past, DES was considered strong, because no weaknesses were found in it; importantly, DES has a key length of 56 bits. Trying N=2^56 keys was considered impractical for most actors. Unfortunately, attacking a system with 56-bit keys is now practical via brute force, which makes defeating DES encryption practical. It is now practical for an adversary to read any information sent under this version of TLS and use this information to attack the system. As a result, it can be claimed that this use of TLS is weak, and that any system depending on TLS with DES could potentially render the entire system vulnerable to attack.\n\n\nCryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are only considered safe after extensive research and review from experienced cryptographers from academia, industry, and government entities looking for any possible flaws. Furthermore, cryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are frequently reevaluated for safety when new mathematical and attack techniques are discovered. As a result and over time, even well-known cryptographic primitives can lose their compliance status with the discovery of novel attacks that might either defeat the algorithm or reduce its robustness significantly.\n\n\nIf ad-hoc cryptographic primitives are implemented, it is almost certain that the implementation will be vulnerable to attacks that are well understood by cryptographers, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information and other consequences.\n\n\nThis weakness is even more difficult to manage for hardware-implemented deployment of cryptographic algorithms. First, because hardware is not patchable as easily as software, any flaw discovered after release and production typically cannot be fixed without a recall of the product. Secondly, the hardware product is often expected to work for years, during which time computation power available to the attacker only increases. Therefore, for hardware implementations of cryptographic primitives, it is absolutely essential that only strong, proven cryptographic primitives are used.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-327\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Suppose one wishes to send encrypted data using a CLI tool such as OpenSSL. One might choose to use AES with a 256-bit key and require tamper protection (GCM mode, for instance). For compatibility's sake, one might also choose the ciphertext to be formatted to the PKCS#5 standard. In this case, the \"cryptographic system\" would be AES-256-GCM with PKCS#5 formatting. The \"cryptographic function\" would be AES-256 in the GCM mode of operation, and the \"algorithm\" would be AES. Colloquially, one would say that AES (and sometimes AES-256) is the \"cryptographic primitive,\" because it is the algorithm that realizes the concept of symmetric encryption (without modes of operation or other protocol related modifications). In practice, developers and architects typically refer to base cryptographic algorithms (AES, SHA, etc.) as cryptographic primitives.\n\n\n**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-4778:** software uses MD5, which is less safe than the default SHA-256 used by related products\n- **CVE-2005-2946:** Default configuration of product uses MD5 instead of stronger algorithms that are available, simplifying forgery of certificates.\n- **CVE-2019-3907:** identity card uses MD5 hash of a salt and password\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany communication channels can be \"sniffed\" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.\n\n\nApplicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.\n\n\nWhen full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to \"sniff\" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information. \n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-311\nChildOf -> CWE-311\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29519:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends sensitive information in plaintext, including passwords and session tokens.\n- **CVE-2022-30312:** Building Controller uses a protocol that transmits authentication credentials in plaintext.\n- **CVE-2022-31204:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends password in plaintext.\n\n Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-319 CWE-297 CWE-311 CWE-312 CWE-347 CWE-1240 CWE-345 CWE-296 CWE-295",
