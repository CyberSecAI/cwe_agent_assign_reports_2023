Login attempts for valid, unlocked users configured to use PlexTrac as their authentication provider take significantly longer than those for invalid users, allowing for valid users to be enumerated by an unauthenticated remote attacker. Note that the lockout policy implemented in Plextrac version 1.17.0 makes it impossible to distinguish between valid, locked user accounts and user accounts that do not exist, but does not prevent valid, unlocked users from being enumerated.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **impact:** username enumeration\n- **vector:** HTTP response times on invalid login attempts\n- **attacker:** unauthenticated remote attacker\n- **product:** PlexTrac platform\n- **version:** prior to version 1.28.0\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\n```\n{\n  \"vulnerability_details\": {\n    \"root_cause\": \"The application's response times for valid and invalid users differed, allowing attackers to distinguish between them.\",\n    \"weaknesses\": [\n      \"Username enumeration vulnerability via HTTP response timing differences.\"\n    ],\n    \"impact\": \"Attackers could identify valid usernames (email addresses), making it easier to conduct brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and targeted social engineering attacks.\",\n    \"attack_vectors\": \"By sending login or password reset requests, an attacker can measure the response time to differentiate between valid and invalid usernames.\",\n    \"required_capabilities\": \"The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests and measure response times.\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 208 | Observable Timing Discrepancy | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.285 |\n| 2 | 1390 | Weak Authentication | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.181 |\n| 3 | 204 | Observable Response Discrepancy | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.181 |\n| 4 | 287 | Improper Authentication | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.169 |\n| 5 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.165 |\n| 6 | 307 | Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.445 |\n| 7 | 613 | Insufficient Session Expiration | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 203 | Observable Discrepancy | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.157 |\n| 9 | 90 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.155 |\n| 10 | 347 | Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.153 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nTwo separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n### Extended Description\nIn security-relevant contexts, even small variations in timing can be exploited by attackers to indirectly infer certain details about the product's internal operations.

For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n### Extended Description\nDiscrepancies can take many forms, and variations may be detectable in timing, control flow, communications such as replies or requests, or general behavior. These discrepancies can reveal information about the product's operation or internal state to an unauthorized actor. In some cases, discrepancies can be used by attackers to form a side channel.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nSide Channel Attack: Observable Discrepancies are at the root of side channel attacks.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nChildOf -> CWE-200\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

    "enhanced_query": "## Vulnerability Description\nThe PlexTrac platform prior to version 1.28.0 allows for username enumeration via HTTP response times on invalid login attempts for users configured to use the PlexTrac authentication provider. Login attempts for valid, unlocked users configured to use PlexTrac as their authentication provider take significantly longer than those for invalid users, allowing for valid users to be enumerated by an unauthenticated remote attacker. Note that the lockout policy implemented in Plextrac version 1.17.0 makes it impossible to distinguish between valid, locked user accounts and user accounts that do not exist, but does not prevent valid, unlocked users from being enumerated.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **impact:** username enumeration\n- **vector:** HTTP response times on invalid login attempts\n- **attacker:** unauthenticated remote attacker\n- **product:** PlexTrac platform\n- **version:** prior to version 1.28.0\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\n```\n{\n  \"vulnerability_details\": {\n    \"root_cause\": \"The application's response times for valid and invalid users differed, allowing attackers to distinguish between them.\",\n    \"weaknesses\": [\n      \"Username enumeration vulnerability via HTTP response timing differences.\"\n    ],\n    \"impact\": \"Attackers could identify valid usernames (email addresses), making it easier to conduct brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and targeted social engineering attacks.\",\n    \"attack_vectors\": \"By sending login or password reset requests, an attacker can measure the response time to differentiate between valid and invalid usernames.\",\n    \"required_capabilities\": \"The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests and measure response times.\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 208 | Observable Timing Discrepancy | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.285 |\n| 2 | 1390 | Weak Authentication | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.181 |\n| 3 | 204 | Observable Response Discrepancy | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.181 |\n| 4 | 287 | Improper Authentication | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.169 |\n| 5 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.165 |\n| 6 | 307 | Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.445 |\n| 7 | 613 | Insufficient Session Expiration | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 203 | Observable Discrepancy | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.157 |\n| 9 | 90 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.155 |\n| 10 | 347 | Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.153 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nTwo separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n### Extended Description\nIn security-relevant contexts, even small variations in timing can be exploited by attackers to indirectly infer certain details about the product's internal operations. For example, in some cryptographic algorithms, attackers can use timing differences to infer certain properties about a private key, making the key easier to guess. Timing discrepancies effectively form a timing side channel.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-203\nCanPrecede -> CWE-385\nCanPrecede -> CWE-327\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
