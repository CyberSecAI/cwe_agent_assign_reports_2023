This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product AndroidVersions Android kernelAndroid ID A-174846563References Upstream kernel\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **race condition**\n- **weakness:** **use after free**\n- **impact:** local escalation of privilege\n- **product:** Android kernel\n- **component:** lock_sock_nested of sock.c\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20154:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n- The vulnerability is a use-after-free issue in the `sctp_sock_dump()` function within the SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel.\n- The issue arises when an association (`asoc`) is \"peeled off,\" meaning its associated socket (`sk`) is freed. This occurs after the socket is obtained via `asoc->base.sk` but before `lock_sock(sk)` is called. This creates a race condition where the socket can be freed before it is locked, leading to a use-after-free when the lock is acquired later.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n- **Use-After-Free:** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free, where a memory region (the socket) is accessed after it has been freed.\n- **Race Condition:** The vulnerability is triggered by a race condition between the freeing of the socket and the attempt to lock it.\n- **Lack of Proper Synchronization:** The code lacked proper synchronization to ensure that the endpoint and socket remained valid during the dumping process.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Kernel Panic:** The use-after-free can lead to a kernel panic, which can cause a system crash.\n- **Memory Corruption:**  Accessing freed memory can also lead to memory corruption.\n- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, it's possible that with careful exploitation, the vulnerability might allow for more serious consequences, like arbitrary code execution, due to the memory corruption.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- The vulnerability is triggered within the SCTP diagnostic dump functionality (`sctp_sock_dump`). \n- This function is typically invoked via netlink and the `inet_diag` family.\n- An attacker would need to trigger the association peel-off, while simultaneously requesting an SCTP socket dump using the netlink interface.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- An attacker needs the capability to interact with the netlink interface and send SCTP related requests.\n- The attacker must be in a position to trigger the association \"peel off\" operation concurrently with the diagnostic dump request.\n\n**Mitigation:**\n\nThe fix implemented by the patch involves:\n\n- **Delayed Endpoint Freeing:** The patch uses `call_rcu()` to delay the freeing of the endpoint (`ep`). This ensures that the endpoint remains alive until after the critical section where the socket is accessed is completed.\n- **`sctp_endpoint_destroy_rcu()`:** The `sock_put` and `ep` free is moved to this new function which is called via `call_rcu`.\n- **`sctp_endpoint_hold()`:**  The code uses `sctp_endpoint_hold()` under `rcu_read_lock` to check if the endpoint is still alive before attempting to access the socket. If the endpoint is dead, it skips it.\n- **Consistency Checks:** The code now checks if the endpoint is the same before and after locking the socket. If the endpoint changes during this time, it skips the socket.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The patch includes a fix for accessing the socket via `asoc->base.sk` in `sctp_assocs_seq_show()` and `sctp_rcv()`, as well.\n- The patch addresses the issue reported by syzbot and Lee Jones.\n- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, not Android specifically, but it is addressed in the Pixel update bulletin.\n- The provided content offers a detailed explanation of the bug and the implemented fix.\n\n**In summary, CVE-2022-20154 is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel SCTP implementation. It can lead to a crash or memory corruption and is triggered by a race condition when an SCTP association is peeled off during a diagnostic dump. The fix uses delayed freeing and RCU to ensure the endpoint and its socket are not accessed after they've been freed.**\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') | Class | Allowed-with-Review | alternate_terms | 1.000 |\n| 2 | 667 | Improper Locking | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.428 |\n| 3 | 413 | Improper Resource Locking | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.418 |\n| 4 | 665 | Improper Initialization | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.373 |\n| 5 | 662 | Improper Synchronization | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.368 |\n| 6 | 909 | Missing Initialization of Resource | Class | Allowed-with-Review | dense | 0.619 |\n| 7 | 476 | NULL Pointer Dereference | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 366 | Race Condition within a Thread | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.367 |\n| 9 | 416 | Use After Free | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.346 |\n| 10 | 415 | Double Free | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.344 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nA race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence.

They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.\n\n**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nLocking is a type of synchronization behavior that ensures that multiple independently-operating processes or threads do not interfere with each other when accessing the same resource. All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms. Multiple entries are dependent on this research, which includes relationships to concurrency, race conditions, reentrant functions, etc. CWE-662 and its children - including CWE-667, CWE-820, CWE-821, and others - may need to be modified significantly, along with their relationships.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2009-0935:** Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice\n- **CVE-2010-4210:** function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not lock or does not correctly lock a resource when the product must have exclusive access to the resource.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a resource is not properly locked, an attacker could modify the resource while it is being operated on by the product. This might violate the product's assumption that the resource will not change, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-667\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Some shared resource operations cannot be executed atomically; that is, multiple steps must be guaranteed to execute sequentially, without any interference by other processes. Synchronization mechanisms vary widely, but they may include locking, mutexes, and semaphores. When a multi-step operation on a shared resource cannot be guaranteed to execute independent of interference, then the resulting behavior can be unpredictable. Improper synchronization could lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-664\nChildOf -> CWE-691\nCanPrecede -> CWE-362\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

This corruption can cause the program to crash or, in some circumstances, cause two later calls to malloc() to return the same pointer. If malloc() returns the same value twice and the program later gives the attacker control over the data that is written into this doubly-allocated memory, the program becomes vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDouble-free\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-825\nChildOf -> CWE-1341\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-666\nPeerOf -> CWE-416\nPeerOf -> CWE-123\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

It could also be primary to weaknesses such as buffer overflows.\n\n**[Theoretical]** It could be argued that Double Free would be most appropriately located as a child of \"Use after Free\", but \"Use\" and \"Release\" are considered to be distinct operations within vulnerability theory, therefore this is more accurately \"Release of a Resource after Expiration or Release\", which doesn't exist yet.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2006-5051:** Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\n- **CVE-2004-0642:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n- **CVE-2004-0772:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n\n Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-415 CWE-366 CWE-662 CWE-364 CWE-667 CWE-226 CWE-404 CWE-362",

    "enhanced_query": "## Vulnerability Description\nIn lock_sock_nested of sock.c, there is a possible **use after free** due to a **race condition**. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product AndroidVersions Android kernelAndroid ID A-174846563References Upstream kernel\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **race condition**\n- **weakness:** **use after free**\n- **impact:** local escalation of privilege\n- **product:** Android kernel\n- **component:** lock_sock_nested of sock.c\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20154:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n- The vulnerability is a use-after-free issue in the `sctp_sock_dump()` function within the SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel.\n- The issue arises when an association (`asoc`) is \"peeled off,\" meaning its associated socket (`sk`) is freed. This occurs after the socket is obtained via `asoc->base.sk` but before `lock_sock(sk)` is called. This creates a race condition where the socket can be freed before it is locked, leading to a use-after-free when the lock is acquired later.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n- **Use-After-Free:** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free, where a memory region (the socket) is accessed after it has been freed.\n- **Race Condition:** The vulnerability is triggered by a race condition between the freeing of the socket and the attempt to lock it.\n- **Lack of Proper Synchronization:** The code lacked proper synchronization to ensure that the endpoint and socket remained valid during the dumping process.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Kernel Panic:** The use-after-free can lead to a kernel panic, which can cause a system crash.\n- **Memory Corruption:**  Accessing freed memory can also lead to memory corruption.\n- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, it's possible that with careful exploitation, the vulnerability might allow for more serious consequences, like arbitrary code execution, due to the memory corruption.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- The vulnerability is triggered within the SCTP diagnostic dump functionality (`sctp_sock_dump`). \n- This function is typically invoked via netlink and the `inet_diag` family.\n- An attacker would need to trigger the association peel-off, while simultaneously requesting an SCTP socket dump using the netlink interface.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- An attacker needs the capability to interact with the netlink interface and send SCTP related requests.\n- The attacker must be in a position to trigger the association \"peel off\" operation concurrently with the diagnostic dump request.\n\n**Mitigation:**\n\nThe fix implemented by the patch involves:\n\n- **Delayed Endpoint Freeing:** The patch uses `call_rcu()` to delay the freeing of the endpoint (`ep`). This ensures that the endpoint remains alive until after the critical section where the socket is accessed is completed.\n- **`sctp_endpoint_destroy_rcu()`:** The `sock_put` and `ep` free is moved to this new function which is called via `call_rcu`.\n- **`sctp_endpoint_hold()`:**  The code uses `sctp_endpoint_hold()` under `rcu_read_lock` to check if the endpoint is still alive before attempting to access the socket. If the endpoint is dead, it skips it.\n- **Consistency Checks:** The code now checks if the endpoint is the same before and after locking the socket. If the endpoint changes during this time, it skips the socket.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The patch includes a fix for accessing the socket via `asoc->base.sk` in `sctp_assocs_seq_show()` and `sctp_rcv()`, as well.\n- The patch addresses the issue reported by syzbot and Lee Jones.\n- The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, not Android specifically, but it is addressed in the Pixel update bulletin.\n- The provided content offers a detailed explanation of the bug and the implemented fix.\n\n**In summary, CVE-2022-20154 is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel SCTP implementation. It can lead to a crash or memory corruption and is triggered by a race condition when an SCTP association is peeled off during a diagnostic dump. The fix uses delayed freeing and RCU to ensure the endpoint and its socket are not accessed after they've been freed.**\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') | Class | Allowed-with-Review | alternate_terms | 1.000 |\n| 2 | 667 | Improper Locking | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.428 |\n| 3 | 413 | Improper Resource Locking | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.418 |\n| 4 | 665 | Improper Initialization | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.373 |\n| 5 | 662 | Improper Synchronization | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.368 |\n| 6 | 909 | Missing Initialization of Resource | Class | Allowed-with-Review | dense | 0.619 |\n| 7 | 476 | NULL Pointer Dereference | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 366 | Race Condition within a Thread | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.367 |\n| 9 | 416 | Use After Free | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.346 |\n| 10 | 415 | Double Free | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.344 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nA race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence.

Some shared resource operations cannot be executed atomically; that is, multiple steps must be guaranteed to execute sequentially, without any interference by other processes. Synchronization mechanisms vary widely, but they may include locking, mutexes, and semaphores. When a multi-step operation on a shared resource cannot be guaranteed to execute independent of interference, then the resulting behavior can be unpredictable. Improper synchronization could lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-664\nChildOf -> CWE-691\nCanPrecede -> CWE-362\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms. Multiple entries are dependent on this research, which includes relationships to concurrency, race conditions, reentrant functions, etc. CWE-662 and its children - including CWE-667, CWE-820, CWE-821, and others - may need to be modified significantly, along with their relationships.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2009-0935:** Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not initialize a critical resource.\n\n### Extended Description\nMany resources require initialization before they can be properly used. If a resource is not initialized, it could contain unpredictable or expired data, or it could be initialized to defaults that are invalid. This can have security implications when the resource is expected to have certain properties or values.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nCanPrecede -> CWE-908\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-20739:** A variable that has its value set in a conditional statement is sometimes used when the conditional fails, sometimes causing data leakage\n- **CVE-2005-1036:** Chain: Bypass of access restrictions due to improper authorization (CWE-862) of a user results from an improperly initialized (CWE-909) I/O permission bitmap\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNPD: Common abbreviation for Null Pointer Dereference\nnull deref: Common abbreviation for Null Pointer Dereference\nNPE: Common abbreviation for Null Pointer Exception\nnil pointer dereference: used for access of nil in Go programs\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-710\nChildOf -> CWE-754\nChildOf -> CWE-754\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2005-3274:** race condition causes a table to be corrupted if a timer activates while it is being modified, leading to resultant NULL dereference; also involves locking.\n- **CVE-2002-1912:** large number of packets leads to NULL dereference\n- **CVE-2005-0772:** packet with invalid error status value triggers NULL dereference\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-362\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-2621:** Chain: two threads in a web browser use the same resource (CWE-366), but one of those threads can destroy the resource before the other has completed (CWE-416).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-416: Use After Free\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory \"belongs\" to the code that operates on the new pointer.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDangling pointer: a pointer that no longer points to valid memory, often after it has been freed\nUAF: commonly used acronym for Use After Free\nUse-After-Free\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-825\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nCanPrecede -> CWE-120\nCanPrecede -> CWE-123\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-20141:** Chain: an operating system kernel has insufficent resource locking (CWE-413) leading to a use after free (CWE-416).\n- **CVE-2022-2621:** Chain: two threads in a web browser use the same resource (CWE-366), but one of those threads can destroy the resource before the other has completed (CWE-416).\n- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-415: Double Free\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a program calls free() twice with the same argument, the program's memory management data structures become corrupted. This corruption can cause the program to crash or, in some circumstances, cause two later calls to malloc() to return the same pointer. If malloc() returns the same value twice and the program later gives the attacker control over the data that is written into this doubly-allocated memory, the program becomes vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDouble-free\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-825\nChildOf -> CWE-1341\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-666\nPeerOf -> CWE-416\nPeerOf -> CWE-123\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is usually resultant from another weakness, such as an unhandled error or race condition between threads. It could also be primary to weaknesses such as buffer overflows.\n\n**[Theoretical]** It could be argued that Double Free would be most appropriately located as a child of \"Use after Free\", but \"Use\" and \"Release\" are considered to be distinct operations within vulnerability theory, therefore this is more accurately \"Release of a Resource after Expiration or Release\", which doesn't exist yet.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2006-5051:** Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\n- **CVE-2004-0642:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n- **CVE-2004-0772:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n\n Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-415 CWE-366 CWE-662 CWE-364 CWE-667 CWE-226 CWE-404 CWE-362",
