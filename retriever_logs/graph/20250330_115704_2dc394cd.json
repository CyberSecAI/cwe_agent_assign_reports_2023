Instead, the username (not password) was saved by the Form Manager to an unencrypted file on disk. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 106.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **improper user data storage**\n- **impact:** potential for unencrypted storage of sensitive data\n- **product:** Firefox\n- **version:** < 106\n- **component:** Form Manager\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-42931:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability stems from the Firefox Form Manager saving usernames in plain text to the `formhistory.sqlite` database, even when the login is managed by the Password Manager, which is intended to encrypt such data.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Plaintext Storage:** Usernames, which should be protected, were being stored in an unencrypted database (`formhistory.sqlite`).\n- **Incorrect Data Handling:** The Form Manager incorrectly handled forms also managed by the Password Manager. It did not check if the input was managed by the Login Manager before saving it to the `formhistory.sqlite` database.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker with access to the user's profile could obtain plaintext usernames from the `formhistory.sqlite` file. While passwords were not directly exposed, the leaked usernames could be used in subsequent attacks.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Local File Access:** An attacker needs to gain access to the user's local file system and specifically to the `formhistory.sqlite` file within the Firefox profile directory. This could be achieved through malware or physical access to the machine.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Local Access:** The attacker must have access to the user's machine and the ability to read the filesystem.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability was considered low severity due to the fact that passwords were not directly exposed and the vulnerability required local file access to exploit.\n- The issue was addressed by ensuring that the Form Manager checks if the input is managed by the Login Manager before saving it to the FormHistory database.\n- The fix was included in Firefox 106.\n- The bug was similar to a previous bug, [bug 394612](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=394612).\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 313 | Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.469 |\n| 2 | 522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.278 |\n| 3 | 312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.275 |\n| 4 | 256 | Plaintext Storage of a Password | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.265 |\n| 5 | 532 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.250 |\n| 6 | 257 | Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.463 |\n| 7 | 916 | Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 266 | Incorrect Privilege Assignment | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.240 |\n| 9 | 316 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.230 |\n| 10 | 346 | Origin Validation Error | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.230 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-313: Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext in a file, or on disk.\n\n### Extended Description\nThe sensitive information could be read by attackers with access to the file, or with physical or administrator access to the raw disk.

In this design, authentication involves accepting an incoming password, computing its hash, and comparing it to the stored hash.\n\n\nMany hash algorithms are designed to execute quickly with minimal overhead, even cryptographic hashes. However, this efficiency is a problem for password storage, because it can reduce an attacker's workload for brute-force password cracking. If an attacker can obtain the hashes through some other method (such as SQL injection on a database that stores hashes), then the attacker can store the hashes offline and use various techniques to crack the passwords by computing hashes efficiently. Without a built-in workload, modern attacks can compute large numbers of hashes, or even exhaust the entire space of all possible passwords, within a very short amount of time, using massively-parallel computing (such as cloud computing) and GPU, ASIC, or FPGA hardware. In such a scenario, an efficient hash algorithm helps the attacker.\n\n\nThere are several properties of a hash scheme that are relevant to its strength against an offline, massively-parallel attack:\n\n\n  - The amount of CPU time required to compute the hash (\"stretching\")\n\n  - The amount of memory required to compute the hash (\"memory-hard\" operations)\n\n  - Including a random value, along with the password, as input to the hash computation (\"salting\")\n\n  - Given a hash, there is no known way of determining an input (e.g., a password) that produces this hash value, other than by guessing possible inputs (\"one-way\" hashing)\n\n  - Relative to the number of all possible hashes that can be generated by the scheme, there is a low likelihood of producing the same hash for multiple different inputs (\"collision resistance\")\n\nNote that the security requirements for the product may vary depending on the environment and the value of the passwords. Different schemes might not provide all of these properties, yet may still provide sufficient security for the environment. Conversely, a solution might be very strong in preserving one property, which still being very weak for an attack against another property, or it might not be able to significantly reduce the efficiency of a massively-parallel attack.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-328\nChildOf -> CWE-327\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

See terminology notes.\n\n**[Terminology]** The \"Origin Validation Error\" term was originally used in a 1995 thesis [REF-324]. Although not formally defined, an issue is considered to be an origin validation error if either (1) \"an object [accepts] input from an unauthorized subject,\" or (2) \"the system [fails] to properly or completely authenticate a subject.\" A later section says that an origin validation error can occur when the system (1) \"does not properly authenticate a user or process\" or (2) \"does not properly authenticate the shared data or libraries.\" The only example provided in the thesis (covered by OSVDB:57615) involves a setuid program running command-line arguments without dropping privileges. So, this definition (and its examples in the thesis) effectively cover other weaknesses such as CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), and CWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges). There appears to be little usage of this term today, except in the SecurityFocus vulnerability database, where the term is used for a variety of issues, including web-browser problems that allow violation of the Same Origin Policy and improper validation of the source of an incoming message.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2000-1218:** DNS server can accept DNS updates from hosts that it did not query, leading to cache poisoning\n- **CVE-2005-0877:** DNS server can accept DNS updates from hosts that it did not query, leading to cache poisoning\n- **CVE-2001-1452:** DNS server caches glue records received from non-delegated name servers\n\n Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-916 CWE-319 CWE-522 CWE-312 CWE-532 CWE-256 CWE-538 CWE-226 CWE-212",

In this design, authentication involves accepting an incoming password, computing its hash, and comparing it to the stored hash.\n\n\nMany hash algorithms are designed to execute quickly with minimal overhead, even cryptographic hashes. However, this efficiency is a problem for password storage, because it can reduce an attacker's workload for brute-force password cracking. If an attacker can obtain the hashes through some other method (such as SQL injection on a database that stores hashes), then the attacker can store the hashes offline and use various techniques to crack the passwords by computing hashes efficiently. Without a built-in workload, modern attacks can compute large numbers of hashes, or even exhaust the entire space of all possible passwords, within a very short amount of time, using massively-parallel computing (such as cloud computing) and GPU, ASIC, or FPGA hardware. In such a scenario, an efficient hash algorithm helps the attacker.\n\n\nThere are several properties of a hash scheme that are relevant to its strength against an offline, massively-parallel attack:\n\n\n  - The amount of CPU time required to compute the hash (\"stretching\")\n\n  - The amount of memory required to compute the hash (\"memory-hard\" operations)\n\n  - Including a random value, along with the password, as input to the hash computation (\"salting\")\n\n  - Given a hash, there is no known way of determining an input (e.g., a password) that produces this hash value, other than by guessing possible inputs (\"one-way\" hashing)\n\n  - Relative to the number of all possible hashes that can be generated by the scheme, there is a low likelihood of producing the same hash for multiple different inputs (\"collision resistance\")\n\nNote that the security requirements for the product may vary depending on the environment and the value of the passwords. Different schemes might not provide all of these properties, yet may still provide sufficient security for the environment. Conversely, a solution might be very strong in preserving one property, which still being very weak for an attack against another property, or it might not be able to significantly reduce the efficiency of a massively-parallel attack.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-328\nChildOf -> CWE-327\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

See terminology notes.\n\n**[Terminology]** The \"Origin Validation Error\" term was originally used in a 1995 thesis [REF-324]. Although not formally defined, an issue is considered to be an origin validation error if either (1) \"an object [accepts] input from an unauthorized subject,\" or (2) \"the system [fails] to properly or completely authenticate a subject.\" A later section says that an origin validation error can occur when the system (1) \"does not properly authenticate a user or process\" or (2) \"does not properly authenticate the shared data or libraries.\" The only example provided in the thesis (covered by OSVDB:57615) involves a setuid program running command-line arguments without dropping privileges. So, this definition (and its examples in the thesis) effectively cover other weaknesses such as CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), and CWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges). There appears to be little usage of this term today, except in the SecurityFocus vulnerability database, where the term is used for a variety of issues, including web-browser problems that allow violation of the Same Origin Policy and improper validation of the source of an incoming message.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2000-1218:** DNS server can accept DNS updates from hosts that it did not query, leading to cache poisoning\n- **CVE-2005-0877:** DNS server can accept DNS updates from hosts that it did not query, leading to cache poisoning\n- **CVE-2001-1452:** DNS server caches glue records received from non-delegated name servers\n\n",
    "enhanced_query": "## Vulnerability Description\nLogins saved by Firefox should be managed by the Password Manager component which uses encryption to save files on-disk. Instead, the username (not password) was saved by the Form Manager to an unencrypted file on disk. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 106.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **improper user data storage**\n- **impact:** potential for unencrypted storage of sensitive data\n- **product:** Firefox\n- **version:** < 106\n- **component:** Form Manager\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-42931:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability stems from the Firefox Form Manager saving usernames in plain text to the `formhistory.sqlite` database, even when the login is managed by the Password Manager, which is intended to encrypt such data.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Plaintext Storage:** Usernames, which should be protected, were being stored in an unencrypted database (`formhistory.sqlite`).\n- **Incorrect Data Handling:** The Form Manager incorrectly handled forms also managed by the Password Manager. It did not check if the input was managed by the Login Manager before saving it to the `formhistory.sqlite` database.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker with access to the user's profile could obtain plaintext usernames from the `formhistory.sqlite` file. While passwords were not directly exposed, the leaked usernames could be used in subsequent attacks.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Local File Access:** An attacker needs to gain access to the user's local file system and specifically to the `formhistory.sqlite` file within the Firefox profile directory. This could be achieved through malware or physical access to the machine.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Local Access:** The attacker must have access to the user's machine and the ability to read the filesystem.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability was considered low severity due to the fact that passwords were not directly exposed and the vulnerability required local file access to exploit.\n- The issue was addressed by ensuring that the Form Manager checks if the input is managed by the Login Manager before saving it to the FormHistory database.\n- The fix was included in Firefox 106.\n- The bug was similar to a previous bug, [bug 394612](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=394612).\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 313 | Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.469 |\n| 2 | 522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.278 |\n| 3 | 312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.275 |\n| 4 | 256 | Plaintext Storage of a Password | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.265 |\n| 5 | 532 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.250 |\n| 6 | 257 | Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.463 |\n| 7 | 916 | Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 266 | Incorrect Privilege Assignment | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.240 |\n| 9 | 316 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.230 |\n| 10 | 346 | Origin Validation Error | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.230 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-313: Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext in a file, or on disk.\n\n### Extended Description\nThe sensitive information could be read by attackers with access to the file, or with physical or administrator access to the raw disk.

Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-readable (such as base64 encoding).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-1517:** Sensitive authentication information in cleartext in memory.\n- **CVE-2001-0984:** Password protector leaves passwords in memory when window is minimized, even when \"clear password when minimized\" is set.\n- **CVE-2003-0291:** SSH client does not clear credentials from memory.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry has some significant overlap with other CWE entries and may need some clarification. See terminology notes.\n\n**[Terminology]** The \"Origin Validation Error\" term was originally used in a 1995 thesis [REF-324]. Although not formally defined, an issue is considered to be an origin validation error if either (1) \"an object [accepts] input from an unauthorized subject,\" or (2) \"the system [fails] to properly or completely authenticate a subject.\" A later section says that an origin validation error can occur when the system (1) \"does not properly authenticate a user or process\" or (2) \"does not properly authenticate the shared data or libraries.\" The only example provided in the thesis (covered by OSVDB:57615) involves a setuid program running command-line arguments without dropping privileges. So, this definition (and its examples in the thesis) effectively cover other weaknesses such as CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), and CWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges). There appears to be little usage of this term today, except in the SecurityFocus vulnerability database, where the term is used for a variety of issues, including web-browser problems that allow violation of the Same Origin Policy and improper validation of the source of an incoming message.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2000-1218:** DNS server can accept DNS updates from hosts that it did not query, leading to cache poisoning\n- **CVE-2005-0877:** DNS server can accept DNS updates from hosts that it did not query, leading to cache poisoning\n- **CVE-2001-1452:** DNS server caches glue records received from non-delegated name servers\n\n Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-916 CWE-319 CWE-522 CWE-312 CWE-532 CWE-256 CWE-538 CWE-226 CWE-212",
