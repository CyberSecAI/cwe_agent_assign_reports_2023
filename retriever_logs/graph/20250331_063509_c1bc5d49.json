When this feature is enabled, GRUB requires a password to access the GRUB command-line, modify kernel command-line arguments, or boot non-default OSTree deployments. Recent Fedora CoreOS releases have a **misconfiguration** which allows booting non-default OSTree deployments without entering a password. This allows someone with access to the GRUB menu to boot into an older version of Fedora CoreOS, reverting any security fixes that have recently been applied to the machine. A password is still required to modify kernel command-line arguments and to access the GRUB command line.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **misconfiguration**\n- **impact:** boot non-default OSTree deployments without password\n- **product:** Fedora CoreOS\n- **version:** recent releases\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-3675:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- A misconfiguration in recent Fedora CoreOS releases, specifically in how the `sysroot.bls-append-except-default` option was being set within the OSTree configuration. The conditional statement used to set the `sysroot.bls-append-except-default` option in `coreos-assembler` was invalid, causing the option to not be set in affected builds. This option is responsible for restricting the boot of non-default OSTree deployments to only authorized users, by specifying the `grub_users` parameter in the BLS configuration files.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- Incorrect configuration of the `sysroot.bls-append-except-default` option, which controls access to non-default OSTree deployments via GRUB.\n- The conditional statement in `coreos-assembler` that was supposed to set the `sysroot.bls-append-except-default` value failed due to invalid syntax.\n- Consequently, the `grub_users` setting was not being added to the non-default BLS configuration files.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- An attacker with access to the GRUB menu can bypass the GRUB password protection and boot into non-default OSTree deployments (older versions of Fedora CoreOS) without providing the required password. This allows the attacker to bypass security fixes applied to the system.\n- The attacker cannot modify kernel command-line arguments or access the GRUB command line without the correct password.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- Physical access to the system or access to the GRUB menu through other means, such as a remote console.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker must have the ability to access the GRUB menu during system boot.\n- A basic knowledge of how to navigate the GRUB menu to select a non-default deployment is also required.\n\n**Affected Releases**\n- `stable` 36.20220820.3.0 and later\n- `testing` 36.20220906.2.0 and later\n- `next` 36.20220906.1.0 and later\n\n**Mitigation:**\n- The vulnerability is fixed in the following releases:\n  - `stable` 36.20221014.3.0 (new machines), 36.20221030.3.0 (existing machines)\n  - `testing` 36.20221030.2.0 (new and existing machines)\n  - `next` 37.20221031.1.0 (new and existing machines)\n- A manual fix for affected machines involves running the commands:\n  ```\n  sudo ostree config set sysroot.bls-append-except-default 'grub_users=\"\"'\n  sudo unshare -mw /boot/loader/entries bash -c \\\n  'mount -o rw,remount /boot &&\n  for f in $(ls -v ostree-*-fedora-coreos.conf | head -n -1); do\n      if ! grep -q grub_users \"$f\"; then\n          echo grub_users \"\" >> \"$f\";\n      fi;\n  done'\n  ```\n- A service was added to retroactively fix the `grub_users` setting on first boot after an upgrade if an affected release is detected. This migration script was removed after a barrier release.\n\n**Additional Details**\n\nThe content provides more detail than the official CVE description, including:\n\n- Specific affected and fixed versions of Fedora CoreOS.\n- Manual commands to mitigate the issue.\n- Explanation of the problematic conditional statement in `coreos-assembler`.\n- Information regarding a migration script added to address the vulnerability.\n- Links to the relevant commits and pull requests that fixed the issue.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.706 |\n| 2 | 214 | Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.570 |\n| 3 | 276 | Incorrect Default Permissions | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.530 |\n| 4 | 923 | Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.506 |\n| 5 | 88 | Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.501 |\n| 6 | 1193 | Power-On of Untrusted Execution Core Before Enabling Fabric Access Control | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.468 |\n| 7 | 322 | Key Exchange without Entity Authentication | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 287 | Improper Authentication | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.500 |\n| 9 | 201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.481 |\n| 10 | 1188 | Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.479 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-77\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** At one layer of abstraction, this can overlap other weaknesses that have whitespace problems, e.g. injection of javascript into attributes of HTML tags.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-36069:** Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n- **CVE-1999-0113:** Canonical Example - \"-froot\" argument is passed on to another program, where the \"-f\" causes execution as user \"root\"\n- **CVE-2001-0150:** Web browser executes Telnet sessions using command line arguments that are specified by the web site, which could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1193: Power-On of Untrusted Execution Core Before Enabling Fabric Access Control\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product enables components that contain untrusted firmware before memory and fabric access controls have been enabled.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\n After initial reset, System-on-Chip (SoC) fabric access controls and other security features need to be programmed by trusted firmware as part of the boot sequence. If untrusted IPs or peripheral microcontrollers are enabled first, then the untrusted component can master transactions on the hardware bus and target memory or other assets to compromise the SoC boot firmware.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-696\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This may enable an attacker to impersonate an actor by modifying traffic between the two entities. Typically, this involves a victim client that contacts a malicious server that is impersonating a trusted server. If the client skips authentication or ignores an authentication failure, the malicious server may request authentication information from the user. The malicious server can then use this authentication information to log in to the trusted server using the victim's credentials, sniff traffic between the victim and trusted server, etc.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-306\nCanPrecede -> CWE-923\nPeerOf -> CWE-295\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

It is also distinct from \"AuthZ,\" which is an abbreviation of \"authorization.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\nAuthC: \"AuthC\" is used as an abbreviation of \"authentication,\" but it appears to used less frequently than \"AuthN.\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication\n- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.\n- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-209\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-202\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

    "enhanced_query": "## Vulnerability Description\nFedora CoreOS supports setting a GRUB bootloader password using a Butane config. When this feature is enabled, GRUB requires a password to access the GRUB command-line, modify kernel command-line arguments, or boot non-default OSTree deployments. Recent Fedora CoreOS releases have a **misconfiguration** which allows booting non-default OSTree deployments without entering a password. This allows someone with access to the GRUB menu to boot into an older version of Fedora CoreOS, reverting any security fixes that have recently been applied to the machine. A password is still required to modify kernel command-line arguments and to access the GRUB command line.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **misconfiguration**\n- **impact:** boot non-default OSTree deployments without password\n- **product:** Fedora CoreOS\n- **version:** recent releases\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-3675:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- A misconfiguration in recent Fedora CoreOS releases, specifically in how the `sysroot.bls-append-except-default` option was being set within the OSTree configuration. The conditional statement used to set the `sysroot.bls-append-except-default` option in `coreos-assembler` was invalid, causing the option to not be set in affected builds. This option is responsible for restricting the boot of non-default OSTree deployments to only authorized users, by specifying the `grub_users` parameter in the BLS configuration files.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- Incorrect configuration of the `sysroot.bls-append-except-default` option, which controls access to non-default OSTree deployments via GRUB.\n- The conditional statement in `coreos-assembler` that was supposed to set the `sysroot.bls-append-except-default` value failed due to invalid syntax.\n- Consequently, the `grub_users` setting was not being added to the non-default BLS configuration files.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- An attacker with access to the GRUB menu can bypass the GRUB password protection and boot into non-default OSTree deployments (older versions of Fedora CoreOS) without providing the required password. This allows the attacker to bypass security fixes applied to the system.\n- The attacker cannot modify kernel command-line arguments or access the GRUB command line without the correct password.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- Physical access to the system or access to the GRUB menu through other means, such as a remote console.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker must have the ability to access the GRUB menu during system boot.\n- A basic knowledge of how to navigate the GRUB menu to select a non-default deployment is also required.\n\n**Affected Releases**\n- `stable` 36.20220820.3.0 and later\n- `testing` 36.20220906.2.0 and later\n- `next` 36.20220906.1.0 and later\n\n**Mitigation:**\n- The vulnerability is fixed in the following releases:\n  - `stable` 36.20221014.3.0 (new machines), 36.20221030.3.0 (existing machines)\n  - `testing` 36.20221030.2.0 (new and existing machines)\n  - `next` 37.20221031.1.0 (new and existing machines)\n- A manual fix for affected machines involves running the commands:\n  ```\n  sudo ostree config set sysroot.bls-append-except-default 'grub_users=\"\"'\n  sudo unshare -mw /boot/loader/entries bash -c \\\n  'mount -o rw,remount /boot &&\n  for f in $(ls -v ostree-*-fedora-coreos.conf | head -n -1); do\n      if ! grep -q grub_users \"$f\"; then\n          echo grub_users \"\" >> \"$f\";\n      fi;\n  done'\n  ```\n- A service was added to retroactively fix the `grub_users` setting on first boot after an upgrade if an affected release is detected. This migration script was removed after a barrier release.\n\n**Additional Details**\n\nThe content provides more detail than the official CVE description, including:\n\n- Specific affected and fixed versions of Fedora CoreOS.\n- Manual commands to mitigate the issue.\n- Explanation of the problematic conditional statement in `coreos-assembler`.\n- Information regarding a migration script added to address the vulnerability.\n- Links to the relevant commits and pull requests that fixed the issue.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.706 |\n| 2 | 214 | Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.570 |\n| 3 | 276 | Incorrect Default Permissions | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.530 |\n| 4 | 923 | Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.506 |\n| 5 | 88 | Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.501 |\n| 6 | 1193 | Power-On of Untrusted Execution Core Before Enabling Fabric Access Control | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.468 |\n| 7 | 322 | Key Exchange without Entity Authentication | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 287 | Improper Authentication | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.500 |\n| 9 | 201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.481 |\n| 10 | 1188 | Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.479 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

It is also distinct from \"AuthZ,\" which is an abbreviation of \"authorization.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\nAuthC: \"AuthC\" is used as an abbreviation of \"authentication,\" but it appears to used less frequently than \"AuthN.\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication\n- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.\n- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-209\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-202\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** Sensitive information could include data that is sensitive in and of itself (such as credentials or private messages), or otherwise useful in the further exploitation of the system (such as internal file system structure).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nDevelopers often choose default values that leave the product as open and easy to use as possible out-of-the-box, under the assumption that the administrator can (or should) change the default value. However, this ease-of-use comes at a cost when the default is insecure and the administrator does not change it.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1419\nChildOf -> CWE-665\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry improves organization of concepts under initialization. The typical CWE model is to cover \"Missing\" and \"Incorrect\" behaviors. Arguably, this entry could be named as \"Incorrect\" instead of \"Insecure.\" This might be changed in the near future.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-36349:** insecure default variable initialization in BIOS firmware for a hardware board allows DoS\n- **CVE-2022-42467:** A generic database browser interface has a default mode that exposes a web server to the network, allowing queries to the database.\n\n Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-923 CWE-306 CWE-807 CWE-665 CWE-88 CWE-1188 CWE-287 CWE-345 CWE-1391 CWE-863",
