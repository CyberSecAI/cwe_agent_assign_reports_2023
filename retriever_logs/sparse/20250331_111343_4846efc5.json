Versions prior to 4.9.1 expose a limited ability to spoof SAML authentication with **missing audience verification**. This impacts deployments using SAML SSO in two specific cases 1. A malicious or compromised Service Provider (SP) could reuse the SAML response to log into Fleet as a user -- only if the user has an account with the same email in Fleet, _and_ the user signs into the malicious SP via SAML SSO from the same Identity Provider (IdP) configured with Fleet. 2. A user with an account in Fleet could reuse a SAML response intended for another SP to log into Fleet. This is only a concern if the user is blocked from Fleet in the IdP, but continues to have an account in Fleet. If the user is blocked from the IdP entirely, this cannot be exploited. Fleet 4.9.1 resolves this issue. Users unable to upgrade should Reduce the length of sessions on your IdP to reduce the window for malicious re-use, Limit the amount of SAML Service Providers/Applications used by user accounts with access to Fleet, and When removing access to Fleet in the IdP, delete the Fleet user from Fleet as well.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **missing audience verification**\n- **impact:** spoof SAML authentication\n- **product:** fleet\n- **version:** prior to 4.9.1\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23600:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from a lack of proper audience validation in the SAML authentication process within Fleet. Specifically, the application did not verify that the SAML response was intended for it, which could allow a malicious or compromised Service Provider (SP) or a user to reuse a SAML response for unauthorized access.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Missing Audience Verification:** The core issue is the absence of a check to ensure the SAML response's `Audience` claim matches the expected entity ID of the Fleet service, or the lack of any audience verification. This allows for replay attacks and cross-SP authentication issues.\n*   **Improper SAML Response Handling**: The application did not sufficiently validate that a SAML response was intended for it, allowing for replay and other attacks.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **SAML Response Replay:** A malicious SP could reuse a valid SAML response obtained from a user to log into Fleet as that same user, provided the user's email is the same across the malicious SP and Fleet.\n*   **Cross-SP Authentication:** A user with an account on Fleet could potentially reuse a SAML response intended for another service provider to log into Fleet. This is a risk if the user is blocked on the IdP but still has an account within the Fleet application.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Malicious or Compromised Service Provider:** A malicious SP that shares an IdP with Fleet could capture and reuse SAML responses.\n*   **User Reusing SAML Response:** A user with an account in Fleet could attempt to use a SAML response intended for another SP.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Malicious SP Scenario:** An attacker needs to control or compromise a service provider that is configured to use the same Identity Provider (IdP) as the Fleet instance. They also need a valid SAML response issued by the IdP for a Fleet user.\n*   **User Reusing SAML Scenario:** The attacker needs a valid SAML response intended for another service, and the targeted Fleet user must be blocked from the IdP but still have a user account in the Fleet instance.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is addressed in Fleet version 4.9.1.\n*   The vulnerability is described as \"Limited ability to spoof SAML authentication with missing audience verification\"\n*   The advisory recommends reducing the length of sessions on IdP, limiting the number of SAML SPs used by Fleet users, and deleting users from Fleet when access is removed from the IdP.\n*   The fix involved adding audience validation to SAML responses in the `server/sso/validate.go` file, using `WithExpectedAudience` option. It also adds test coverage to ensure the audience validation is working as intended.\n\nThis information provides a more detailed understanding of the vulnerability than the placeholder CVE description.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 1390 | Weak Authentication | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 1.999 |\n| 2 | 431 | Missing Handler | Base | Allowed | sparse | 1.207 |\n| 3 | 347 | Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature | Base | Allowed | sparse | 1.167 |\n| 4 | 287 | Improper Authentication | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 1.099 |\n| 5 | 798 | Use of Hard-coded Credentials | Base | Allowed | sparse | 1.095 |\n| 6 | 488 | Exposure of Data Element to Wrong Session | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.434 |\n| 7 | 567 | Unsynchronized Access to Shared Data in a Multithreaded Context | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 303 | Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm | Base | Allowed | sparse | 1.073 |\n| 9 | 290 | Authentication Bypass by Spoofing | Base | Allowed | sparse | 1.068 |\n| 10 | 1270 | Generation of Incorrect Security Tokens | Base | Allowed | sparse | 1.061 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAttackers may be able to bypass weak authentication faster and/or with less effort than expected.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).\n- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication\n- **CVE-2021-3116:** Chain: Python-based HTTP Proxy server uses the wrong boolean operators (CWE-480) causing an incorrect comparison (CWE-697) that identifies an authN failure if all three conditions are met instead of only one, allowing bypass of the proxy authentication (CWE-1390)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-431: Missing Handler\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA handler is not available or implemented.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen an exception is thrown and not caught, the process has given up an opportunity to decide if a given failure or event is worth a change in execution.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-691\nCanPrecede -> CWE-433\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

In this variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. It can also be difficult for the administrator to detect.\n\n  - Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component. This variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password that can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1391\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-344\nChildOf -> CWE-671\nPeerOf -> CWE-257\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

A common result is that developers use Servlet member fields in such a way that one user may inadvertently see another user's data. In other words, storing user data in Servlet member fields introduces a data access race condition.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This is a typical programming mistake in J2EE applications, since the multithreading is handled by the framework. When a shared variable can be influenced by an attacker, one thread could wind up modifying the variable to contain data that is not valid for a different thread that is also using the data within the variable.\n\n\nNote that this weakness is not unique to servlets.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-820\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nCanPrecede -> CWE-488\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

However, the Security Tokens generated in the system are incorrect.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nSystems-On-a-Chip (SoC) (Integrated circuits and hardware engines) implement Security Tokens to differentiate and identify actions originated from various agents. These actions could be \"read\", \"write\", \"program\", \"reset\", \"fetch\", \"compute\", etc. Security Tokens are generated and assigned to every agent on the SoC that is either capable of generating an action or receiving an action from another agent. Every agent could be assigned a unique, Security Token based on its trust level or privileges. Incorrectly generated Security Tokens could result in the same token used for multiple agents or multiple tokens being used for the same agent. This condition could result in a Denial-of-Service (DoS) or the execution of an action that in turn could result in privilege escalation or unintended access.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nChildOf -> CWE-1294\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
