In systeminformation before version 5.3.1 there is a **command injection** vulnerability. Problem was fixed in version 5.3.1. As a workaround instead of upgrading, be sure to check or sanitize service parameters that are passed to si.inetLatency(), si.inetChecksite(), si.services(), si.processLoad() ... do only allow strings, reject any arrays. String sanitation works as expected.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **improper input sanitization**\n- **weakness:** **command injection**\n- **impact:** execute arbitrary commands\n- **product:** systeminformation\n- **version:** before 5.3.1\n- **component:** si.inetLatency() and si.inetChecksite() and si.services() and si.processLoad()\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21315:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw present in the `systeminformation` npm package, specifically in versions prior to 5.3.1. This flaw is triggered when the library doesn't properly sanitize input parameters, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the underlying operating system.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Command Injection:** The core weakness is the lack of proper sanitization of input parameters passed to functions like `si.inetLatency()`, `si.inetChecksite()`, `si.services()`, and `si.processLoad()`.\n*   **Inadequate Input Validation:**  The code fails to validate if the input is a string, and instead accepts array type parameters, which is later used in a shell command.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:\n\n*   **Disclosure of sensitive information:** An attacker could execute commands to access and exfiltrate sensitive data from the system.\n*   **Addition or modification of data:**  An attacker could alter files or configuration, potentially causing significant damage.\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could execute commands that consume system resources or disrupt services, leading to a denial-of-service condition.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Application Logic:** The attacker would need to control the parameters of the vulnerable functions. These functions include `inetLatency()`, `inetChecksite()`, `services()`, and `processLoad()`.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Code Injection Point:** The attacker needs a way to supply malicious input (e.g., an array instead of a string) to the affected functions. This often requires control over input parameters in the Node.js application using the vulnerable `systeminformation` library.\n*   **Execution Context:** The injected commands execute with the privileges of the Node.js process.\n*   **Local Network:**  This vulnerability can be exploited locally, since the vulnerable function does not require remote access.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was addressed in version 5.3.1 of the `systeminformation` package with improved parameter checks.\n*   A workaround exists for systems that cannot upgrade, which involves sanitizing the input parameters that are passed to the affected functions by only allowing strings and rejecting arrays.\n*   The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2021-21315 and is categorized as CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command).\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 77 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') | Class | Allowed-with-Review | alternate_terms | 1.000 |\n| 2 | 78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | Base | Allowed | alternate_terms | 0.700 |\n| 3 | 138 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.429 |\n| 4 | 1333 | Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.424 |\n| 5 | 88 | Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.413 |\n| 6 | 94 | Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') | Base | Allowed-with-Review | dense | 0.411 |\n| 7 | 41 | Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.385 |\n| 9 | 116 | Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.378 |\n| 10 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.377 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of a command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany protocols and products have their own custom command language. While OS or shell command strings are frequently discovered and targeted, developers may not realize that these other command languages might also be vulnerable to attacks.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nCommand injection: an attack-oriented phrase for this weakness. Note: often used when \"OS command injection\" (CWE-78) was intended.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-74\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** CWE-77 is often misused when OS command injection (CWE-78) was intended instead [REF-1287].\n**Comments:** Ensure that the analysis focuses on the root-cause error that allows the execution of commands, as there are many weaknesses that can lead to this consequence. See Terminology Notes. If the weakness involves a command language besides OS shell invocation, then CWE-77 could be used.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-78: OS Command Injection\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nThe \"command injection\" phrase carries different meanings, either as an attack or as a technical impact. The most common usage of \"command injection\" refers to the more-accurate OS command injection (CWE-78), but there are many command languages.\n\n\nIn vulnerability-focused analysis, the phrase may refer to any situation in which the adversary can execute commands of their own choosing, i.e., the focus is on the risk and/or technical impact of exploitation. Many proof-of-concept exploits focus on the ability to execute commands and may emphasize \"command injection.\" However, there are dozens of weaknesses that can allow execution of commands. That is, the ability to execute commands could be resultant from another weakness.\n\n\nTo some, \"command injection\" can include cases in which the functionality intentionally allows the user to specify an entire command, which is then executed. In this case, the root cause weakness might be related to missing or incorrect authorization, since an adversary should not be able to specify arbitrary commands, but some users or admins are allowed.\n\n\nCWE-77 and its descendants are specifically focused on behaviors in which the product is intentionally building a command to execute, and the adversary can inject separators into the command or otherwise change the command being executed.\n\n\n**[Other]** \n\nCommand injection is a common problem with wrapper programs.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-1509:** injection of sed script syntax (\"sed injection\")\n- **CVE-2024-5184:** API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.\n- **CVE-2020-11698:** anti-spam product allows injection of SNMP commands into confiuration file\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nShell injection\nShell metacharacters\nOS Command Injection\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-88\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** The \"OS command injection\" phrase carries different meanings to different people. For some people, it only refers to cases in which the attacker injects command separators into arguments for an application-controlled program that is being invoked. For some people, it refers to any type of attack that can allow the attacker to execute OS commands of their own choosing. This usage could include untrusted search path weaknesses (CWE-426) that cause the application to find and execute an attacker-controlled program. Further complicating the issue is the case when argument injection (CWE-88) allows alternate command-line switches or options to be inserted into the command line, such as an \"-exec\" switch whose purpose may be to execute the subsequent argument as a command (this -exec switch exists in the UNIX \"find\" command, for example). In this latter case, however, CWE-88 could be regarded as the primary weakness in a chain with CWE-78.\n\n**[Research Gap]** More investigation is needed into the distinction between the OS command injection variants, including the role with argument injection (CWE-88). Equivalent distinctions may exist in other injection-related problems such as SQL injection.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-10987:** OS command injection in Wi-Fi router, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-10221:** Template functionality in network configuration management tool allows OS command injection, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-9054:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in username parameter, leading to OS command injection (CWE-78), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\nMost languages and protocols have their own special elements such as characters and reserved words. These special elements can carry control implications. If product does not prevent external control or influence over the inclusion of such special elements, the control flow of the program may be altered from what was intended. For example, both Unix and Windows interpret the symbol < (\"less than\") as meaning \"read input from a file\".\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness can be related to interpretation conflicts or interaction errors in intermediaries (such as proxies or application firewalls) when the intermediary's model of an endpoint does not account for protocol-specific special elements.\n\n**[Relationship]** See this entry's children for different types of special elements that have been observed at one point or another. However, it can be difficult to find suitable CVE examples. In an attempt to be complete, CWE includes some types that do not have any associated observed example.\n\n**[Research Gap]** This weakness is probably under-studied for proprietary or custom formats. It is likely that these issues are fairly common in applications that use their own custom format for configuration files, logs, meta-data, messaging, etc. They would only be found by accident or with a focused effort based on an understanding of the format.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-0677:** Read arbitrary files from mail client by providing a special MIME header that is internally used to store pathnames for attachments.\n- **CVE-2000-0703:** Setuid program does not cleanse special escape sequence before sending data to a mail program, causing the mail program to process those sequences.\n- **CVE-2003-0020:** Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.\n\n### Extended Description\nSome regular expression engines have a feature called \"backtracking\". If the token cannot match, the engine \"backtracks\" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.\n Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:\n\n\n  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.\n\n  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.\n\n  - The input can be long enough.\n\n Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. \n\n### Alternative Terms\nReDoS: ReDoS is an abbreviation of \"Regular expression Denial of Service\".\nRegular Expression Denial of Service: While this term is attack-focused, this is commonly used to describe the weakness.\nCatastrophic backtracking: This term is used to describe the behavior of the regular expression as a negative technical impact.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-407\nChildOf -> CWE-407\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-5243:** server allows ReDOS with crafted User-Agent strings, due to overlapping capture groups that cause excessive backtracking.\n- **CVE-2021-21317:** npm package for user-agent parser prone to ReDoS due to overlapping capture groups\n- **CVE-2019-16215:** Markdown parser uses inefficient regex when processing a message, allowing users to cause CPU consumption and delay preventing processing of other messages.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen creating commands using interpolation into a string, developers may assume that only the arguments/options that they specify will be processed. This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-77\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** At one layer of abstraction, this can overlap other weaknesses that have whitespace problems, e.g. injection of javascript into attributes of HTML tags.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-36069:** Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n- **CVE-1999-0113:** Canonical Example - \"-froot\" argument is passed on to another program, where the \"-f\" causes execution as user \"root\"\n- **CVE-2001-0150:** Web browser executes Telnet sessions using command line arguments that are specified by the web site, which could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen a product allows a user's input to contain code syntax, it might be possible for an attacker to craft the code in such a way that it will alter the intended control flow of the product. Such an alteration could lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nInjection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-913\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This entry is frequently misused for vulnerabilities with a technical impact of \"code execution,\" which does not by itself indicate a root cause weakness, since dozens of weaknesses can enable code execution.\n**Comments:** This weakness only applies when the product's functionality intentionally constructs all or part of a code segment. It could be that executing code could be the result of other weaknesses that do not involve the construction of code segments.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n- Frequent Misinterpretation\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-29374:** Math component in an LLM framework translates user input into a Python expression that is input into the Python exec() method, allowing code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n- **CVE-2024-5565:** Python-based library uses an LLM prompt containing user input to dynamically generate code that is then fed as input into the Python exec() method, allowing code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n- **CVE-2024-4181:** Framework for LLM applications allows eval injection via a crafted response from a hosting provider.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n\n### Extended Description\nPath equivalence is usually employed in order to circumvent access controls expressed using an incomplete set of file name or file path representations. This is different from path traversal, wherein the manipulations are performed to generate a name for a different object.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Some of these manipulations could be effective in path traversal issues, too.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2000-1114:** Source code disclosure using trailing dot\n- **CVE-2002-1986:** Source code disclosure using trailing dot\n- **CVE-2004-2213:** Source code disclosure using trailing dot or trailing encoding space \"%20\"\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-209\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-202\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** Sensitive information could include data that is sensitive in and of itself (such as credentials or private messages), or otherwise useful in the further exploitation of the system (such as internal file system structure).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nImproper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.\n\n\nMost products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, \"GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\" is a structured message containing a command (\"GET\") with a single argument (\"/index.html\") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (\"HTTP/1.1\").\n\n\nIf an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOutput Sanitization\nOutput Validation\nOutput Encoding\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\nCanPrecede -> CWE-74\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness is primary to all weaknesses related to injection (CWE-74) since the inherent nature of injection involves the violation of structured messages.\n\n**[Relationship]** \n\nCWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.\n\n\nHowever, input validation is not always sufficient, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a last name is inserted into a query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise neutralized. In this case, stripping the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.\n\n\n**[Terminology]** The usage of the \"encoding\" and \"escaping\" terms varies widely. For example, in some programming languages, the terms are used interchangeably, while other languages provide APIs that use both terms for different tasks. This overlapping usage extends to the Web, such as the \"escape\" JavaScript function whose purpose is stated to be encoding. The concepts of encoding and escaping predate the Web by decades. Given such a context, it is difficult for CWE to adopt a consistent vocabulary that will not be misinterpreted by some constituency.\n\n**[Theoretical]** This is a data/directive boundary error in which data boundaries are not sufficiently enforced before it is sent to a different control sphere.\n\n**[Research Gap]** While many published vulnerabilities are related to insufficient output encoding, there is such an emphasis on input validation as a protection mechanism that the underlying causes are rarely described. Within CVE, the focus is primarily on well-understood issues like cross-site scripting and SQL injection. It is likely that this weakness frequently occurs in custom protocols that support multiple encodings, which are not necessarily detectable with automated techniques.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-41232:** Chain: authentication routine in Go-based agile development product does not escape user name (CWE-116), allowing LDAP injection (CWE-90)\n- **CVE-2008-4636:** OS command injection in backup software using shell metacharacters in a filename; correct behavior would require that this filename could not be changed.\n- **CVE-2008-0769:** Web application does not set the charset when sending a page to a browser, allowing for XSS exploitation when a browser chooses an unexpected encoding.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.\n- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default \"Allow\" configuration for its authorization settings.\n\n",
