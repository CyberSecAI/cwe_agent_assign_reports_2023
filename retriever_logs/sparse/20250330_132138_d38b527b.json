The plugin fails to verify if a user is authorized to modify another user's avatar. It also doesn't ensure the uniqueness of filenames, enabling overwriting of existing avatars.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The vulnerability allows a user to directly manipulate another user's avatar by exploiting predictable filenames and the lack of authorization checks.\n*   **Broken Access Control:** The plugin does not implement proper authorization checks to verify whether a user is permitted to modify another user's avatar.\n*   **Lack of Filename Uniqueness:** The plugin does not enforce unique filenames for user avatars, resulting in the ability of one user to overwrite the avatar of another by uploading an avatar with the same name.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **User Avatar Override:** A logged-in user, even with minimal privileges (Subscriber+), can replace another user's avatar with their own. This can lead to defacement of profiles.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   The attack vector is through the user avatar upload mechanism.\n*   An attacker needs to be a logged-in user (Subscriber+) on the WordPress site.\n*   The attacker identifies the target user's avatar file URL by inspecting the user\u2019s profile image. The attacker then uploads a file using the same naming convention.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   The attacker must have a user account with at least Subscriber level privileges on the target WordPress site.\n*   The attacker must be able to upload a new avatar using the plugin's functionality.\n*   The attacker must be able to access the image URLs of other users' avatars to identify the name of the files.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.282 |\n| 2 | 352 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | Compound | Allowed | sparse | 0.258 |\n| 3 | 862 | Missing Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.249 |\n| 4 | 306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.234 |\n| 5 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.224 |\n| 6 | 286 | Incorrect User Management | Class | Allowed-with-Review | dense | 0.442 |\n| 7 | 613 | Insufficient Session Expiration | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 285 | Improper Authorization | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.223 |\n| 9 | 116 | Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.220 |\n| 10 | 22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.216 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nRetrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.\n\n\nFor example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.\n\n\nOne manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nInsecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The \"Insecure Direct Object Reference\" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.\nBroken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.\nHorizontal Authorization: \"Horizontal Authorization\" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-863\nChildOf -> CWE-863\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-36539:** An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction:** Compound\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a web server is designed to receive a request from a client without any mechanism for verifying that it was intentionally sent, then it might be possible for an attacker to trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server which will be treated as an authentic request. This can be done via a URL, image load, XMLHttpRequest, etc. and can result in exposure of data or unintended code execution.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nSession Riding\nCross Site Reference Forgery\nXSRF\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nRequires -> CWE-346\nRequires -> CWE-441\nRequires -> CWE-642\nRequires -> CWE-613\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n**Comments:** While attack-oriented composites are supported in CWE, they have not been a focus of research. There is a chance that future research or CWE scope clarifications will change or deprecate them. Perform root-cause analysis to determine if other weaknesses allow CSRF attacks to occur, and map to those weaknesses. For example, predictable CSRF tokens might allow bypass of CSRF protection mechanisms; if this occurs, they might be better characterized as randomness/predictability weaknesses.\n**Reasons:**\n- Other\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThere can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.\n\n\n**[Theoretical]** \n\nThe CSRF topology is multi-channel:\n\n\n  - Attacker (as outsider) to intermediary (as user). The interaction point is either an external or internal channel.\n\n  - Intermediary (as user) to server (as victim). The activation point is an internal channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2004-1703:** Add user accounts via a URL in an img tag\n- **CVE-2004-1995:** Add user accounts via a URL in an img tag\n- **CVE-2004-1967:** Arbitrary code execution by specifying the code in a crafted img tag or URL\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community.

One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).\n\n**[Maintenance]** This item needs more work. Possible sub-categories include: user in wrong group, and user with insecure profile or \"configuration\". It also might be better expressed as a category than a weakness.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-36109:** Containerization product does not record a user's supplementary group ID, allowing bypass of group restrictions.\n- **CVE-1999-1193:** Operating system assigns user to privileged wheel group, allowing the user to gain root privileges.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nAccording to WASC, \"Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization.\"\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nCanPrecede -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\nWhen access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information\n- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.\n- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nImproper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.\n\n\nMost products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, \"GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\" is a structured message containing a command (\"GET\") with a single argument (\"/index.html\") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (\"HTTP/1.1\").\n\n\nIf an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOutput Sanitization\nOutput Validation\nOutput Encoding\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\nCanPrecede -> CWE-74\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness is primary to all weaknesses related to injection (CWE-74) since the inherent nature of injection involves the violation of structured messages.\n\n**[Relationship]** \n\nCWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.\n\n\nHowever, input validation is not always sufficient, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a last name is inserted into a query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise neutralized. In this case, stripping the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.\n\n\n**[Terminology]** The usage of the \"encoding\" and \"escaping\" terms varies widely. For example, in some programming languages, the terms are used interchangeably, while other languages provide APIs that use both terms for different tasks. This overlapping usage extends to the Web, such as the \"escape\" JavaScript function whose purpose is stated to be encoding. The concepts of encoding and escaping predate the Web by decades. Given such a context, it is difficult for CWE to adopt a consistent vocabulary that will not be misinterpreted by some constituency.\n\n**[Theoretical]** This is a data/directive boundary error in which data boundaries are not sufficiently enforced before it is sent to a different control sphere.\n\n**[Research Gap]** While many published vulnerabilities are related to insufficient output encoding, there is such an emphasis on input validation as a protection mechanism that the underlying causes are rarely described. Within CVE, the focus is primarily on well-understood issues like cross-site scripting and SQL injection. It is likely that this weakness frequently occurs in custom protocols that support multiple encodings, which are not necessarily detectable with automated techniques.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-41232:** Chain: authentication routine in Go-based agile development product does not escape user name (CWE-116), allowing LDAP injection (CWE-90)\n- **CVE-2008-4636:** OS command injection in backup software using shell metacharacters in a filename; correct behavior would require that this filename could not be changed.\n- **CVE-2008-0769:** Web application does not set the charset when sending a page to a browser, allowing for XSS exploitation when a browser chooses an unexpected encoding.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDirectory traversal\nPath traversal: \"Path traversal\" is preferred over \"directory traversal,\" but both terms are attack-focused.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add \".txt\" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.\n\n**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.\n\n**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing \"/\" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nLike other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use \"directory traversal\" only to refer to the injection of \"..\" and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.\n\n\nOther variants like \"absolute pathname\" and \"drive letter\" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve \"..\" or equivalent.\n\n\n**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.\n\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nIncomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that \"..\\\" is vulnerable, but not test \"../\" which may also be vulnerable.\n\n\nAny combination of directory separators (\"/\", \"\\\", etc.) and numbers of \".\" (e.g. \"....\") can produce unique variants; for example, the \"//../\" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama\n- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the \"\\\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n\n",

The attacker then uploads a file using the same naming convention.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   The attacker must have a user account with at least Subscriber level privileges on the target WordPress site.\n*   The attacker must be able to upload a new avatar using the plugin's functionality.\n*   The attacker must be able to access the image URLs of other users' avatars to identify the name of the files.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.282 |\n| 2 | 352 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | Compound | Allowed | sparse | 0.258 |\n| 3 | 862 | Missing Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.249 |\n| 4 | 306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.234 |\n| 5 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.224 |\n| 6 | 286 | Incorrect User Management | Class | Allowed-with-Review | dense | 0.442 |\n| 7 | 613 | Insufficient Session Expiration | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 285 | Improper Authorization | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.223 |\n| 9 | 116 | Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.220 |\n| 10 | 22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.216 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nRetrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.\n\n\nFor example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.\n\n\nOne manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nInsecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The \"Insecure Direct Object Reference\" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.\nBroken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.\nHorizontal Authorization: \"Horizontal Authorization\" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-863\nChildOf -> CWE-863\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-36539:** An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction:** Compound\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a web server is designed to receive a request from a client without any mechanism for verifying that it was intentionally sent, then it might be possible for an attacker to trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server which will be treated as an authentic request. This can be done via a URL, image load, XMLHttpRequest, etc. and can result in exposure of data or unintended code execution.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nSession Riding\nCross Site Reference Forgery\nXSRF\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nRequires -> CWE-346\nRequires -> CWE-441\nRequires -> CWE-642\nRequires -> CWE-613\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n**Comments:** While attack-oriented composites are supported in CWE, they have not been a focus of research. There is a chance that future research or CWE scope clarifications will change or deprecate them. Perform root-cause analysis to determine if other weaknesses allow CSRF attacks to occur, and map to those weaknesses. For example, predictable CSRF tokens might allow bypass of CSRF protection mechanisms; if this occurs, they might be better characterized as randomness/predictability weaknesses.\n**Reasons:**\n- Other\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThere can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.\n\n\n**[Theoretical]** \n\nThe CSRF topology is multi-channel:\n\n\n  - Attacker (as outsider) to intermediary (as user). The interaction point is either an external or internal channel.\n\n  - Intermediary (as user) to server (as victim). The activation point is an internal channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2004-1703:** Add user accounts via a URL in an img tag\n- **CVE-2004-1995:** Add user accounts via a URL in an img tag\n- **CVE-2004-1967:** Arbitrary code execution by specifying the code in a crafted img tag or URL\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community.

One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).\n\n**[Maintenance]** This item needs more work. Possible sub-categories include: user in wrong group, and user with insecure profile or \"configuration\". It also might be better expressed as a category than a weakness.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-36109:** Containerization product does not record a user's supplementary group ID, allowing bypass of group restrictions.\n- **CVE-1999-1193:** Operating system assigns user to privileged wheel group, allowing the user to gain root privileges.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nAccording to WASC, \"Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization.\"\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nCanPrecede -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\nWhen access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information\n- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.\n- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nImproper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.\n\n\nMost products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, \"GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\" is a structured message containing a command (\"GET\") with a single argument (\"/index.html\") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (\"HTTP/1.1\").\n\n\nIf an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOutput Sanitization\nOutput Validation\nOutput Encoding\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\nCanPrecede -> CWE-74\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness is primary to all weaknesses related to injection (CWE-74) since the inherent nature of injection involves the violation of structured messages.\n\n**[Relationship]** \n\nCWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.\n\n\nHowever, input validation is not always sufficient, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a last name is inserted into a query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise neutralized. In this case, stripping the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.\n\n\n**[Terminology]** The usage of the \"encoding\" and \"escaping\" terms varies widely. For example, in some programming languages, the terms are used interchangeably, while other languages provide APIs that use both terms for different tasks. This overlapping usage extends to the Web, such as the \"escape\" JavaScript function whose purpose is stated to be encoding. The concepts of encoding and escaping predate the Web by decades. Given such a context, it is difficult for CWE to adopt a consistent vocabulary that will not be misinterpreted by some constituency.\n\n**[Theoretical]** This is a data/directive boundary error in which data boundaries are not sufficiently enforced before it is sent to a different control sphere.\n\n**[Research Gap]** While many published vulnerabilities are related to insufficient output encoding, there is such an emphasis on input validation as a protection mechanism that the underlying causes are rarely described. Within CVE, the focus is primarily on well-understood issues like cross-site scripting and SQL injection. It is likely that this weakness frequently occurs in custom protocols that support multiple encodings, which are not necessarily detectable with automated techniques.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-41232:** Chain: authentication routine in Go-based agile development product does not escape user name (CWE-116), allowing LDAP injection (CWE-90)\n- **CVE-2008-4636:** OS command injection in backup software using shell metacharacters in a filename; correct behavior would require that this filename could not be changed.\n- **CVE-2008-0769:** Web application does not set the charset when sending a page to a browser, allowing for XSS exploitation when a browser chooses an unexpected encoding.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDirectory traversal\nPath traversal: \"Path traversal\" is preferred over \"directory traversal,\" but both terms are attack-focused.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add \".txt\" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.\n\n**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.\n\n**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing \"/\" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nLike other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use \"directory traversal\" only to refer to the injection of \"..\" and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.\n\n\nOther variants like \"absolute pathname\" and \"drive letter\" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve \"..\" or equivalent.\n\n\n**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.\n\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nIncomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that \"..\\\" is vulnerable, but not test \"../\" which may also be vulnerable.\n\n\nAny combination of directory separators (\"/\", \"\\\", etc.) and numbers of \".\" (e.g. \"....\") can produce unique variants; for example, the \"//../\" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama\n- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the \"\\\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n\n"
