Prior to version 3.19.1, users can bypass a lock on the Nextcloud app on an Android device by repeatedly reopening the app. Version 3.19.1 contains a fix for the problem. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **impact:** bypass lock on Nextcloud app\n- **vector:** repeatedly reopening the app\n- **attacker:** users\n- **product:** Nextcloud Android app\n- **version:** prior to 3.19.1\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24885:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Nextcloud Android app's lock protection could be bypassed due to improper handling of activity lifecycle events when the app is reopened.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Improper implementation of the app lock mechanism\n- Insufficient handling of app activity lifecycle events (specifically, the transition from a paused or stopped state to active state)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Bypassing the app's lock protection mechanism\n- Potential unauthorized access to the user's data stored within the Nextcloud app\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Physical access to the device with the Nextcloud app installed\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- Physical access to the Android device\n- Ability to repeatedly open and close the Nextcloud app\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\nThe vulnerability arises from the app not correctly handling the lock screen when quickly reopening the app. The fix implemented in pull request #9816 involved changes to `PassCodeManager`, `AuthenticatorActivity`, and `PassCodeActivity` to ensure the lock is properly enforced and the app state is correctly tracked. Specifically the fix ensures the lock timestamp is updated and the activity counter is not incremented for activities such as the passcode screen to prevent repetition attacks.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 459 | Incomplete Cleanup | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.128 |\n| 2 | 1390 | Weak Authentication | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.127 |\n| 3 | 295 | Improper Certificate Validation | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.125 |\n| 4 | 209 | Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.119 |\n| 5 | 862 | Missing Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.115 |\n| 6 | 1021 | Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.356 |\n| 7 | 756 | Missing Custom Error Page | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 532 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.115 |\n| 9 | 201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.113 |\n| 10 | 93 | Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.112 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-459: Incomplete Cleanup\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly \"clean up\" and remove temporary or supporting resources after they have been used.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nInsufficient Cleanup\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-404\nChildOf -> CWE-404\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** CWE-459 is a child of CWE-404 because, while CWE-404 covers any type of improper shutdown or release of a resource, CWE-459 deals specifically with a multi-step shutdown process in which a crucial step for \"proper\" cleanup is omitted or impossible. That is, CWE-459 deals specifically with a cleanup or shutdown process that does not successfully remove all potentially sensitive data.\n\n**[Relationship]** Overlaps other categories such as permissions and containment. Concept needs further development. This could be primary (e.g. leading to infoleak) or resultant (e.g. resulting from unhandled error conditions or early termination).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2000-0552:** World-readable temporary file not deleted after use.\n- **CVE-2005-2293:** Temporary file not deleted after use, leaking database usernames and passwords.\n- **CVE-2002-0788:** Interaction error creates a temporary file that can not be deleted due to strong permissions.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAttackers may be able to bypass weak authentication faster and/or with less effort than expected.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).\n- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication\n- **CVE-2021-3116:** Chain: Python-based HTTP Proxy server uses the wrong boolean operators (CWE-480) causing an incorrect comparison (CWE-697) that identifies an authN failure if all three conditions are met instead of only one, allowing bypass of the proxy authentication (CWE-1390)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by interfering in the communication path between the host and client. The product might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the product might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nPeerOf -> CWE-322\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-12496:** A Go framework for robotics, drones, and IoT devices skips verification of root CA certificates by default.\n- **CVE-2014-1266:** chain: incorrect \"goto\" in Apple SSL product bypasses certificate validation, allowing Adversary-in-the-Middle (AITM) attack (Apple \"goto fail\" bug). CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).\n- **CVE-2021-22909:** Chain: router's firmware update procedure uses curl with \"-k\" (insecure) option that disables certificate validation (CWE-295), allowing adversary-in-the-middle (AITM) compromise with a malicious firmware image (CWE-494).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThe sensitive information may be valuable information on its own (such as a password), or it may be useful for launching other, more serious attacks. The error message may be created in different ways:\n\n\n  - self-generated: the source code explicitly constructs the error message and delivers it\n\n  - externally-generated: the external environment, such as a language interpreter, handles the error and constructs its own message, whose contents are not under direct control by the programmer\n\nAn attacker may use the contents of error messages to help launch another, more focused attack. For example, an attempt to exploit a path traversal weakness (CWE-22) might yield the full pathname of the installed application. In turn, this could be used to select the proper number of \"..\" sequences to navigate to the targeted file. An attack using SQL injection (CWE-89) might not initially succeed, but an error message could reveal the malformed query, which would expose query logic and possibly even passwords or other sensitive information used within the query.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nChildOf -> CWE-755\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Might be resultant from another weakness.\n- **CVE-2007-5172:** Program reveals password in error message if attacker can trigger certain database errors.\n- **CVE-2008-4638:** Composite: application running with high privileges (CWE-250) allows user to specify a restricted file to process, which generates a parsing error that leaks the contents of the file (CWE-209).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information\n- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.\n- **CVE-2009-3597:** Web application stores database file under the web root with insufficient access control (CWE-219), allowing direct request.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1021: Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe web application does not restrict or incorrectly restricts frame objects or UI layers that belong to another application or domain, which can lead to user confusion about which interface the user is interacting with.\n\n### Extended Description\nA web application is expected to place restrictions on whether it is allowed to be rendered within frames, iframes, objects, embed or applet elements. Without the restrictions, users can be tricked into interacting with the application when they were not intending to.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nClickjacking\nUI Redress Attack\nTapjacking: \"Tapjacking\" is similar to clickjacking, except it is used for mobile applications in which the user \"taps\" the application instead of performing a mouse click.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-441\nChildOf -> CWE-610\nChildOf -> CWE-451\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
