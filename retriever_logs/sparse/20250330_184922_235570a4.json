This is due to the combination of a **race condition**, **buffer overflow**, and **logic bug** all in PipeSocketHandlerlisten().\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'race condition'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1. CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (Score: 293.97)\n\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently....\n\n### 2. CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition (Score: 282.42)\n\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state....\n\n### 3. CWE-662: Improper Synchronization (Score: 259.91)\n\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes....\n\n### 4. CWE-277: Insecure Inherited Permissions (Score: 240.45)\n\nA product defines a set of insecure permissions that are inherited by objects that are created by the program....\n\n### 5.
