CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 265.68)\n\nA heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc()....\n\n### 2. CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size (Score: 256.29)\n\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow....\n\n### 3. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 249.30)\n\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to st...\n\n### 4. CWE-193: Off-by-one Error (Score: 241.10)\n\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value....\n\n### 5. CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read (Score: 235.78)\n\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....\n\n## WEAKNESS: 'out-of-bounds read'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1.

CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index (Score: 265.56)\n\nThe product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array....\n\n### 3. CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (Score: 261.39)\n\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data....\n\n### 4. CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size (Score: 256.29)\n\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow....\n\n### 5.
