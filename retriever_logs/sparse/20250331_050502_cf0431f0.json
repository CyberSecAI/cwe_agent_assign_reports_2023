Specifically, the `EfsRpcOpenFileRaw` function can be invoked anonymously, triggering an NTLM authentication request with the computer account of the requesting machine to an arbitrary host.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n1.  **NTLM Relay Vulnerability:** The core weakness is the ability to relay NTLM authentication requests from a domain-joined machine, including domain controllers, to arbitrary hosts. This is because the `EfsRpcOpenFileRaw` function, and potentially other methods, trigger authentication as the machine account, and this authentication can be relayed to other targets.\n2.  **Abuse of EFSRPC:** The EFSRPC interface, especially the `EfsRpcOpenFileRaw` function, can be used anonymously to initiate NTLM authentication to an arbitrary target.\n3.  **Default Behavior:** AD CS is vulnerable by default, making exploitation easier.\n4.  **Lack of Proper Authentication/Authorization:** The `EfsRpcOpenFileRaw` function can be invoked anonymously, bypassing authorization and authentication checks.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Active Directory Compromise:** By relaying an NTLM authentication request from a domain controller to AD CS, an attacker can obtain a certificate that can be used to get a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT). This \"Golden Ticket\" attack can lead to full compromise of the Active Directory infrastructure, granting the attacker complete control of the domain.\n*   **Lateral Movement:**  Attackers can move laterally using the machine account to compromise other systems on the network.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attack is network-based. The attacker must be on a system that is connected to an Active Directory Domain.\n*   **EFSRPC:** The attacker leverages the EFSRPC interface, specifically `EfsRpcOpenFileRaw`, to trigger NTLM authentication requests to a target host.\n*   **NTLM Relay:** The attacker relays the NTLM authentication from the system that made the request (often a domain controller) to an AD CS server.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Domain-Joined System:** The attacker needs to have a foothold on any machine that is joined to an Active Directory Domain.\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the AD CS server.\n*   **Knowledge of EFSRPC:** The attacker requires the understanding and capability to send a crafted EFSRPC request. This can be done using tools like PetitPotam.\n*   **Relay Capabilities:** The attacker needs tools to relay the NTLM authentication request to the target system.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n* The vulnerability is not limited to the PetitPotam exploit, as other methods may trigger privileged NTLM authentication to arbitrary hosts.\n* The provided update for CVE-2021-36942 only blocks the unauthenticated `EfsRpcOpenFileRaw` call but does not address other potential EFSRPC attacks.\n* Mitigation includes applying the update, enabling Extended Protection for Authentication (EPA), requiring SSL, disabling incoming NTLM, disabling the NTLM provider in IIS for AD CS, blocking the EFSRPC RPC interface, and disabling NTLM authentication in the domain.\n\nThis information is more detailed than the typical CVE description, and provides comprehensive information about the vulnerability and its exploitation.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 925 | Improper Verification of Intent by Broadcast Receiver | Variant | Allowed | alternate_terms | 0.700 |\n| 2 | 290 | Authentication Bypass by Spoofing | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.056 |\n| 3 | 297 | Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.038 |\n| 4 | 299 | Improper Check for Certificate Revocation | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.037 |\n| 5 | 358 | Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.036 |\n| 6 | 291 | Reliance on IP Address for Authentication | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.484 |\n| 7 | 370 | Missing Check for Certificate Revocation after Initial Check | Variant | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 295 | Improper Certificate Validation | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.035 |\n| 9 | 342 | Predictable Exact Value from Previous Values | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.035 |\n| 10 | 350 | Reliance on Reverse DNS Resolution for a Security-Critical Action | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.035 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-925: Improper Verification of Intent by Broadcast Receiver\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe Android application uses a Broadcast Receiver that receives an Intent but does not properly verify that the Intent came from an authorized source.\n\n### Extended Description\nCertain types of Intents, identified by action string, can only be broadcast by the operating system itself, not by third-party applications. However, when an application registers to receive these implicit system intents, it is also registered to receive any explicit intents. While a malicious application cannot send an implicit system intent, it can send an explicit intent to the target application, which may assume that any received intent is a valid implicit system intent and not an explicit intent from another application. This may lead to unintended behavior.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nIntent Spoofing\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-940\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry will be made more comprehensive in later CWE versions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThis attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\nChildOf -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from insufficient verification.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30319:** S-bus functionality in a home automation product performs access control using an IP allowlist, which can be bypassed by a forged IP address.\n- **CVE-2009-1048:** VOIP product allows authentication bypass using 127.0.0.1 in the Host header.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product communicates with a host that provides a certificate, but the product does not properly ensure that the certificate is actually associated with that host.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nEven if a certificate is well-formed, signed, and follows the chain of trust, it may simply be a valid certificate for a different site than the site that the product is interacting with. If the certificate's host-specific data is not properly checked - such as the Common Name (CN) in the Subject or the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension of an X.509 certificate - it may be possible for a redirection or spoofing attack to allow a malicious host with a valid certificate to provide data, impersonating a trusted host. In order to ensure data integrity, the certificate must be valid and it must pertain to the site that is being accessed.\n\n\nEven if the product attempts to check the hostname, it is still possible to incorrectly check the hostname. For example, attackers could create a certificate with a name that begins with a trusted name followed by a NUL byte, which could cause some string-based comparisons to only examine the portion that contains the trusted name.\n\n\nThis weakness can occur even when the product uses Certificate Pinning, if the product does not verify the hostname at the time a certificate is pinned.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-923\nChildOf -> CWE-295\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2012-5810:** Mobile banking application does not verify hostname, leading to financial loss.\n- **CVE-2012-5811:** Mobile application for printing documents does not verify hostname, allowing attackers to read sensitive documents.\n- **CVE-2012-5807:** Software for electronic checking does not verify hostname, leading to financial loss.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-299: Improper Check for Certificate Revocation\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks the revocation status of a certificate, which may cause it to use a certificate that has been compromised.\n\n### Extended Description\nAn improper check for certificate revocation is a far more serious flaw than related certificate failures. This is because the use of any revoked certificate is almost certainly malicious. The most common reason for certificate revocation is compromise of the system in question, with the result that no legitimate servers will be using a revoked certificate, unless they are sorely out of sync.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-295\nChildOf -> CWE-404\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2011-2014:** LDAP-over-SSL implementation does not check Certificate Revocation List (CRL), allowing spoofing using a revoked certificate.\n- **CVE-2011-0199:** Operating system does not check Certificate Revocation List (CRL) in some cases, allowing spoofing using a revoked certificate.\n- **CVE-2010-5185:** Antivirus product does not check whether certificates from signed executables have been revoked.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-358: Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not implement or incorrectly implements one or more security-relevant checks as specified by the design of a standardized algorithm, protocol, or technique.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-573\nChildOf -> CWE-693\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-345\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-290\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is a \"missing step\" error on the product side, which can overlap weaknesses such as insufficient verification and spoofing. It is frequently found in cryptographic and authentication errors. It is sometimes resultant.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-0862:** Browser does not verify Basic Constraints of a certificate, even though it is required, allowing spoofing of trusted certificates.\n- **CVE-2002-0970:** Browser does not verify Basic Constraints of a certificate, even though it is required, allowing spoofing of trusted certificates.\n- **CVE-2002-1407:** Browser does not verify Basic Constraints of a certificate, even though it is required, allowing spoofing of trusted certificates.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-291: Reliance on IP Address for Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses an IP address for authentication.\n\n### Extended Description\nIP addresses can be easily spoofed. Attackers can forge the source IP address of the packets they send, but response packets will return to the forged IP address. To see the response packets, the attacker has to sniff the traffic between the victim machine and the forged IP address. In order to accomplish the required sniffing, attackers typically attempt to locate themselves on the same subnet as the victim machine. Attackers may be able to circumvent this requirement by using source routing, but source routing is disabled across much of the Internet today. In summary, IP address verification can be a useful part of an authentication scheme, but it should not be the single factor required for authentication.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-290\nChildOf -> CWE-923\nChildOf -> CWE-471\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

If a certificate is revoked after the initial check, all subsequent actions taken with the owner of the revoked certificate will lose all benefits guaranteed by the certificate. In fact, it is almost certain that the use of a revoked certificate indicates malicious activity.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-299\nPeerOf -> CWE-296\nPeerOf -> CWE-297\nPeerOf -> CWE-298\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by interfering in the communication path between the host and client. The product might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the product might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nPeerOf -> CWE-322\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-12496:** A Go framework for robotics, drones, and IoT devices skips verification of root CA certificates by default.\n- **CVE-2014-1266:** chain: incorrect \"goto\" in Apple SSL product bypasses certificate validation, allowing Adversary-in-the-Middle (AITM) attack (Apple \"goto fail\" bug). CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).\n- **CVE-2021-22909:** Chain: router's firmware update procedure uses curl with \"-k\" (insecure) option that disables certificate validation (CWE-295), allowing adversary-in-the-middle (AITM) compromise with a malicious firmware image (CWE-494).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-342: Predictable Exact Value from Previous Values\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nAn exact value or random number can be precisely predicted by observing previous values.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-340\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, \"randomness\" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, \"entropy\" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-1463:** Firewall generates easily predictable initial sequence numbers (ISN), which allows remote attackers to spoof connections.\n- **CVE-1999-0074:** Listening TCP ports are sequentially allocated, allowing spoofing attacks.\n- **CVE-1999-0077:** Predictable TCP sequence numbers allow spoofing.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-350: Reliance on Reverse DNS Resolution for a Security-Critical Action\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product performs reverse DNS resolution on an IP address to obtain the hostname and make a security decision, but it does not properly ensure that the IP address is truly associated with the hostname.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nSince DNS names can be easily spoofed or misreported, and it may be difficult for the product to detect if a trusted DNS server has been compromised, DNS names do not constitute a valid authentication mechanism.\n\n\nWhen the product performs a reverse DNS resolution for an IP address, if an attacker controls the DNS server for that IP address, then the attacker can cause the server to return an arbitrary hostname. As a result, the attacker may be able to bypass authentication, cause the wrong hostname to be recorded in log files to hide activities, or perform other attacks.\n\n\nAttackers can spoof DNS names by either (1) compromising a DNS server and modifying its records (sometimes called DNS cache poisoning), or (2) having legitimate control over a DNS server associated with their IP address.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-290\nChildOf -> CWE-807\nCanPrecede -> CWE-923\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** CWE-350, CWE-247, and CWE-292 were merged into CWE-350 in CWE 2.5. CWE-247 was originally derived from Seven Pernicious Kingdoms, CWE-350 from PLOVER, and CWE-292 from CLASP. All taxonomies focused closely on the use of reverse DNS for authentication of incoming requests.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-1488:** Does not do double-reverse lookup to prevent DNS spoofing.\n- **CVE-2001-1500:** Does not verify reverse-resolved hostnames in DNS.\n- **CVE-2000-1221:** Authentication bypass using spoofed reverse-resolved DNS hostnames.\n\n",
