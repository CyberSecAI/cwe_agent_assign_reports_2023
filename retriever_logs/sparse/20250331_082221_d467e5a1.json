Direct access to the wp-cache-config.php file is not prohibited, so this vulnerability can be exploited for a web shell injection.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'input validation failure'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
