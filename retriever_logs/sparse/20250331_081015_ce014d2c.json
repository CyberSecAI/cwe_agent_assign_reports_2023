Fixed in 1.6.1 and 2.1.0.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'path traversal'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1. CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal (Score: 242.12)\n\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory....\n\n### 2. CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') (Score: 232.42)\n\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location th...\n\n### 3. CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') (Score: 226.24)\n\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource....\n\n### 4. CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal (Score: 197.44)\n\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as \"/abs/path\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory....\n\n### 5. CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path (Score: 196.83)\n\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations....\n\n## ROOTCAUSE: 'symlink processing'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1. CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal (Score: 242.12)\n\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory....\n\n### 2.

CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following (Score: 230.67)\n\nThe product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the file is a symbolic link that resolves to a target outside of the intended control sphere. This could allow an attacker to cause the product to operate on unauthorized files....\n\n### 4. CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') (Score: 226.24)\n\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource....\n\n### 5. CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition (Score: 193.17)\n\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state....\n\n## ROOTCAUSE: 'command injection'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
