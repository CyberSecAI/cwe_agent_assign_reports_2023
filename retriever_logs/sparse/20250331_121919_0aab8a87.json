This flaw allows an attacker to cause a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is availability.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **buffer leak**\n- **impact:** memory exhaustion\n- **vector:** incoming WebSocket PONG message\n- **attacker:** attacker\n- **product:** Undertow\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3690:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability is a buffer leak in the Undertow web server when handling incoming WebSocket PONG messages. If a WebSocket endpoint does not have a handler for `PongMessage` and sends PING messages, the server fails to properly release the buffer allocated for the incoming PONG response.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Buffer Leak:** The core weakness is the failure to deallocate a buffer after receiving a WebSocket PONG frame, leading to memory exhaustion.\n- **Missing Handler:** The vulnerability is triggered when a WebSocket endpoint doesn't register a message handler for `PongMessage`.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The buffer leak causes memory exhaustion, leading to `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Direct buffer memory` exceptions. This can cause the server to stop servicing any requests (including non-websocket connections), resulting in a denial of service.\n- **Resource Exhaustion:**  The leak affects the `java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=direct` mbean, causing the memory used by the direct buffer pool to grow continuously until it exhausts the available memory.\n- **Server Instability:** In the provided logs, the server throws  `XNIO001007` errors, and with leak detection enabled, \"Buffer leak detected\" errors are logged, indicating instability.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **WebSocket Connection:** The vulnerability is triggered by establishing a WebSocket connection to a vulnerable server.\n- **Sending PING Messages:** The server-side endpoint initiates the vulnerability by sending a PING message, which then receives a PONG response. If the server doesn't handle the PONG response correctly, a leak is triggered.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to establish a WebSocket connection to the target server to trigger the vulnerability.\n- **Ability to Initiate Connections:** The attacker must be able to send an initial request to the server so that the server will then send PING messages to the client.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- **Workaround:**  The issue can be mitigated by adding a `MessageHandler` for `PongMessage` in the `onOpen` method of the WebSocket endpoint, which handles the incoming PONG and prevents the leak by releasing the buffer.\n- **Affected Versions:**  The provided information indicates that the vulnerability was resolved in Undertow versions 2.2.10.Final, 2.0.40.Final, and 1.4.18.SP13.\n- **Patch:** A fix was implemented in the project and is available at  `<https://github.com/undertow-io/undertow/pull/1226>` and  `<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/undertow-io/undertow/-/merge_requests/112>`.\n- **Red Hat Products Affected:** The vulnerability affects various Red Hat products including Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, Red Hat support for Spring Boot, Red Hat Single Sign-On, Red Hat Integration, Red Hat Fuse, and RHINT Camel-K. These products have received updates to address this vulnerability.\n\nThe provided information offers more technical details about the root cause, steps to reproduce, workaround, and impact of the vulnerability than the basic CVE description placeholder.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 401 | Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.337 |\n| 2 | 789 | Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.302 |\n| 3 | 125 | Out-of-bounds Read | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.300 |\n| 4 | 119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.286 |\n| 5 | 674 | Uncontrolled Recursion | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.281 |\n| 6 | 124 | Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow') | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.606 |\n| 7 | 120 | Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') | Base | Allowed-with-Review | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 770 | Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.279 |\n| 9 | 787 | Out-of-bounds Write | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.273 |\n| 10 | 909 | Missing Initialization of Resource | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.273 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis is often triggered by improper handling of malformed data or unexpectedly interrupted sessions. In some languages, developers are responsible for tracking memory allocation and releasing the memory. If there are no more pointers or references to the memory, then it can no longer be tracked and identified for release.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nMemory Leak\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-772\nChildOf -> CWE-404\nChildOf -> CWE-404\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is often a resultant weakness due to improper handling of malformed data or early termination of sessions.\n\n**[Terminology]** \"memory leak\" has sometimes been used to describe other kinds of issues, e.g. for information leaks in which the contents of memory are inadvertently leaked (CVE-2003-0400 is one such example of this terminology conflict).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2005-3119:** Memory leak because function does not free() an element of a data structure.\n- **CVE-2004-0427:** Memory leak when counter variable is not decremented.\n- **CVE-2002-0574:** chain: reference count is not decremented, leading to memory leak in OS by sending ICMP packets.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nStack Exhaustion: When a weakness allocates excessive memory on the stack, it is often described as \"stack exhaustion,\" which is a technical impact of the weakness. This technical impact is often encountered as a consequence of CWE-789 and/or CWE-1325.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-770\nCanPrecede -> CWE-476\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness can be closely associated with integer overflows (CWE-190). Integer overflow attacks would concentrate on providing an extremely large number that triggers an overflow that causes less memory to be allocated than expected. By providing a large value that does not trigger an integer overflow, the attacker could still cause excessive amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**[Applicable Platform]** \n\nUncontrolled memory allocation is possible in many languages, such as dynamic array allocation in perl or initial size parameters in Collections in Java. However, languages like C and C++ where programmers have the power to more directly control memory management will be more susceptible.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2010-3701:** program uses ::alloca() for encoding messages, but large messages trigger segfault\n- **CVE-2008-1708:** memory consumption and daemon exit by specifying a large value in a length field\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOOB read: Shorthand for \"Out of bounds\" read\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-1018:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to read 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.\n- **CVE-2020-11899:** Out-of-bounds read in IP stack used in embedded systems, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: \"Heartbleed\" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nBuffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean \"write past the end of a buffer,\" whereas others use the same term to mean \"any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer.\" Others could mean \"any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write.\" Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.\nbuffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term \"buffer overrun,\" but most people use \"buffer overflow.\" See the alternate term for \"buffer overflow\" for context.\nmemory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the \"memory safety\" term.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-118\nChildOf -> CWE-20\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.\n**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Applicable Platform]** \n\nIt is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nStack Exhaustion\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-834\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2007-1285:** Deeply nested arrays trigger stack exhaustion.\n- **CVE-2007-3409:** Self-referencing pointers create infinite loop and resultant stack exhaustion.\n- **CVE-2016-10707:** Javascript application accidentally changes input in a way that prevents a recursive call from detecting an exit condition.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis typically occurs when a pointer or its index is decremented to a position before the buffer, when pointer arithmetic results in a position before the beginning of the valid memory location, or when a negative index is used.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nbuffer underrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term \"buffer underrun\". \"Buffer underflow\" is more commonly used, although both terms are also sometimes used to describe a buffer under-read (CWE-127).\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-786\nChildOf -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This could be resultant from several errors, including a bad offset or an array index that decrements before the beginning of the buffer (see CWE-129).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-24018:** buffer underwrite in firmware verification routine allows code execution via a crafted firmware image\n- **CVE-2002-2227:** Unchecked length of SSLv2 challenge value leads to buffer underflow.\n- **CVE-2007-4580:** Buffer underflow from a small size value with a large buffer (length parameter inconsistency, CWE-130)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.\n\n### Extended Description\nA buffer overflow condition exists when a product attempts to put more data in a buffer than it can hold, or when it attempts to put data in a memory area outside of the boundaries of a buffer. The simplest type of error, and the most common cause of buffer overflows, is the \"classic\" case in which the product copies the buffer without restricting how much is copied. Other variants exist, but the existence of a classic overflow strongly suggests that the programmer is not considering even the most basic of security protections.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nClassic Buffer Overflow: This term was frequently used by vulnerability researchers during approximately 1995 to 2005 to differentiate buffer copies without length checks (which had been known about for decades) from other emerging weaknesses that still involved invalid accesses of buffers, as vulnerability researchers began to develop advanced exploitation techniques.\nUnbounded Transfer\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-123\nChildOf -> CWE-20\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** There are some indications that this CWE ID might be misused and selected simply because it mentions \"buffer overflow\" - an increasingly vague term. This CWE entry is only appropriate for \"Buffer Copy\" operations (not buffer reads), in which where there is no \"Checking [the] Size of Input\", and (by implication of the copy) writing past the end of the buffer.\n**Comments:** If the vulnerability being analyzed involves out-of-bounds reads, then consider CWE-125 or descendants. For root cause analysis: if there is any input validation, consider children of CWE-20 such as CWE-1284. If there is a calculation error for buffer sizes, consider CWE-131 or similar.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** At the code level, stack-based and heap-based overflows do not differ significantly, so there usually is not a need to distinguish them. From the attacker perspective, they can be quite different, since different techniques are required to exploit them.\n\n**[Terminology]** Many issues that are now called \"buffer overflows\" are substantively different than the \"classic\" overflow, including entirely different bug types that rely on overflow exploit techniques, such as integer signedness errors, integer overflows, and format string bugs. This imprecise terminology can make it difficult to determine which variant is being reported.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2000-1094:** buffer overflow using command with long argument\n- **CVE-1999-0046:** buffer overflow in local program using long environment variable\n- **CVE-2002-1337:** buffer overflow in comment characters, when product increments a counter for a \">\" but does not decrement for \"<\"\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nCode frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-400\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nChildOf -> CWE-400\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).\n\n**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. \"Resource exhaustion\" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..\n- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nMemory Corruption: Often used to describe the consequences of writing to memory outside the bounds of a buffer, or to memory that is otherwise invalid.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

If a resource is not initialized, it could contain unpredictable or expired data, or it could be initialized to defaults that are invalid. This can have security implications when the resource is expected to have certain properties or values.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nCanPrecede -> CWE-908\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-20739:** A variable that has its value set in a conditional statement is sometimes used when the conditional fails, sometimes causing data leakage\n- **CVE-2005-1036:** Chain: Bypass of access restrictions due to improper authorization (CWE-862) of a user results from an improperly initialized (CWE-909) I/O permission bitmap\n\n",
