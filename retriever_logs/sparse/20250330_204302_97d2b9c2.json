Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-1017:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to write 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.\n- **CVE-2021-21220:** Chain: insufficient input validation (CWE-20) in browser allows heap corruption (CWE-787), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-28664:** GPU kernel driver allows memory corruption because a user can obtain read/write access to read-only pages, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.\n\n### Extended Description\nA buffer overflow condition exists when a product attempts to put more data in a buffer than it can hold, or when it attempts to put data in a memory area outside of the boundaries of a buffer. The simplest type of error, and the most common cause of buffer overflows, is the \"classic\" case in which the product copies the buffer without restricting how much is copied. Other variants exist, but the existence of a classic overflow strongly suggests that the programmer is not considering even the most basic of security protections.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nClassic Buffer Overflow: This term was frequently used by vulnerability researchers during approximately 1995 to 2005 to differentiate buffer copies without length checks (which had been known about for decades) from other emerging weaknesses that still involved invalid accesses of buffers, as vulnerability researchers began to develop advanced exploitation techniques.\nUnbounded Transfer\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-123\nChildOf -> CWE-20\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** There are some indications that this CWE ID might be misused and selected simply because it mentions \"buffer overflow\" - an increasingly vague term. This CWE entry is only appropriate for \"Buffer Copy\" operations (not buffer reads), in which where there is no \"Checking [the] Size of Input\", and (by implication of the copy) writing past the end of the buffer.\n**Comments:** If the vulnerability being analyzed involves out-of-bounds reads, then consider CWE-125 or descendants. For root cause analysis: if there is any input validation, consider children of CWE-20 such as CWE-1284. If there is a calculation error for buffer sizes, consider CWE-131 or similar.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** At the code level, stack-based and heap-based overflows do not differ significantly, so there usually is not a need to distinguish them. From the attacker perspective, they can be quite different, since different techniques are required to exploit them.\n\n**[Terminology]** Many issues that are now called \"buffer overflows\" are substantively different than the \"classic\" overflow, including entirely different bug types that rely on overflow exploit techniques, such as integer signedness errors, integer overflows, and format string bugs. This imprecise terminology can make it difficult to determine which variant is being reported.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2000-1094:** buffer overflow using command with long argument\n- **CVE-1999-0046:** buffer overflow in local program using long environment variable\n- **CVE-2002-1337:** buffer overflow in comment characters, when product increments a counter for a \">\" but does not decrement for \"<\"\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may\n         become a very small or negative number.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOverflow: The terms \"overflow\" and \"wraparound\" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.\nWraparound: The terms \"overflow\" and \"wraparound\" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.\nwrap, wrap-around, wrap around: Alternate spellings of \"wraparound\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with \"overflow,\" \"underflow,\" and \"wraparound\" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called \"underflows\").\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\n\"Integer overflow\" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.\n\n\nA \"wraparound\" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.\n\n\n\"Overflow\" is sometimes conflated with \"wraparound\" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.\n\n\nThe \"overflow\" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use \"overflow\" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using \"underflow\" for exceeding the minimum.\n\n\nSome people use \"overflow\" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses \"underflow\" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.\n\n\nSee [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.\n\n\n**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis typically occurs when a pointer or its index is decremented to a position before the buffer, when pointer arithmetic results in a position before the beginning of the valid memory location, or when a negative index is used.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nbuffer underrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term \"buffer underrun\". \"Buffer underflow\" is more commonly used, although both terms are also sometimes used to describe a buffer under-read (CWE-127).\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-786\nChildOf -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This could be resultant from several errors, including a bad offset or an array index that decrements before the beginning of the buffer (see CWE-129).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-24018:** buffer underwrite in firmware verification routine allows code execution via a crafted firmware image\n- **CVE-2002-2227:** Unchecked length of SSLv2 challenge value leads to buffer underflow.\n- **CVE-2007-4580:** Buffer underflow from a small size value with a large buffer (length parameter inconsistency, CWE-130)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** \n\nThis is a broad category. Some examples include:\n\n\n  - simple math errors,\n\n  - incorrectly updating parallel counters,\n\n  - not accounting for size differences when \"transforming\" one input to another format (e.g. URL canonicalization or other transformation that can generate a result that's larger than the original input, i.e. \"expansion\").\n\nThis level of detail is rarely available in public reports, so it is difficult to find good examples.\n\n**[Maintenance]** \n\nThis weakness may be a composite or a chain. It also may contain layering or perspective differences.\n\n\nThis issue may be associated with many different types of incorrect calculations (CWE-682), although the integer overflow (CWE-190) is probably the most prevalent. This can be primary to resource consumption problems (CWE-400), including uncontrolled memory allocation (CWE-789). However, its relationship with out-of-bounds buffer access (CWE-119) must also be considered.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-17087:** Chain: integer truncation (CWE-197) causes small buffer allocation (CWE-131) leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) in kernel pool, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2004-1363:** substitution overflow: buffer overflow using environment variables that are expanded after the length check is performed\n- **CVE-2004-0747:** substitution overflow: buffer overflow using expansion of environment variables\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen the length value exceeds the size of the destination, a buffer overflow could occur.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2011-1959:** Chain: large length value causes buffer over-read (CWE-126)\n- **CVE-2011-1848:** Use of packet length field to make a calculation, then copy into a fixed-size buffer\n- **CVE-2011-0105:** Chain: retrieval of length value from an uninitialized memory location\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nAny condition where the attacker has the ability to write an arbitrary value to an arbitrary location, often as the result of a buffer overflow.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-787\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Functions in this category were often implemented without taking security concerns into account. The gets() function is unsafe because it does not perform bounds checking on the size of its input. An attacker can easily send arbitrarily-sized input to gets() and overflow the destination buffer. Similarly, the >> operator is unsafe to use when reading into a statically-allocated character array because it does not perform bounds checking on the size of its input. An attacker can easily send arbitrarily-sized input to the >> operator and overflow the destination buffer.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1177\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Heap-based buffer overflows are usually just as dangerous as stack-based buffer overflows.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2007-4268:** Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nStack Overflow: \"Stack Overflow\" is often used to mean the same thing as stack-based buffer overflow, however it is also used on occasion to mean stack exhaustion, usually a result from an excessively recursive function call. Due to the ambiguity of the term, use of stack overflow to describe either circumstance is discouraged.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-788\nChildOf -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** Stack-based buffer overflows can instantiate in return address overwrites, stack pointer overwrites or frame pointer overwrites. They can also be considered function pointer overwrites, array indexer overwrites or write-what-where condition, etc.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-35395:** Stack-based buffer overflows in SFK for wifi chipset used for IoT/embedded devices, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n",
