During shape inference, TensorFlow can allocate a large vector based on a value from a tensor controlled by the user. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **impact:** allocate large vector based on user-controlled tensor\n- **product:** TensorFlow\n- **version:** 2.8.0, 2.7.1, 2.6.3, 2.5.3\n- **component:** shape inference\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23580:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the `InternalMakeShapeFromTensor` function within TensorFlow's shape inference mechanism. Specifically, the code uses a user-controlled value from a tensor to determine the size of a vector allocation.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Unbounded Vector Allocation:** The code reserves space for a `std::vector<DimensionHandle>` called `dims` using a size derived directly from the tensor provided by the user without proper validation,\n- **Integer Overflow:** Although not explicitly stated, the possibility of an integer overflow before the vector allocation can not be ruled out, as the value from the user-provided tensor is a `int64_t` and is used to allocate the vector without bounds checking of its size.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing a very large value in the tensor, an attacker can trigger the allocation of an extremely large vector. This excessive allocation can lead to a denial of service by causing the process to crash or consume excessive memory.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Manipulated Input Tensor:** An attacker can craft a malicious input tensor with a large integer value representing the number of dimensions, which will then be used to allocate the vector.\n- **TensorFlow Graph Construction:** The vulnerability can be triggered during the construction of a TensorFlow graph where shape inference is performed.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Control over Input Tensor:** The attacker must have the ability to provide or influence the input tensor that is used in the `MakeShapeFromShapeTensor` or `MakeShapeFromShapeTensorTreatScalarAsUnknownShape` functions which calls `InternalMakeShapeFromTensor`\n- **Knowledge of TensorFlow Graph Structure:** While not strictly necessary, knowledge of the TensorFlow graph structure where shape inference is performed would help an attacker target the vulnerable code path.\n\n**Additional details:**\n- The vulnerability is located in `tensorflow/core/framework/shape_inference.cc`, specifically lines 788-790.\n- The fix implemented in commit `1361fb7e29449629e1df94d44e0427ebec8c83c7` adds a check to ensure that the number of dimensions does not exceed `1 << 20`. This prevents the allocation of excessively large vectors.\n- The vulnerability affects TensorFlow versions prior to 2.8.0, but is also patched in versions 2.5.3, 2.6.3 and 2.7.1.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 824 | Access of Uninitialized Pointer | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.219 |\n| 2 | 1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.197 |\n| 3 | 681 | Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.194 |\n| 4 | 617 | Reachable Assertion | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.193 |\n| 5 | 122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.175 |\n| 6 | 1287 | Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.334 |\n| 7 | 787 | Out-of-bounds Write | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 663 | Use of a Non-reentrant Function in a Concurrent Context | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.173 |\n| 9 | 674 | Uncontrolled Recursion | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.172 |\n| 10 | 95 | Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection') | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.166 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nIf the pointer contains an uninitialized value, then the value might not point to a valid memory location. This could cause the product to read from or write to unexpected memory locations, leading to a denial of service. If the uninitialized pointer is used as a function call, then arbitrary functions could be invoked. If an attacker can influence the portion of uninitialized memory that is contained in the pointer, this weakness could be leveraged to execute code or perform other attacks.\n\n\nDepending on memory layout, associated memory management behaviors, and product operation, the attacker might be able to influence the contents of the uninitialized pointer, thus gaining more fine-grained control of the memory location to be accessed.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-125\nCanPrecede -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-789\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
