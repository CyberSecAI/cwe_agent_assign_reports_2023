If the token cannot match, the engine \"backtracks\" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.\n Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:\n\n\n  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.\n\n  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.\n\n  - The input can be long enough.\n\n Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. \n\n### Alternative Terms\nReDoS: ReDoS is an abbreviation of \"Regular expression Denial of Service\".\nRegular Expression Denial of Service: While this term is attack-focused, this is commonly used to describe the weakness.\nCatastrophic backtracking: This term is used to describe the behavior of the regular expression as a negative technical impact.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-407\nChildOf -> CWE-407\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-5243:** server allows ReDOS with crafted User-Agent strings, due to overlapping capture groups that cause excessive backtracking.\n- **CVE-2021-21317:** npm package for user-agent parser prone to ReDoS due to overlapping capture groups\n- **CVE-2019-16215:** Markdown parser uses inefficient regex when processing a message, allowing users to cause CPU consumption and delay preventing processing of other messages.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-186: Overly Restrictive Regular Expression\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA regular expression is overly restrictive, which prevents dangerous values from being detected.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis weakness is not about regular expression complexity. Rather, it is about a regular expression that does not match all values that are intended. Consider the use of a regexp to identify acceptable values or to spot unwanted terms. An overly restrictive regexp misses some potentially security-relevant values leading to either false positives *or* false negatives, depending on how the regexp is being used within the code. Consider the expression /[0-8]/ where the intention was /[0-9]/. This expression is not \"complex\" but the value \"9\" is not matched when maybe the programmer planned to check for it.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-185\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-184\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-183\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Can overlap allowlist/denylist errors (CWE-183/CWE-184)\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2005-1604:** MIE. \".php.ns\" bypasses \".php$\" regexp but is still parsed as PHP by Apache. (manipulates an equivalence property under Apache)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nQuadratic Complexity: Used when the algorithmic complexity is related to the square of the number of inputs (N^2)\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-405\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-32617:** C++ library for image metadata has \"quadratic complexity\" issue with unnecessarily repetitive parsing each time an invalid character is encountered\n- **CVE-2020-10735:** Python has \"quadratic complexity\" issue when converting string to int with many digits in unexpected bases\n- **CVE-2020-5243:** server allows ReDOS with crafted User-Agent strings, due to overlapping capture groups that cause excessive backtracking.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-777: Regular Expression without Anchors\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a regular expression to perform neutralization, but the regular expression is not anchored and may allow malicious or malformed data to slip through.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen performing tasks such as validating against a set of allowed inputs (allowlist), data is examined and possibly modified to ensure that it is well-formed and adheres to a list of safe values. If the regular expression is not anchored, malicious or malformed data may be included before or after any string matching the regular expression. The type of malicious data that is allowed will depend on the context of the application and which anchors are omitted from the regular expression.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-625\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-625: Permissive Regular Expression\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a regular expression that does not sufficiently restrict the set of allowed values.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis effectively causes the regexp to accept substrings that match the pattern, which produces a partial comparison to the target. In some cases, this can lead to other weaknesses. Common errors include:\n\n\n  - not identifying the beginning and end of the target string\n\n  - using wildcards instead of acceptable character ranges\n\n  - others\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-185\nPeerOf -> CWE-187\nPeerOf -> CWE-184\nPeerOf -> CWE-183\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-22204:** Chain: regex in EXIF processor code does not correctly determine where a string ends (CWE-625), enabling eval injection (CWE-95), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2006-1895:** \".*\" regexp leads to static code injection\n- **CVE-2002-2175:** insertion of username into regexp results in partial comparison, causing wrong database entry to be updated when one username is a substring of another.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-185: Incorrect Regular Expression\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product specifies a regular expression in a way that causes data to be improperly matched or compared.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen the regular expression is used in protection mechanisms such as filtering or validation, this may allow an attacker to bypass the intended restrictions on the incoming data.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-697\nCanPrecede -> CWE-187\nCanPrecede -> CWE-182\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** While there is some overlap with allowlist/denylist problems, this entry is intended to deal with incorrectly written regular expressions, regardless of their intended use. Not every regular expression is intended for use as an allowlist or denylist. In addition, allowlists and denylists can be implemented using other mechanisms besides regular expressions.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Regexp errors are likely a primary factor in many MFVs, especially those that require multiple manipulations to exploit. However, they are rarely diagnosed at this level of detail.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-2109:** Regexp isn't \"anchored\" to the beginning or end, which allows spoofed values that have trusted values as substrings.\n- **CVE-2005-1949:** Regexp for IP address isn't anchored at the end, allowing appending of shell metacharacters.\n- **CVE-2001-1072:** Bypass access restrictions via multiple leading slash, which causes a regular expression to fail.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-187: Partial String Comparison\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs a comparison that only examines a portion of a factor before determining whether there is a match, such as a substring, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n### Extended Description\nFor example, an attacker might succeed in authentication by providing a small password that matches the associated portion of the larger, correct password.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1023\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is conceptually similar to other weaknesses, such as insufficient verification and regular expression errors. It is primary to some weaknesses.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2014-6394:** Product does not prevent access to restricted directories due to partial string comparison with a public directory\n- **CVE-2004-1012:** Argument parser of an IMAP server treats a partial command \"body[p\" as if it is \"body.peek\", leading to index error and out-of-bounds corruption.\n- **CVE-2004-0765:** Web browser only checks the hostname portion of a certificate when the hostname portion of the URI is not a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), which allows remote attackers to spoof trusted certificates.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-624: Executable Regular Expression Error\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a regular expression that either (1) contains an executable component with user-controlled inputs, or (2) allows a user to enable execution by inserting pattern modifiers.\n\n### Extended Description\nCase (2) is possible in the PHP preg_replace() function, and possibly in other languages when a user-controlled input is inserted into a string that is later parsed as a regular expression.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-77\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Research Gap]** Under-studied. The existing PHP reports are limited to highly skilled researchers, but there are few examples for other languages. It is suspected that this is under-reported for all languages. Usability factors might make it more prevalent in PHP, but this theory has not been investigated.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2006-2059:** Executable regexp in PHP by inserting \"e\" modifier into first argument to preg_replace\n- **CVE-2005-3420:** Executable regexp in PHP by inserting \"e\" modifier into first argument to preg_replace\n- **CVE-2006-2878:** Complex curly syntax inserted into the replacement argument to PHP preg_replace(), which uses the \"/e\" modifier\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-637: Unnecessary Complexity in Protection Mechanism (Not Using 'Economy of Mechanism')\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a more complex mechanism than necessary, which could lead to resultant weaknesses when the mechanism is not correctly understood, modeled, configured, implemented, or used.\n\n### Extended Description\nSecurity mechanisms should be as simple as possible. Complex security mechanisms may engender partial implementations and compatibility problems, with resulting mismatches in assumptions and implemented security. A corollary of this principle is that data specifications should be as simple as possible, because complex data specifications result in complex validation code. Complex tasks and systems may also need to be guarded by complex security checks, so simple systems should be preferred.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nUnnecessary Complexity\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-657\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2007-6067:** Support for complex regular expressions leads to a resultant algorithmic complexity weakness (CWE-407).\n- **CVE-2007-1552:** Either a filename extension and a Content-Type header could be used to infer the file type, but the developer only checks the Content-Type, enabling unrestricted file upload (CWE-434).\n- **CVE-2007-6479:** In Apache environments, a \"filename.php.gif\" can be redirected to the PHP interpreter instead of being sent as an image/gif directly to the user. Not knowing this, the developer only checks the last extension of a submitted filename, enabling arbitrary code execution.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1176: Inefficient CPU Computation\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs CPU computations using\n         algorithms that are not as efficient as they could be for the\n         needs of the developer, i.e., the computations can be\n         optimized further.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis issue can make the product perform more slowly, possibly in ways that are noticeable to the users. If an attacker can influence the amount of computation that must be performed, e.g. by triggering worst-case complexity, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-405\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-37734:** Chain: lexer in Java-based GraphQL server does not enforce maximum of tokens early enough (CWE-696), allowing excessive CPU consumption (CWE-1176)\n\n",

If the token cannot match, the engine \"backtracks\" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.\n Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:\n\n\n  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.\n\n  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.\n\n  - The input can be long enough.\n\n Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. \n\n### Alternative Terms\nReDoS: ReDoS is an abbreviation of \"Regular expression Denial of Service\".\nRegular Expression Denial of Service: While this term is attack-focused, this is commonly used to describe the weakness.\nCatastrophic backtracking: This term is used to describe the behavior of the regular expression as a negative technical impact.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-407\nChildOf -> CWE-407\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-5243:** server allows ReDOS with crafted User-Agent strings, due to overlapping capture groups that cause excessive backtracking.\n- **CVE-2021-21317:** npm package for user-agent parser prone to ReDoS due to overlapping capture groups\n- **CVE-2019-16215:** Markdown parser uses inefficient regex when processing a message, allowing users to cause CPU consumption and delay preventing processing of other messages.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-186: Overly Restrictive Regular Expression\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA regular expression is overly restrictive, which prevents dangerous values from being detected.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis weakness is not about regular expression complexity. Rather, it is about a regular expression that does not match all values that are intended. Consider the use of a regexp to identify acceptable values or to spot unwanted terms. An overly restrictive regexp misses some potentially security-relevant values leading to either false positives *or* false negatives, depending on how the regexp is being used within the code. Consider the expression /[0-8]/ where the intention was /[0-9]/. This expression is not \"complex\" but the value \"9\" is not matched when maybe the programmer planned to check for it.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-185\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-184\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-183\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Can overlap allowlist/denylist errors (CWE-183/CWE-184)\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2005-1604:** MIE. \".php.ns\" bypasses \".php$\" regexp but is still parsed as PHP by Apache. (manipulates an equivalence property under Apache)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nQuadratic Complexity: Used when the algorithmic complexity is related to the square of the number of inputs (N^2)\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-405\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-32617:** C++ library for image metadata has \"quadratic complexity\" issue with unnecessarily repetitive parsing each time an invalid character is encountered\n- **CVE-2020-10735:** Python has \"quadratic complexity\" issue when converting string to int with many digits in unexpected bases\n- **CVE-2020-5243:** server allows ReDOS with crafted User-Agent strings, due to overlapping capture groups that cause excessive backtracking.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-777: Regular Expression without Anchors\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a regular expression to perform neutralization, but the regular expression is not anchored and may allow malicious or malformed data to slip through.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen performing tasks such as validating against a set of allowed inputs (allowlist), data is examined and possibly modified to ensure that it is well-formed and adheres to a list of safe values. If the regular expression is not anchored, malicious or malformed data may be included before or after any string matching the regular expression. The type of malicious data that is allowed will depend on the context of the application and which anchors are omitted from the regular expression.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-625\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-625: Permissive Regular Expression\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a regular expression that does not sufficiently restrict the set of allowed values.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis effectively causes the regexp to accept substrings that match the pattern, which produces a partial comparison to the target. In some cases, this can lead to other weaknesses. Common errors include:\n\n\n  - not identifying the beginning and end of the target string\n\n  - using wildcards instead of acceptable character ranges\n\n  - others\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-185\nPeerOf -> CWE-187\nPeerOf -> CWE-184\nPeerOf -> CWE-183\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-22204:** Chain: regex in EXIF processor code does not correctly determine where a string ends (CWE-625), enabling eval injection (CWE-95), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2006-1895:** \".*\" regexp leads to static code injection\n- **CVE-2002-2175:** insertion of username into regexp results in partial comparison, causing wrong database entry to be updated when one username is a substring of another.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-185: Incorrect Regular Expression\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product specifies a regular expression in a way that causes data to be improperly matched or compared.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen the regular expression is used in protection mechanisms such as filtering or validation, this may allow an attacker to bypass the intended restrictions on the incoming data.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-697\nCanPrecede -> CWE-187\nCanPrecede -> CWE-182\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** While there is some overlap with allowlist/denylist problems, this entry is intended to deal with incorrectly written regular expressions, regardless of their intended use. Not every regular expression is intended for use as an allowlist or denylist. In addition, allowlists and denylists can be implemented using other mechanisms besides regular expressions.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Regexp errors are likely a primary factor in many MFVs, especially those that require multiple manipulations to exploit. However, they are rarely diagnosed at this level of detail.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-2109:** Regexp isn't \"anchored\" to the beginning or end, which allows spoofed values that have trusted values as substrings.\n- **CVE-2005-1949:** Regexp for IP address isn't anchored at the end, allowing appending of shell metacharacters.\n- **CVE-2001-1072:** Bypass access restrictions via multiple leading slash, which causes a regular expression to fail.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-187: Partial String Comparison\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs a comparison that only examines a portion of a factor before determining whether there is a match, such as a substring, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n### Extended Description\nFor example, an attacker might succeed in authentication by providing a small password that matches the associated portion of the larger, correct password.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1023\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is conceptually similar to other weaknesses, such as insufficient verification and regular expression errors. It is primary to some weaknesses.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2014-6394:** Product does not prevent access to restricted directories due to partial string comparison with a public directory\n- **CVE-2004-1012:** Argument parser of an IMAP server treats a partial command \"body[p\" as if it is \"body.peek\", leading to index error and out-of-bounds corruption.\n- **CVE-2004-0765:** Web browser only checks the hostname portion of a certificate when the hostname portion of the URI is not a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), which allows remote attackers to spoof trusted certificates.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-624: Executable Regular Expression Error\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a regular expression that either (1) contains an executable component with user-controlled inputs, or (2) allows a user to enable execution by inserting pattern modifiers.\n\n### Extended Description\nCase (2) is possible in the PHP preg_replace() function, and possibly in other languages when a user-controlled input is inserted into a string that is later parsed as a regular expression.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-77\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Research Gap]** Under-studied. The existing PHP reports are limited to highly skilled researchers, but there are few examples for other languages. It is suspected that this is under-reported for all languages. Usability factors might make it more prevalent in PHP, but this theory has not been investigated.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2006-2059:** Executable regexp in PHP by inserting \"e\" modifier into first argument to preg_replace\n- **CVE-2005-3420:** Executable regexp in PHP by inserting \"e\" modifier into first argument to preg_replace\n- **CVE-2006-2878:** Complex curly syntax inserted into the replacement argument to PHP preg_replace(), which uses the \"/e\" modifier\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-637: Unnecessary Complexity in Protection Mechanism (Not Using 'Economy of Mechanism')\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a more complex mechanism than necessary, which could lead to resultant weaknesses when the mechanism is not correctly understood, modeled, configured, implemented, or used.\n\n### Extended Description\nSecurity mechanisms should be as simple as possible. Complex security mechanisms may engender partial implementations and compatibility problems, with resulting mismatches in assumptions and implemented security. A corollary of this principle is that data specifications should be as simple as possible, because complex data specifications result in complex validation code. Complex tasks and systems may also need to be guarded by complex security checks, so simple systems should be preferred.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nUnnecessary Complexity\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-657\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2007-6067:** Support for complex regular expressions leads to a resultant algorithmic complexity weakness (CWE-407).\n- **CVE-2007-1552:** Either a filename extension and a Content-Type header could be used to infer the file type, but the developer only checks the Content-Type, enabling unrestricted file upload (CWE-434).\n- **CVE-2007-6479:** In Apache environments, a \"filename.php.gif\" can be redirected to the PHP interpreter instead of being sent as an image/gif directly to the user. Not knowing this, the developer only checks the last extension of a submitted filename, enabling arbitrary code execution.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1176: Inefficient CPU Computation\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs CPU computations using\n         algorithms that are not as efficient as they could be for the\n         needs of the developer, i.e., the computations can be\n         optimized further.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis issue can make the product perform more slowly, possibly in ways that are noticeable to the users. If an attacker can influence the amount of computation that must be performed, e.g. by triggering worst-case complexity, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-405\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-37734:** Chain: lexer in Java-based GraphQL server does not enforce maximum of tokens early enough (CWE-696), allowing excessive CPU consumption (CWE-1176)\n\n"
