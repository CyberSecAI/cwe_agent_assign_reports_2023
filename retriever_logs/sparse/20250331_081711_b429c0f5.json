Specifically, the application is passing untrusted, potentially attacker-controlled input directly to the `send_file` function, which leads to an **absolute path traversal** vulnerability.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Absolute Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The primary weakness is that the application allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path on the server's filesystem. This is possible because the `send_file` function, when provided with a path, will serve the file at that location, without any validation or sanitization.\n*   **Unsafe use of `os.path.join`:** In some cases, the code uses the `os.path.join` function in an unsafe manner. This function, when used with untrusted input can allow absolute path traversal since it does not validate input paths correctly, ignoring the intended base path when an absolute path is provided in the untrusted input.\n*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The applications are not properly sanitizing or validating the input path parameters before passing them to `send_file`.\n*   **Direct Exposure of File System:** The vulnerability allows attackers to potentially access any file on the server that the application has permissions to read.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Confidentiality Breach:** The most significant impact is a high confidentiality risk. An attacker can potentially read sensitive files, such as configuration files, source code, or other private data, from the server.\n*   **Potential for Limited Availability Impact:** While the primary risk is confidentiality, an attacker could also potentially cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by repeatedly requesting large files. However, this is typically considered a low availability risk.\n*   **Integrity Remains Unaffected:** The vulnerability does not inherently allow an attacker to modify files on the server. Therefore the integrity of the system remains unaffected.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network-based Exploitation:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning a remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability. The attacker sends a malicious HTTP request containing the arbitrary path.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without requiring any user authentication. An attacker can be completely unprivileged.\n*   **Knowledge of the API:** An attacker needs knowledge of the API endpoint that uses the `send_file` function and its path parameter, as well as an understanding of how path traversal vulnerabilities work.\n*   **No User Interaction Required:** The attack is possible without requiring any user interaction. The attacker crafts a specific URL request, and the server serves the file if the path exists.\n\n**Specific CVE information**\n\nAcross the different CVE's, there are slightly different severities that mostly seem to reflect the use-case/context where the vulnerable code exists. However, fundamentally they all suffer from the same issue. As you can see below the impact metrics are quite similar:\n\n**CVE-2022-31587 (yuriyouzhou/KG-fashion-chatbot):**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31513 (BolunHan/Krypton):**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31516 (Harveyzyh/Python):**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31567 (DSABenchmark/DSAB):**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31511 (AFDudley/equanimity):**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31561 (varijkapil13/Sphere_ImageBackend):**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31577 (longmaoteamtf/audio\\_aligner\\_app):**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31583 (sravaniboinepelli/AutomatedQuizEval):**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31504 (ChangeWeDer/BaiduWenkuSpider_flaskWeb):**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31545 (ml-inory/ModelConverter):**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31535 (freefood89/Fishtank):**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31516 (Harveyzyh/Python):**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31510 (sergeKashkin/Simple-RAT):**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31574 (deepaliupadhyay/RealEstate):**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31559 (tsileo/flask-yeoman):**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31571 (akashtalole/python-flask-restful-api):**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31520 (Luxas98/logstash-management-api):**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31557 (seveas/golem):**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31532 (dankolbman/travel\\_blahg):**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31547 (noamezekiel/sphere):**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31552 (project-anuvaad/anuvaad-corpus):**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31548 (nrlakin/homepage):**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31564 (woduq1414/munhak-moa):**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31533 (decentraminds/umbral):**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31576 (heidi-luong1109/shackerpanel):**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31585 (umeshpatil-dev/Home\\_\\_internet):**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31527 (Wildog/flask-file-server):**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31515 (Delor4/CarceresBE):**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31566 (DSAB-local/DSAB):**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N\n\n**CVE-2022-31569**: (This CVE was rejected due to invalid CPE data, however, the root cause is the same as all the other CVEs)\n  The rejected CVE pointed to\n  <https://github.com/RipudamanKaushikDal/projects> which contained the vulnerable code for a sub-project named *image\\_search\\_gallery*\n\n  The description was \"The  os.path.join function used in image_search_gallery of repository RipudamanKaushikDal/projects allows absolute path traversal because the Flask send\\_file function is used unsafely.\"\n\n**CVE-2022-31505**\n  The CVE pointed to:\n  <https://github.com/cheo0/MercadoEnLineaBack>\n\n  The description was \"The cheo0/MercadoEnLineaBack repository on GitHub allows absolute path traversal because the Flask send\\_file function is used unsafely.\"\n\n**CVE-2022-31538 (joaopedro-fg/mp-m08-interface)**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31544 (meerstein/rbtm)**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31579 (ralphjzhang/iasset)**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**CVE-2022-31562 (waveyan/internshipsystem)**\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Avoid using `send_file` directly with untrusted paths:** Use `flask.safe_join` or  `flask.send_from_directory`.\n*   **Sanitize Input Paths:** Implement robust input sanitization and validation to ensure that no path traversal characters or absolute paths are passed to the `send_file` function.\n*   **Properly configure `send_file`:** If not already, limit file access to specific, valid directories.\n\nIn summary, the vulnerability stems from the direct use of user-controlled input with `flask.send_file`, enabling attackers to perform absolute path traversal and access sensitive files. The key to preventing this vulnerability lies in adopting input sanitization and using Flask's safer alternatives like `send_from_directory` or `safe_join`.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | Base | Allowed | alternate_terms | 0.800 |\n| 2 | 36 | Absolute Path Traversal | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.338 |\n| 3 | 73 | External Control of File Name or Path | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.197 |\n| 4 | 23 | Relative Path Traversal | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.146 |\n| 5 | 37 | Path Traversal: '/absolute/pathname/here' | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.124 |\n| 6 | 24 | Path Traversal: '../filedir' | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.531 |\n| 7 | 59 | Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 38 | Path Traversal: '\\absolute\\pathname\\here' | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.111 |\n| 9 | 182 | Collapse of Data into Unsafe Value | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.101 |\n| 10 | 39 | Path Traversal: 'C:dirname' | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.100 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDirectory traversal\nPath traversal: \"Path traversal\" is preferred over \"directory traversal,\" but both terms are attack-focused.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add \".txt\" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.\n\n**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.\n\n**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing \"/\" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nLike other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use \"directory traversal\" only to refer to the injection of \"..\" and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.\n\n\nOther variants like \"absolute pathname\" and \"drive letter\" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve \"..\" or equivalent.\n\n\n**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.\n\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nIncomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that \"..\\\" is vulnerable, but not test \"../\" which may also be vulnerable.\n\n\nAny combination of directory separators (\"/\", \"\\\", etc.) and numbers of \".\" (e.g. \"....\") can produce unique variants; for example, the \"//../\" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a.

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-31503:** Python package constructs filenames using an unsafe os.path.join call on untrusted input, allowing absolute path traversal because os.path.join resets the pathname to an absolute path that is specified as part of the input.\n- **CVE-2002-1345:** Multiple FTP clients write arbitrary files via absolute paths in server responses\n- **CVE-2001-1269:** ZIP file extractor allows full path\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis could allow an attacker to access or modify system files or other files that are critical to the application.\n\n\nPath manipulation errors occur when the following two conditions are met:\n\n```\n\t\t1. An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.\n\t\t2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.\n```\nFor example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-642\nChildOf -> CWE-610\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-22\nCanPrecede -> CWE-41\nCanPrecede -> CWE-98\nCanPrecede -> CWE-434\nCanPrecede -> CWE-59\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This suggests some abstraction problems that should be resolved in future versions.\n\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThe external control of filenames can be the primary link in chains with other file-related weaknesses, as seen in the CanPrecede relationships. This is because software systems use files for many different purposes: to execute programs, load code libraries, to store application data, to store configuration settings, record temporary data, act as signals or semaphores to other processes, etc.\n\n\nHowever, those weaknesses do not always require external control. For example, link-following weaknesses (CWE-59) often involve pathnames that are not controllable by the attacker at all.\n\n\nThe external control can be resultant from other issues. For example, in PHP applications, the register_globals setting can allow an attacker to modify variables that the programmer thought were immutable, enabling file inclusion (CWE-98) and path traversal (CWE-22). Operating with excessive privileges (CWE-250) might allow an attacker to specify an input filename that is not directly readable by the attacker, but is accessible to the privileged program. A buffer overflow (CWE-119) might give an attacker control over nearby memory locations that are related to pathnames, but were not directly modifiable by the attacker.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n- **CVE-2008-5748:** Chain: external control of values for user's desired language and theme enables path traversal.\n- **CVE-2008-5764:** Chain: external control of user's target language enables remote file inclusion.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nZip Slip: \"Zip slip\" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282].

They are the combination of multiple elements: file or directory permissions, filename predictability, race conditions, and in some cases, a design limitation in which there is no mechanism for performing atomic file creation operations.\n\n\nSome potential factors are race conditions, permissions, and predictability.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-1386:** Some versions of Perl follow symbolic links when running with the -e option, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.\n- **CVE-2000-1178:** Text editor follows symbolic links when creating a rescue copy during an abnormal exit, which allows local users to overwrite the files of other users.\n- **CVE-2004-0217:** Antivirus update allows local users to create or append to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a logfile.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-38: Path Traversal: '\\absolute\\pathname\\here'\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product accepts input in the form of a backslash absolute path ('\\absolute\\pathname\\here') without appropriate validation, which can allow an attacker to traverse the file system to unintended locations or access arbitrary files.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-36\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-1263:** Mail client allows remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary files via an e-mail message containing a uuencoded attachment that specifies the full pathname for the file to be modified.\n- **CVE-2003-0753:** Remote attackers can read arbitrary files via a full pathname to the target file in config parameter.\n- **CVE-2002-1525:** Remote attackers can read arbitrary files via an absolute pathname.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-182: Collapse of Data into Unsafe Value\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product filters data in a way that causes it to be reduced or \"collapsed\" into an unsafe value that violates an expected security property.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-693\nCanPrecede -> CWE-33\nCanPrecede -> CWE-34\nCanPrecede -> CWE-35\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Overlaps regular expressions, although an implementation might not necessarily use regexp's.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2004-0815:** \"/.////\" in pathname collapses to absolute path.\n- **CVE-2005-3123:** \"/.//..//////././\" is collapsed into \"/.././\" after \"..\" and \"//\" sequences are removed.\n- **CVE-2002-0325:** \".../...//\" collapsed to \"...\" due to removal of \"./\" in web server.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-39: Path Traversal: 'C:dirname'\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product accepts input that contains a drive letter or Windows volume letter ('C:dirname') that potentially redirects access to an unintended location or arbitrary file.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-36\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-0038:** Remote attackers can read arbitrary files by specifying the drive letter in the requested URL.\n- **CVE-2001-0255:** FTP server allows remote attackers to list arbitrary directories by using the \"ls\" command and including the drive letter name (e.g. C:) in the requested pathname.\n- **CVE-2001-0687:** FTP server allows a remote attacker to retrieve privileged system information by specifying arbitrary paths.\n\n",
