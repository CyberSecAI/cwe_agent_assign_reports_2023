Availability, integrity, or confidentiality of an application programming workstation might be compromised by attacks using these vulnerabilities.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## WEAKNESS: 'heap buffer overflow'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1. CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (Score: 332.42)\n\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data....\n\n### 2. CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 299.34)\n\nA heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc()....\n\n### 3. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 298.17)\n\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to st...\n\n### 4. CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read (Score: 294.74)\n\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....\n\n### 5. CWE-126: Buffer Over-read (Score: 278.08)\n\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer....\n\n## WEAKNESS: 'read access violation'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1. CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (Score: 332.42)\n\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary.

CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference (Score: 244.65)\n\nThe product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL....\n\n### 4. CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write (Score: 238.45)\n\nThe product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....\n\n### 5. CWE-20: Improper Input Validation (Score: 230.32)\n\nThe product receives input or data, but it does\n        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the\n        properties that are required to process the data safely and\n        correctly....\n\n## VECTOR: 'manipulated PC Worx or Config+ files'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this VECTOR:\n\n### 1.
