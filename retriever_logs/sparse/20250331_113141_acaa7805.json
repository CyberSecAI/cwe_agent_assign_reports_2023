This can result in unauthorized execution of system commands with root privileges due to **improper access control** **command injection**.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **improper access control**\n- **weakness:** **command injection**\n- **impact:** unauthorized execution of system commands\n- **product:** Festo Controller CECC-X-M1 product family\n- **version:** multiple versions\n- **component:** http-endpoint cecc-x-acknerr-request POST request\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-30310:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation on the \"cecc-x-acknerr-request\" HTTP endpoint of the Festo CECC-X-M1 controller. Specifically, the endpoint does not check for port syntax.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. The lack of port syntax checking allows an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands into the request.\n*   **Improper Access Control:** The vulnerability is further categorized under \"Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863)\", highlighting that the system doesn't properly control access to command execution functionality.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands with root privileges.\n*   **Full System Compromise:** The ability to run commands with root privileges means an attacker could potentially take complete control of the affected device.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network-Based:** The attack vector is network-based, specifically through HTTP POST requests.\n*   **Pre-Authentication:** The vulnerability is pre-authentication, meaning an attacker does not need to be authenticated to the webserver to exploit it.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected device's web server. This could be through the local network or, if the device is exposed, over the internet.\n*  **No Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Summary**\n\nCVE-2022-30310 is a high-severity vulnerability affecting the Festo CECC-X-M1 controller family. It allows unauthenticated attackers with network access to execute arbitrary system commands as root by sending crafted HTTP POST requests to the \"cecc-x-acknerr-request\" endpoint. The lack of input validation for port syntax is the core issue allowing command injection.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 77 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') | Class | Allowed-with-Review | alternate_terms | 1.000 |\n| 2 | 78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | Base | Allowed | alternate_terms | 0.700 |\n| 3 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.305 |\n| 4 | 306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.257 |\n| 5 | 20 | Improper Input Validation | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.247 |\n| 6 | 671 | Lack of Administrator Control over Security | Class | Allowed-with-Review | dense | 0.549 |\n| 7 | 184 | Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 94 | Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') | Base | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.241 |\n| 9 | 269 | Improper Privilege Management | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.240 |\n| 10 | 287 | Improper Authentication | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.240 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of a command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany protocols and products have their own custom command language. While OS or shell command strings are frequently discovered and targeted, developers may not realize that these other command languages might also be vulnerable to attacks.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nCommand injection: an attack-oriented phrase for this weakness. Note: often used when \"OS command injection\" (CWE-78) was intended.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-74\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** CWE-77 is often misused when OS command injection (CWE-78) was intended instead [REF-1287].\n**Comments:** Ensure that the analysis focuses on the root-cause error that allows the execution of commands, as there are many weaknesses that can lead to this consequence. See Terminology Notes. If the weakness involves a command language besides OS shell invocation, then CWE-77 could be used.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-78: OS Command Injection\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nThe \"command injection\" phrase carries different meanings, either as an attack or as a technical impact. The most common usage of \"command injection\" refers to the more-accurate OS command injection (CWE-78), but there are many command languages.\n\n\nIn vulnerability-focused analysis, the phrase may refer to any situation in which the adversary can execute commands of their own choosing, i.e., the focus is on the risk and/or technical impact of exploitation. Many proof-of-concept exploits focus on the ability to execute commands and may emphasize \"command injection.\" However, there are dozens of weaknesses that can allow execution of commands. That is, the ability to execute commands could be resultant from another weakness.\n\n\nTo some, \"command injection\" can include cases in which the functionality intentionally allows the user to specify an entire command, which is then executed. In this case, the root cause weakness might be related to missing or incorrect authorization, since an adversary should not be able to specify arbitrary commands, but some users or admins are allowed.\n\n\nCWE-77 and its descendants are specifically focused on behaviors in which the product is intentionally building a command to execute, and the adversary can inject separators into the command or otherwise change the command being executed.\n\n\n**[Other]** \n\nCommand injection is a common problem with wrapper programs.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-1509:** injection of sed script syntax (\"sed injection\")\n- **CVE-2024-5184:** API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.\n- **CVE-2020-11698:** anti-spam product allows injection of SNMP commands into confiuration file\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nShell injection\nShell metacharacters\nOS Command Injection\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-88\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** The \"OS command injection\" phrase carries different meanings to different people. For some people, it only refers to cases in which the attacker injects command separators into arguments for an application-controlled program that is being invoked. For some people, it refers to any type of attack that can allow the attacker to execute OS commands of their own choosing. This usage could include untrusted search path weaknesses (CWE-426) that cause the application to find and execute an attacker-controlled program. Further complicating the issue is the case when argument injection (CWE-88) allows alternate command-line switches or options to be inserted into the command line, such as an \"-exec\" switch whose purpose may be to execute the subsequent argument as a command (this -exec switch exists in the UNIX \"find\" command, for example). In this latter case, however, CWE-88 could be regarded as the primary weakness in a chain with CWE-78.\n\n**[Research Gap]** More investigation is needed into the distinction between the OS command injection variants, including the role with argument injection (CWE-88). Equivalent distinctions may exist in other injection-related problems such as SQL injection.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-10987:** OS command injection in Wi-Fi router, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-10221:** Template functionality in network configuration management tool allows OS command injection, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-9054:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in username parameter, leading to OS command injection (CWE-78), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.\n- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default \"Allow\" configuration for its authorization settings.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-31260:** Chain: a digital asset management program has an undisclosed backdoor in the legacy version of a PHP script (CWE-912) that could allow an unauthenticated user to export metadata (CWE-306)\n- **CVE-2022-29951:** TCP-based protocol in Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) has no authentication.\n- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input or data, but it does\n        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the\n        properties that are required to process the data safely and\n        correctly.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nInput validation is a frequently-used technique for checking potentially dangerous inputs in order to ensure that the inputs are safe for processing within the code, or when communicating with other components. When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nInput validation is not the only technique for processing input, however. Other techniques attempt to transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well (see CWE-138 for more examples.)\n\n\nInput validation can be applied to:\n\n\n  - raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.\n\n  - metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size\n\nData can be simple or structured. Structured data can be composed of many nested layers, composed of combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or structured data.\n\nMany properties of raw data or metadata may need to be validated upon entry into the code, such as:\n\n\n  - specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.\n\n  - implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size\n\n  - indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures\n\n  - symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.\n\n  - well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax \n\n  - lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token\n\n  - specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)\n\n  - consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.\n\n  - conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic \n\n  - equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same\n\n  - authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data\n\nImplied or derived properties of data must often be calculated or inferred by the code itself. Errors in deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor to improper input validation. \n\nNote that \"input validation\" has very different meanings to different people, or within different classification schemes. Caution must be used when referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it. For example, some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control to an attacker over an input when they should not be able to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred to as input validation.\n\n\nFinally, it is important to emphasize that the distinctions between input validation and output escaping are often blurred, and developers must be careful to understand the difference, including how input validation is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, this valid name cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\nPeerOf -> CWE-345\nCanPrecede -> CWE-22\nCanPrecede -> CWE-41\nCanPrecede -> CWE-74\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-770\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis. It is also a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Consider lower-level children such as Improper Use of Validation Framework (CWE-1173) or improper validation involving specific types or properties of input such as Specified Quantity (CWE-1284); Specified Index, Position, or Offset (CWE-1285); Syntactic Correctness (CWE-1286); Specified Type (CWE-1287); Consistency within Input (CWE-1288); or Unsafe Equivalence (CWE-1289).\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-1284: Specified Quantity\n- CWE-1285: Specified Index, Position, or Offset\n- CWE-1286: Syntactic Correctness\n- CWE-1287: Specified Type\n- CWE-1288: Consistency within Input\n- CWE-1289: Unsafe Equivalence\n- CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nCWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.\n\n\n**[Maintenance]** As of 2020, this entry is used more often than preferred, and it is a source of frequent confusion. It is being actively modified for CWE 4.1 and subsequent versions.\n\n**[Maintenance]** Concepts such as validation, data transformation, and neutralization are being refined, so relationships between CWE-20 and other entries such as CWE-707 may change in future versions, along with an update to the Vulnerability Theory document.\n\n**[Maintenance]** Input validation - whether missing or incorrect - is such an essential and widespread part of secure development that it is implicit in many different weaknesses. Traditionally, problems such as buffer overflows and XSS have been classified as input validation problems by many security professionals. However, input validation is not necessarily the only protection mechanism available for avoiding such problems, and in some cases it is not even sufficient. The CWE team has begun capturing these subtleties in chains within the Research Concepts view (CWE-1000), but more work is needed.\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nThe \"input validation\" term is extremely common, but it is used in many different ways. In some cases its usage can obscure the real underlying weakness or otherwise hide chaining and composite relationships.\n\n\nSome people use \"input validation\" as a general term that covers many different neutralization techniques for ensuring that input is appropriate, such as filtering, canonicalization, and escaping. Others use the term in a more narrow context to simply mean \"checking if an input conforms to expectations without changing it.\" CWE uses this more narrow interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n- **CVE-2021-30860:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) leads to integer overflow (CWE-190) in mobile OS, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-671: Lack of Administrator Control over Security\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses security features in a way that prevents the product's administrator from tailoring security settings to reflect the environment in which the product is being used. This introduces resultant weaknesses or prevents it from operating at a level of security that is desired by the administrator.\n\n### Extended Description\nIf the product's administrator does not have the ability to manage security-related decisions at all times, then protecting the product from outside threats - including the product's developer - can become impossible. For example, a hard-coded account name and password cannot be changed by the administrator, thus exposing that product to attacks that the administrator can not prevent.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-657\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29953:** Condition Monitor firmware has a maintenance interface with hard-coded credentials\n- **CVE-2000-0127:** GUI configuration tool does not enable a security option when a checkbox is selected, although that option is honored when manually set in the configuration file.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDenylist / Deny List: This is used by CWE and CAPEC instead of other commonly-used terms. Its counterpart is allowlist.\nBlocklist / Block List: This is often used by security tools such as firewalls, email or web gateways, proxies, etc.\nBlacklist / Black List: This term is frequently used, but usage has been declining as organizations have started to adopt other terms.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-693\nChildOf -> CWE-1023\nCanPrecede -> CWE-79\nCanPrecede -> CWE-78\nCanPrecede -> CWE-434\nCanPrecede -> CWE-98\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nMultiple interpretation errors can indirectly introduce inputs that should be disallowed. For example, a list of dangerous shell metacharacters might not include a metacharacter that only has meaning in one particular shell, not all of them; or a check for XSS manipulations might ignore an unusual construct that is supported by one web browser, but not others.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the \"\\\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.\n- **CVE-2008-2309:** product uses a denylist to identify potentially dangerous content, allowing attacker to bypass a warning\n- **CVE-2005-2782:** PHP remote file inclusion in web application that filters \"http\" and \"https\" URLs, but not \"ftp\".\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen a product allows a user's input to contain code syntax, it might be possible for an attacker to craft the code in such a way that it will alter the intended control flow of the product. Such an alteration could lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nInjection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-913\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This entry is frequently misused for vulnerabilities with a technical impact of \"code execution,\" which does not by itself indicate a root cause weakness, since dozens of weaknesses can enable code execution.\n**Comments:** This weakness only applies when the product's functionality intentionally constructs all or part of a code segment. It could be that executing code could be the result of other weaknesses that do not involve the construction of code segments.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n- Frequent Misinterpretation\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-29374:** Math component in an LLM framework translates user input into a Python expression that is input into the Python exec() method, allowing code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n- **CVE-2024-5565:** Python-based library uses an LLM prompt containing user input to dynamically generate code that is then fed as input into the Python exec() method, allowing code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n- **CVE-2024-4181:** Framework for LLM applications allows eval injection via a crafted response from a hosting provider.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-269 is commonly misused. It can be conflated with \"privilege escalation,\" which is a technical impact that is listed in many low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis.\n**Comments:** If an error or mistake allows privilege escalation, then use the CWE ID for that mistake. Avoid using CWE-269 when only phrases such as \"privilege escalation\" or \"gain privileges\" are available, as these indicate technical impact of the vulnerability - not the root cause weakness.

    "base_query": "## Vulnerability Description\nIn Festo Controller CECC-X-M1 product family in multiple versions, the http-endpoint cecc-x-acknerr-request POST request doesnt check for port syntax. This can result in unauthorized execution of system commands with root privileges due to **improper access control** **command injection**.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **improper access control**\n- **weakness:** **command injection**\n- **impact:** unauthorized execution of system commands\n- **product:** Festo Controller CECC-X-M1 product family\n- **version:** multiple versions\n- **component:** http-endpoint cecc-x-acknerr-request POST request\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-30310:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation on the \"cecc-x-acknerr-request\" HTTP endpoint of the Festo CECC-X-M1 controller. Specifically, the endpoint does not check for port syntax.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. The lack of port syntax checking allows an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands into the request.\n*   **Improper Access Control:** The vulnerability is further categorized under \"Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863)\", highlighting that the system doesn't properly control access to command execution functionality.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands with root privileges.\n*   **Full System Compromise:** The ability to run commands with root privileges means an attacker could potentially take complete control of the affected device.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network-Based:** The attack vector is network-based, specifically through HTTP POST requests.\n*   **Pre-Authentication:** The vulnerability is pre-authentication, meaning an attacker does not need to be authenticated to the webserver to exploit it.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected device's web server. This could be through the local network or, if the device is exposed, over the internet.\n*  **No Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Summary**\n\nCVE-2022-30310 is a high-severity vulnerability affecting the Festo CECC-X-M1 controller family. It allows unauthenticated attackers with network access to execute arbitrary system commands as root by sending crafted HTTP POST requests to the \"cecc-x-acknerr-request\" endpoint. The lack of input validation for port syntax is the core issue allowing command injection.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 77 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') | Class | Allowed-with-Review | alternate_terms | 1.000 |\n| 2 | 78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | Base | Allowed | alternate_terms | 0.700 |\n| 3 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.305 |\n| 4 | 306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.257 |\n| 5 | 20 | Improper Input Validation | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.247 |\n| 6 | 671 | Lack of Administrator Control over Security | Class | Allowed-with-Review | dense | 0.549 |\n| 7 | 184 | Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 94 | Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') | Base | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.241 |\n| 9 | 269 | Improper Privilege Management | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.240 |\n| 10 | 287 | Improper Authentication | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.240 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of a command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany protocols and products have their own custom command language. While OS or shell command strings are frequently discovered and targeted, developers may not realize that these other command languages might also be vulnerable to attacks.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nCommand injection: an attack-oriented phrase for this weakness. Note: often used when \"OS command injection\" (CWE-78) was intended.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-74\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** CWE-77 is often misused when OS command injection (CWE-78) was intended instead [REF-1287].\n**Comments:** Ensure that the analysis focuses on the root-cause error that allows the execution of commands, as there are many weaknesses that can lead to this consequence. See Terminology Notes. If the weakness involves a command language besides OS shell invocation, then CWE-77 could be used.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-78: OS Command Injection\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nThe \"command injection\" phrase carries different meanings, either as an attack or as a technical impact. The most common usage of \"command injection\" refers to the more-accurate OS command injection (CWE-78), but there are many command languages.\n\n\nIn vulnerability-focused analysis, the phrase may refer to any situation in which the adversary can execute commands of their own choosing, i.e., the focus is on the risk and/or technical impact of exploitation. Many proof-of-concept exploits focus on the ability to execute commands and may emphasize \"command injection.\" However, there are dozens of weaknesses that can allow execution of commands. That is, the ability to execute commands could be resultant from another weakness.\n\n\nTo some, \"command injection\" can include cases in which the functionality intentionally allows the user to specify an entire command, which is then executed. In this case, the root cause weakness might be related to missing or incorrect authorization, since an adversary should not be able to specify arbitrary commands, but some users or admins are allowed.\n\n\nCWE-77 and its descendants are specifically focused on behaviors in which the product is intentionally building a command to execute, and the adversary can inject separators into the command or otherwise change the command being executed.\n\n\n**[Other]** \n\nCommand injection is a common problem with wrapper programs.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-1509:** injection of sed script syntax (\"sed injection\")\n- **CVE-2024-5184:** API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.\n- **CVE-2020-11698:** anti-spam product allows injection of SNMP commands into confiuration file\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nShell injection\nShell metacharacters\nOS Command Injection\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-88\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** The \"OS command injection\" phrase carries different meanings to different people. For some people, it only refers to cases in which the attacker injects command separators into arguments for an application-controlled program that is being invoked. For some people, it refers to any type of attack that can allow the attacker to execute OS commands of their own choosing. This usage could include untrusted search path weaknesses (CWE-426) that cause the application to find and execute an attacker-controlled program. Further complicating the issue is the case when argument injection (CWE-88) allows alternate command-line switches or options to be inserted into the command line, such as an \"-exec\" switch whose purpose may be to execute the subsequent argument as a command (this -exec switch exists in the UNIX \"find\" command, for example). In this latter case, however, CWE-88 could be regarded as the primary weakness in a chain with CWE-78.\n\n**[Research Gap]** More investigation is needed into the distinction between the OS command injection variants, including the role with argument injection (CWE-88). Equivalent distinctions may exist in other injection-related problems such as SQL injection.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-10987:** OS command injection in Wi-Fi router, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-10221:** Template functionality in network configuration management tool allows OS command injection, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-9054:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in username parameter, leading to OS command injection (CWE-78), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community.

When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nInput validation is not the only technique for processing input, however. Other techniques attempt to transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well (see CWE-138 for more examples.)\n\n\nInput validation can be applied to:\n\n\n  - raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.\n\n  - metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size\n\nData can be simple or structured. Structured data can be composed of many nested layers, composed of combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or structured data.\n\nMany properties of raw data or metadata may need to be validated upon entry into the code, such as:\n\n\n  - specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.\n\n  - implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size\n\n  - indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures\n\n  - symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.\n\n  - well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax \n\n  - lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token\n\n  - specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)\n\n  - consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.\n\n  - conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic \n\n  - equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same\n\n  - authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data\n\nImplied or derived properties of data must often be calculated or inferred by the code itself. Errors in deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor to improper input validation. \n\nNote that \"input validation\" has very different meanings to different people, or within different classification schemes. Caution must be used when referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it. For example, some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control to an attacker over an input when they should not be able to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred to as input validation.\n\n\nFinally, it is important to emphasize that the distinctions between input validation and output escaping are often blurred, and developers must be careful to understand the difference, including how input validation is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, this valid name cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\nPeerOf -> CWE-345\nCanPrecede -> CWE-22\nCanPrecede -> CWE-41\nCanPrecede -> CWE-74\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-770\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis. It is also a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Consider lower-level children such as Improper Use of Validation Framework (CWE-1173) or improper validation involving specific types or properties of input such as Specified Quantity (CWE-1284); Specified Index, Position, or Offset (CWE-1285); Syntactic Correctness (CWE-1286); Specified Type (CWE-1287); Consistency within Input (CWE-1288); or Unsafe Equivalence (CWE-1289).\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-1284: Specified Quantity\n- CWE-1285: Specified Index, Position, or Offset\n- CWE-1286: Syntactic Correctness\n- CWE-1287: Specified Type\n- CWE-1288: Consistency within Input\n- CWE-1289: Unsafe Equivalence\n- CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nCWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.\n\n\n**[Maintenance]** As of 2020, this entry is used more often than preferred, and it is a source of frequent confusion. It is being actively modified for CWE 4.1 and subsequent versions.\n\n**[Maintenance]** Concepts such as validation, data transformation, and neutralization are being refined, so relationships between CWE-20 and other entries such as CWE-707 may change in future versions, along with an update to the Vulnerability Theory document.\n\n**[Maintenance]** Input validation - whether missing or incorrect - is such an essential and widespread part of secure development that it is implicit in many different weaknesses. Traditionally, problems such as buffer overflows and XSS have been classified as input validation problems by many security professionals. However, input validation is not necessarily the only protection mechanism available for avoiding such problems, and in some cases it is not even sufficient. The CWE team has begun capturing these subtleties in chains within the Research Concepts view (CWE-1000), but more work is needed.\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nThe \"input validation\" term is extremely common, but it is used in many different ways. In some cases its usage can obscure the real underlying weakness or otherwise hide chaining and composite relationships.\n\n\nSome people use \"input validation\" as a general term that covers many different neutralization techniques for ensuring that input is appropriate, such as filtering, canonicalization, and escaping. Others use the term in a more narrow context to simply mean \"checking if an input conforms to expectations without changing it.\" CWE uses this more narrow interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n- **CVE-2021-30860:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) leads to integer overflow (CWE-190) in mobile OS, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-671: Lack of Administrator Control over Security\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses security features in a way that prevents the product's administrator from tailoring security settings to reflect the environment in which the product is being used. This introduces resultant weaknesses or prevents it from operating at a level of security that is desired by the administrator.\n\n### Extended Description\nIf the product's administrator does not have the ability to manage security-related decisions at all times, then protecting the product from outside threats - including the product's developer - can become impossible. For example, a hard-coded account name and password cannot be changed by the administrator, thus exposing that product to attacks that the administrator can not prevent.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-657\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29953:** Condition Monitor firmware has a maintenance interface with hard-coded credentials\n- **CVE-2000-0127:** GUI configuration tool does not enable a security option when a checkbox is selected, although that option is honored when manually set in the configuration file.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDenylist / Deny List: This is used by CWE and CAPEC instead of other commonly-used terms.

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nMultiple interpretation errors can indirectly introduce inputs that should be disallowed. For example, a list of dangerous shell metacharacters might not include a metacharacter that only has meaning in one particular shell, not all of them; or a check for XSS manipulations might ignore an unusual construct that is supported by one web browser, but not others.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the \"\\\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.\n- **CVE-2008-2309:** product uses a denylist to identify potentially dangerous content, allowing attacker to bypass a warning\n- **CVE-2005-2782:** PHP remote file inclusion in web application that filters \"http\" and \"https\" URLs, but not \"ftp\".\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen a product allows a user's input to contain code syntax, it might be possible for an attacker to craft the code in such a way that it will alter the intended control flow of the product. Such an alteration could lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nInjection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-913\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This entry is frequently misused for vulnerabilities with a technical impact of \"code execution,\" which does not by itself indicate a root cause weakness, since dozens of weaknesses can enable code execution.\n**Comments:** This weakness only applies when the product's functionality intentionally constructs all or part of a code segment. It could be that executing code could be the result of other weaknesses that do not involve the construction of code segments.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n- Frequent Misinterpretation\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-29374:** Math component in an LLM framework translates user input into a Python expression that is input into the Python exec() method, allowing code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n- **CVE-2024-5565:** Python-based library uses an LLM prompt containing user input to dynamically generate code that is then fed as input into the Python exec() method, allowing code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n- **CVE-2024-4181:** Framework for LLM applications allows eval injection via a crafted response from a hosting provider.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-269 is commonly misused. It can be conflated with \"privilege escalation,\" which is a technical impact that is listed in many low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis.\n**Comments:** If an error or mistake allows privilege escalation, then use the CWE ID for that mistake. Avoid using CWE-269 when only phrases such as \"privilege escalation\" or \"gain privileges\" are available, as these indicate technical impact of the vulnerability - not the root cause weakness. If the root cause seems to be directly related to privileges, then examine the children of CWE-269 for additional hints, such as Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250) or Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266).\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-1555:** Terminal privileges are not reset when a user logs out.\n- **CVE-2001-1514:** Does not properly pass security context to child processes in certain cases, allows privilege escalation.\n- **CVE-2001-0128:** Does not properly compute roles.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-287: Improper Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nWhen an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nauthentification: An alternate term is \"authentification\", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.\nAuthN: \"AuthN\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authentication\" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from \"AuthZ,\" which is an abbreviation of \"authorization.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\nAuthC: \"AuthC\" is used as an abbreviation of \"authentication,\" but it appears to used less frequently than \"AuthN.\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication\n- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.\n- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).\n\n"
