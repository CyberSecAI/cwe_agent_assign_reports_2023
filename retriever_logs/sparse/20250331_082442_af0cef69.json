Specifically, the code failed to properly verify that the `user_hash` and `user_id` parameters submitted by the user matched the existing user's data. This allowed for the possibility of a malicious user tampering with these hidden inputs to impersonate another user or potentially escalate privileges.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The primary weakness was the lack of proper server-side validation of the `user_hash` and `user_id` parameters. The code was vulnerable to \"id request spoofing,\" where a user could manipulate hidden form fields to submit different values than their actual user data.\n*   **Hidden Input Tampering:** The vulnerability allowed an attacker to manipulate hidden form fields related to user authentication (`user_hash`, `user_id`).\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **User Impersonation:** An attacker could potentially modify another user's profile data by impersonating them, leading to unauthorized changes.\n*   **Potential Privilege Escalation:** While not explicitly detailed, this type of vulnerability could potentially be combined with other weaknesses to achieve privilege escalation.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Manipulated HTTP Request:** An attacker could intercept and modify the HTTP request sent to the server when updating a user's profile. This involves altering the values of the `user_hash` and `user_id` parameters within the request.\n*   **Form Tampering:** This could also be done through manipulating the form before it is submitted, by changing the hidden input fields.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker would need to be a registered and authenticated user on the PHPFusion system.\n*   **Knowledge of Target User ID:** The attacker would need to know or be able to guess the user ID of the target user they wish to impersonate.\n*   **Ability to intercept or manipulate HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to have the ability to modify the user profile update request to change the values of hidden fields.\n\n**Additional details from the provided content:**\n\n*   The commit message \"Security fixes\" indicates the vulnerability was security-related.\n*   The changes in `includes/classes/PHPFusion/UserFieldsInput.php` show that the fix involved adding checks to ensure the `user_hash` and `user_id` parameters match the current user session.\n*   The commit was released in PHPFusion version 9.10.30\n\nThis commit aims to prevent spoofing of user IDs and hashes during user updates.\n\nThe huntr.dev link (<https://huntr.dev/bounties/b3f888d2-5c71-4682-8287-42613401fd5a/>) further confirms that this fix was made as a result of a security vulnerability report.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe commit addresses a vulnerability in PHPFusion that allowed an attacker to tamper with user IDs and hashes when updating user profiles by modifying hidden form fields. This could allow for impersonation and potential privilege escalation. The fix involves strengthening server-side input validation of `user_hash` and `user_id` parameters, ensuring they match the authenticated user's data.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 620 | Unverified Password Change | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.216 |\n| 2 | 1390 | Weak Authentication | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.081 |\n| 3 | 283 | Unverified Ownership | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.080 |\n| 4 | 36 | Absolute Path Traversal | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.080 |\n| 5 | 212 | Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.079 |\n| 6 | 836 | Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.467 |\n| 7 | 201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 285 | Improper Authorization | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.079 |\n| 9 | 1188 | Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.077 |\n| 10 | 472 | External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.075 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-620: Unverified Password Change\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nWhen setting a new password for a user, the product does not require knowledge of the original password, or using another form of authentication.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis could be used by an attacker to change passwords for another user, thus gaining the privileges associated with that user.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2007-0681:** Web app allows remote attackers to change the passwords of arbitrary users without providing the original password, and possibly perform other unauthorized actions.\n- **CVE-2000-0944:** Web application password change utility doesn't check the original password.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAttackers may be able to bypass weak authentication faster and/or with less effort than expected.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).\n- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication\n- **CVE-2021-3116:** Chain: Python-based HTTP Proxy server uses the wrong boolean operators (CWE-480) causing an incorrect comparison (CWE-697) that identifies an authN failure if all three conditions are met instead of only one, allowing bypass of the proxy authentication (CWE-1390)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-283: Unverified Ownership\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly verify that a critical resource is owned by the proper entity.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-282\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This overlaps insufficient comparison, verification errors, permissions, and privileges.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-0178:** Program does not verify the owner of a UNIX socket that is used for sending a password.\n- **CVE-2004-2012:** Owner of special device not checked, allowing root.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as \"/abs/path\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-22\nChildOf -> CWE-22\nChildOf -> CWE-22\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-31503:** Python package constructs filenames using an unsafe os.path.join call on untrusted input, allowing absolute path traversal because os.path.join resets the pathname to an absolute path that is specified as part of the input.\n- **CVE-2002-1345:** Multiple FTP clients write arbitrary files via absolute paths in server responses\n- **CVE-2001-1269:** ZIP file extractor allows full path\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nResources that may contain sensitive data include documents, packets, messages, databases, etc. While this data may be useful to an individual user or small set of users who share the resource, it may need to be removed before the resource can be shared outside of the trusted group. The process of removal is sometimes called cleansing or scrubbing.\n\n\nFor example, a product for editing documents might not remove sensitive data such as reviewer comments or the local pathname where the document is stored. Or, a proxy might not remove an internal IP address from headers before making an outgoing request to an Internet site.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-669\nChildOf -> CWE-669\nCanPrecede -> CWE-201\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This entry is intended to be different from resultant information leaks, including those that occur from improper buffer initialization and reuse, improper encryption, interaction errors, and multiple interpretation errors. This entry could be regarded as a privacy leak, depending on the type of information that is leaked.\n\n**[Relationship]** There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).\n\n**[Terminology]** The terms \"cleansing\" and \"scrubbing\" have multiple uses within computing. In information security, these are used for the removal of sensitive data, but they are also used for the modification of incoming/outgoing data so that it conforms to specifications.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release\n- **CVE-2005-0406:** Some image editors modify a JPEG image, but the original EXIF thumbnail image is left intact within the JPEG. (Also an interaction error).\n- **CVE-2002-0704:** NAT feature in firewall leaks internal IP addresses in ICMP error messages.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-836: Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product records password hashes in a data store, receives a hash of a password from a client, and compares the supplied hash to the hash obtained from the data store.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nSome authentication mechanisms rely on the client to generate the hash for a password, possibly to reduce load on the server or avoid sending the password across the network. However, when the client is used to generate the hash, an attacker can bypass the authentication by obtaining a copy of the hash, e.g. by using SQL injection to compromise a database of authentication credentials, or by exploiting an information exposure. The attacker could then use a modified client to replay the stolen hash without having knowledge of the original password.\n\n\nAs a result, the server-side comparison against a client-side hash does not provide any more security than the use of passwords without hashing.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\nPeerOf -> CWE-602\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2009-1283:** Product performs authentication with user-supplied password hashes that can be obtained from a separate SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2009-1282).\n- **CVE-2005-3435:** Product allows attackers to bypass authentication by obtaining the password hash for another user and specifying the hash in the pwd argument.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-209\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-202\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** Sensitive information could include data that is sensitive in and of itself (such as credentials or private messages), or otherwise useful in the further exploitation of the system (such as internal file system structure).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\nWhen access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information\n- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.\n- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nDevelopers often choose default values that leave the product as open and easy to use as possible out-of-the-box, under the assumption that the administrator can (or should) change the default value. However, this ease-of-use comes at a cost when the default is insecure and the administrator does not change it.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1419\nChildOf -> CWE-665\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry improves organization of concepts under initialization. The typical CWE model is to cover \"Missing\" and \"Incorrect\" behaviors. Arguably, this entry could be named as \"Incorrect\" instead of \"Insecure.\" This might be changed in the near future.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-36349:** insecure default variable initialization in BIOS firmware for a hardware board allows DoS\n- **CVE-2022-42467:** A generic database browser interface has a default mode that exposes a web server to the network, allowing queries to the database.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nIf a web product does not properly protect assumed-immutable values from modification in hidden form fields, parameters, cookies, or URLs, this can lead to modification of critical data. Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.\n\n\nFor example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAssumed-Immutable Parameter Tampering\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-642\nChildOf -> CWE-471\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is a primary weakness for many other weaknesses and functional consequences, including XSS, SQL injection, path disclosure, and file inclusion.\n\n**[Theoretical]** This is a technology-specific MAID problem.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-0108:** Forum product allows spoofed messages of other users via hidden form fields for name and e-mail address.\n- **CVE-2000-0253:** Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.\n- **CVE-2000-0254:** Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.\n\n",
