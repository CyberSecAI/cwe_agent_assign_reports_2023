As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nImproper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.\n\n\nMost products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, \"GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\" is a structured message containing a command (\"GET\") with a single argument (\"/index.html\") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (\"HTTP/1.1\").\n\n\nIf an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOutput Sanitization\nOutput Validation\nOutput Encoding\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\nCanPrecede -> CWE-74\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness is primary to all weaknesses related to injection (CWE-74) since the inherent nature of injection involves the violation of structured messages.\n\n**[Relationship]** \n\nCWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.\n\n\nHowever, input validation is not always sufficient, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a last name is inserted into a query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise neutralized. In this case, stripping the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.\n\n\n**[Terminology]** The usage of the \"encoding\" and \"escaping\" terms varies widely. For example, in some programming languages, the terms are used interchangeably, while other languages provide APIs that use both terms for different tasks. This overlapping usage extends to the Web, such as the \"escape\" JavaScript function whose purpose is stated to be encoding. The concepts of encoding and escaping predate the Web by decades. Given such a context, it is difficult for CWE to adopt a consistent vocabulary that will not be misinterpreted by some constituency.\n\n**[Theoretical]** This is a data/directive boundary error in which data boundaries are not sufficiently enforced before it is sent to a different control sphere.\n\n**[Research Gap]** While many published vulnerabilities are related to insufficient output encoding, there is such an emphasis on input validation as a protection mechanism that the underlying causes are rarely described. Within CVE, the focus is primarily on well-understood issues like cross-site scripting and SQL injection. It is likely that this weakness frequently occurs in custom protocols that support multiple encodings, which are not necessarily detectable with automated techniques.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-41232:** Chain: authentication routine in Go-based agile development product does not escape user name (CWE-116), allowing LDAP injection (CWE-90)\n- **CVE-2008-4636:** OS command injection in backup software using shell metacharacters in a filename; correct behavior would require that this filename could not be changed.\n- **CVE-2008-0769:** Web application does not set the charset when sending a page to a browser, allowing for XSS exploitation when a browser chooses an unexpected encoding.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product generates a query intended to access or manipulate data in a data store such as a database, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that can modify the intended logic of the query.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nDepending on the capabilities of the query language, an attacker could inject additional logic into the query to:\n\n\n  - Modify the intended selection criteria, thus changing which data entities (e.g., records) are returned, modified, or otherwise manipulated\n\n  - Append additional commands to the query\n\n  - Return more entities than intended\n\n  - Return fewer entities than intended\n\n  - Cause entities to be sorted in an unexpected way\n\nThe ability to execute additional commands or change which entities are returned has obvious risks. But when the product logic depends on the order or number of entities, this can also lead to vulnerabilities. For example, if the query expects to return only one entity that specifies an administrative user, but an attacker can change which entities are returned, this could cause the logic to return information for a regular user and incorrectly assume that the user has administrative privileges.\n\nWhile this weakness is most commonly associated with SQL injection, there are many other query languages that are also subject to injection attacks, including HTSQL, LDAP, DQL, XQuery, Xpath, and \"NoSQL\" languages.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** It could be argued that data query languages are effectively a command language - albeit with a limited set of commands - and thus any query-language injection issue could be treated as a child of CWE-74. However, CWE-943 is intended to better organize query-oriented issues to separate them from fully-functioning programming languages, and also to provide a more precise identifier for the many query languages that do not have their own CWE identifier.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2014-2503:** Injection using Documentum Query Language (DQL)\n- **CVE-2014-2508:** Injection using Documentum Query Language (DQL)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-564: SQL Injection: Hibernate\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nUsing Hibernate to execute a dynamic SQL statement built with user-controlled input can allow an attacker to modify the statement's meaning or to execute arbitrary SQL commands.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-89\nChildOf -> CWE-89\nChildOf -> CWE-89\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.\n\n### Extended Description\nTwo common programmer assumptions are \"this function call can never fail\" and \"it doesn't matter if this function call fails\". If an attacker can force the function to fail or otherwise return a value that is not expected, then the subsequent program logic could lead to a vulnerability, because the product is not in a state that the programmer assumes. For example, if the program calls a function to drop privileges but does not check the return code to ensure that privileges were successfully dropped, then the program will continue to operate with the higher privileges.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-754\nChildOf -> CWE-754\nCanPrecede -> CWE-476\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-17533:** Chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) of some functions for policy enforcement leads to authorization bypass (CWE-862)\n- **CVE-2020-6078:** Chain: The return value of a function returning a pointer is not checked for success (CWE-252) resulting in the later use of an uninitialized variable (CWE-456) and a null pointer dereference (CWE-476)\n- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nMarshaling, Unmarshaling: Marshaling and unmarshaling are effectively synonyms for serialization and deserialization, respectively.\nPickling, Unpickling: In Python, the \"pickle\" functionality is used to perform serialization and deserialization.\nPHP Object Injection: Some PHP application researchers use this term when attacking unsafe use of the unserialize() function; but it is also used for CWE-915.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-913\nChildOf -> CWE-913\nPeerOf -> CWE-915\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationships between CWE-502 and CWE-915 need further exploration. CWE-915 is more narrowly scoped to object modification, and is not necessarily used for deserialization.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-12799:** chain: bypass of untrusted deserialization issue (CWE-502) by using an assumed-trusted class (CWE-183)\n- **CVE-2015-8103:** Deserialization issue in commonly-used Java library allows remote execution.\n- **CVE-2015-4852:** Deserialization issue in commonly-used Java library allows remote execution.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-836: Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product records password hashes in a data store, receives a hash of a password from a client, and compares the supplied hash to the hash obtained from the data store.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nSome authentication mechanisms rely on the client to generate the hash for a password, possibly to reduce load on the server or avoid sending the password across the network. However, when the client is used to generate the hash, an attacker can bypass the authentication by obtaining a copy of the hash, e.g. by using SQL injection to compromise a database of authentication credentials, or by exploiting an information exposure. The attacker could then use a modified client to replay the stolen hash without having knowledge of the original password.\n\n\nAs a result, the server-side comparison against a client-side hash does not provide any more security than the use of passwords without hashing.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\nPeerOf -> CWE-602\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2009-1283:** Product performs authentication with user-supplied password hashes that can be obtained from a separate SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2009-1282).\n- **CVE-2005-3435:** Product allows attackers to bypass authentication by obtaining the password hash for another user and specifying the hash in the pwd argument.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\nMost languages and protocols have their own special elements such as characters and reserved words. These special elements can carry control implications. If product does not prevent external control or influence over the inclusion of such special elements, the control flow of the program may be altered from what was intended. For example, both Unix and Windows interpret the symbol < (\"less than\") as meaning \"read input from a file\".\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness can be related to interpretation conflicts or interaction errors in intermediaries (such as proxies or application firewalls) when the intermediary's model of an endpoint does not account for protocol-specific special elements.\n\n**[Relationship]** See this entry's children for different types of special elements that have been observed at one point or another. However, it can be difficult to find suitable CVE examples. In an attempt to be complete, CWE includes some types that do not have any associated observed example.\n\n**[Research Gap]** This weakness is probably under-studied for proprietary or custom formats. It is likely that these issues are fairly common in applications that use their own custom format for configuration files, logs, meta-data, messaging, etc. They would only be found by accident or with a focused effort based on an understanding of the format.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-0677:** Read arbitrary files from mail client by providing a special MIME header that is internally used to store pathnames for attachments.\n- **CVE-2000-0703:** Setuid program does not cleanse special escape sequence before sending data to a mail program, causing the mail program to process those sequences.\n- **CVE-2003-0020:** Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.\n\n",

As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nImproper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.\n\n\nMost products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, \"GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\" is a structured message containing a command (\"GET\") with a single argument (\"/index.html\") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (\"HTTP/1.1\").\n\n\nIf an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOutput Sanitization\nOutput Validation\nOutput Encoding\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\nCanPrecede -> CWE-74\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness is primary to all weaknesses related to injection (CWE-74) since the inherent nature of injection involves the violation of structured messages.\n\n**[Relationship]** \n\nCWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.\n\n\nHowever, input validation is not always sufficient, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a last name is inserted into a query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise neutralized. In this case, stripping the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.\n\n\n**[Terminology]** The usage of the \"encoding\" and \"escaping\" terms varies widely. For example, in some programming languages, the terms are used interchangeably, while other languages provide APIs that use both terms for different tasks. This overlapping usage extends to the Web, such as the \"escape\" JavaScript function whose purpose is stated to be encoding. The concepts of encoding and escaping predate the Web by decades. Given such a context, it is difficult for CWE to adopt a consistent vocabulary that will not be misinterpreted by some constituency.\n\n**[Theoretical]** This is a data/directive boundary error in which data boundaries are not sufficiently enforced before it is sent to a different control sphere.\n\n**[Research Gap]** While many published vulnerabilities are related to insufficient output encoding, there is such an emphasis on input validation as a protection mechanism that the underlying causes are rarely described. Within CVE, the focus is primarily on well-understood issues like cross-site scripting and SQL injection. It is likely that this weakness frequently occurs in custom protocols that support multiple encodings, which are not necessarily detectable with automated techniques.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-41232:** Chain: authentication routine in Go-based agile development product does not escape user name (CWE-116), allowing LDAP injection (CWE-90)\n- **CVE-2008-4636:** OS command injection in backup software using shell metacharacters in a filename; correct behavior would require that this filename could not be changed.\n- **CVE-2008-0769:** Web application does not set the charset when sending a page to a browser, allowing for XSS exploitation when a browser chooses an unexpected encoding.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product generates a query intended to access or manipulate data in a data store such as a database, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that can modify the intended logic of the query.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nDepending on the capabilities of the query language, an attacker could inject additional logic into the query to:\n\n\n  - Modify the intended selection criteria, thus changing which data entities (e.g., records) are returned, modified, or otherwise manipulated\n\n  - Append additional commands to the query\n\n  - Return more entities than intended\n\n  - Return fewer entities than intended\n\n  - Cause entities to be sorted in an unexpected way\n\nThe ability to execute additional commands or change which entities are returned has obvious risks. But when the product logic depends on the order or number of entities, this can also lead to vulnerabilities. For example, if the query expects to return only one entity that specifies an administrative user, but an attacker can change which entities are returned, this could cause the logic to return information for a regular user and incorrectly assume that the user has administrative privileges.\n\nWhile this weakness is most commonly associated with SQL injection, there are many other query languages that are also subject to injection attacks, including HTSQL, LDAP, DQL, XQuery, Xpath, and \"NoSQL\" languages.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** It could be argued that data query languages are effectively a command language - albeit with a limited set of commands - and thus any query-language injection issue could be treated as a child of CWE-74. However, CWE-943 is intended to better organize query-oriented issues to separate them from fully-functioning programming languages, and also to provide a more precise identifier for the many query languages that do not have their own CWE identifier.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2014-2503:** Injection using Documentum Query Language (DQL)\n- **CVE-2014-2508:** Injection using Documentum Query Language (DQL)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-564: SQL Injection: Hibernate\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nUsing Hibernate to execute a dynamic SQL statement built with user-controlled input can allow an attacker to modify the statement's meaning or to execute arbitrary SQL commands.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-89\nChildOf -> CWE-89\nChildOf -> CWE-89\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.\n\n### Extended Description\nTwo common programmer assumptions are \"this function call can never fail\" and \"it doesn't matter if this function call fails\". If an attacker can force the function to fail or otherwise return a value that is not expected, then the subsequent program logic could lead to a vulnerability, because the product is not in a state that the programmer assumes. For example, if the program calls a function to drop privileges but does not check the return code to ensure that privileges were successfully dropped, then the program will continue to operate with the higher privileges.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-754\nChildOf -> CWE-754\nCanPrecede -> CWE-476\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-17533:** Chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) of some functions for policy enforcement leads to authorization bypass (CWE-862)\n- **CVE-2020-6078:** Chain: The return value of a function returning a pointer is not checked for success (CWE-252) resulting in the later use of an uninitialized variable (CWE-456) and a null pointer dereference (CWE-476)\n- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nMarshaling, Unmarshaling: Marshaling and unmarshaling are effectively synonyms for serialization and deserialization, respectively.\nPickling, Unpickling: In Python, the \"pickle\" functionality is used to perform serialization and deserialization.\nPHP Object Injection: Some PHP application researchers use this term when attacking unsafe use of the unserialize() function; but it is also used for CWE-915.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-913\nChildOf -> CWE-913\nPeerOf -> CWE-915\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationships between CWE-502 and CWE-915 need further exploration. CWE-915 is more narrowly scoped to object modification, and is not necessarily used for deserialization.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-12799:** chain: bypass of untrusted deserialization issue (CWE-502) by using an assumed-trusted class (CWE-183)\n- **CVE-2015-8103:** Deserialization issue in commonly-used Java library allows remote execution.\n- **CVE-2015-4852:** Deserialization issue in commonly-used Java library allows remote execution.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-836: Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product records password hashes in a data store, receives a hash of a password from a client, and compares the supplied hash to the hash obtained from the data store.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nSome authentication mechanisms rely on the client to generate the hash for a password, possibly to reduce load on the server or avoid sending the password across the network. However, when the client is used to generate the hash, an attacker can bypass the authentication by obtaining a copy of the hash, e.g. by using SQL injection to compromise a database of authentication credentials, or by exploiting an information exposure. The attacker could then use a modified client to replay the stolen hash without having knowledge of the original password.\n\n\nAs a result, the server-side comparison against a client-side hash does not provide any more security than the use of passwords without hashing.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\nPeerOf -> CWE-602\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2009-1283:** Product performs authentication with user-supplied password hashes that can be obtained from a separate SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2009-1282).\n- **CVE-2005-3435:** Product allows attackers to bypass authentication by obtaining the password hash for another user and specifying the hash in the pwd argument.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\nMost languages and protocols have their own special elements such as characters and reserved words. These special elements can carry control implications. If product does not prevent external control or influence over the inclusion of such special elements, the control flow of the program may be altered from what was intended. For example, both Unix and Windows interpret the symbol < (\"less than\") as meaning \"read input from a file\".\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness can be related to interpretation conflicts or interaction errors in intermediaries (such as proxies or application firewalls) when the intermediary's model of an endpoint does not account for protocol-specific special elements.\n\n**[Relationship]** See this entry's children for different types of special elements that have been observed at one point or another. However, it can be difficult to find suitable CVE examples. In an attempt to be complete, CWE includes some types that do not have any associated observed example.\n\n**[Research Gap]** This weakness is probably under-studied for proprietary or custom formats. It is likely that these issues are fairly common in applications that use their own custom format for configuration files, logs, meta-data, messaging, etc. They would only be found by accident or with a focused effort based on an understanding of the format.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-0677:** Read arbitrary files from mail client by providing a special MIME header that is internally used to store pathnames for attachments.\n- **CVE-2000-0703:** Setuid program does not cleanse special escape sequence before sending data to a mail program, causing the mail program to process those sequences.\n- **CVE-2003-0020:** Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.\n\n"
