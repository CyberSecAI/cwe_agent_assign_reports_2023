This flaw affects Blender versions prior to 2.83.19, 2.93.8 and 3.1.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'integer overflow'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 537.05)\n\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to st...\n\n### 2. CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound) (Score: 523.18)\n\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result....\n\n### 3. CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read (Score: 456.29)\n\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....\n\n### 4.
