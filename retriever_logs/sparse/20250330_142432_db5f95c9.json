This allows an attacker to use one AK, EK pair from a real TPM to pass EK validation and give the verifier an AK of a software TPM. A successful attack breaks the entire chain of trust because a not validated AK is used by the verifier. This issue is worse if the validation happens first and then the agent gets added to the verifier because the timing is easier and the verifier does not validate the regcount entry being equal to 1,\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **Keylime does not enforce that the agent registrar data is the same when the tenant uses it for validation of the EK and identity quote and the verifier for validating the integrity quote**\n- **impact:** use one AK, EK pair from a real TPM to pass EK validation and give the verifier an AK of a software TPM\n- **attacker:** attacker\n- **product:** Keylime\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-1053:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from a design flaw in Keylime where the Tenant and Verifier might not use the same registrar data. Specifically, the Verifier was directly fetching registrar data which included the agent's AK (Attestation Key) and mTLS certificate. This created a dependency on the registrar data and a potential inconsistency between the data the tenant and verifier uses.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Data Inconsistency:** The core issue is the potential for the Verifier and Tenant to have differing views of the registrar data, particularly the AK and mTLS certificate.\n*   **Unnecessary Dependency:** The Verifier's reliance on the registrar for data that the Tenant already possesses created an unnecessary dependency.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\nIf the registrar data used by the Tenant and Verifier were to diverge, it could lead to:\n* **Attestation failure**: The verifier might fail to validate the tenant if the AK or mtls certificate doesn't match, resulting in the tenant being rejected, thus impacting functionality.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Data Manipulation (Potential):** While not explicitly stated, an attacker who could manipulate the registrar data could potentially cause a mismatch between the Tenant and Verifier's data.\n*  **MITM attack on registrar**: If an attacker manages to perform a man in the middle attack between the verifier and the registrar, they could potentially alter the data retrieved by the verifier and cause mismatches with the tenant.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Access to Registrar Data (Conditional):**  If data manipulation is considered an attack vector, then an attacker would need to have some form of access or control over the registrar data to trigger the vulnerability, or be able to perform a MITM attack on communication with the registrar.\n\n**Additional details:**\n\n* The fix for the vulnerability involves modifying the `keylime/cloud_verifier_tornado.py` and `keylime/tenant.py` files.  The primary change is that the tenant now provides the AK and mTLS certificate directly to the verifier, removing the verifier's direct dependency on registrar data.\n* The provided content explicitly mentions that the update fixes CVE-2022-1053.\n*   The commit message \"tenant, verifier: let the tenant provide the AK and mTLS certificate\" from the GitHub content is directly related to the vulnerability, further highlighting the root cause and fix.\n*   The Bugzilla link provided is not accessible, but the included description in the update notes confirms that the bug is indeed related to  \"Tenant and Verifier might not use the same registrar data\".\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 1390 | Weak Authentication | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 1.225 |\n| 2 | 296 | Improper Following of a Certificate's Chain of Trust | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.878 |\n| 3 | 295 | Improper Certificate Validation | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.834 |\n| 4 | 345 | Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.766 |\n| 5 | 1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.766 |\n| 6 | 322 | Key Exchange without Entity Authentication | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.474 |\n| 7 | 350 | Reliance on Reverse DNS Resolution for a Security-Critical Action | Variant | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 347 | Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.760 |\n| 9 | 1385 | Missing Origin Validation in WebSockets | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.753 |\n| 10 | 208 | Observable Timing Discrepancy | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.752 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAttackers may be able to bypass weak authentication faster and/or with less effort than expected.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).\n- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication\n- **CVE-2021-3116:** Chain: Python-based HTTP Proxy server uses the wrong boolean operators (CWE-480) causing an incorrect comparison (CWE-697) that identifies an authN failure if all three conditions are met instead of only one, allowing bypass of the proxy authentication (CWE-1390)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-296: Improper Following of a Certificate's Chain of Trust\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not follow, or incorrectly follows, the chain of trust for a certificate back to a trusted root certificate, resulting in incorrect trust of any resource that is associated with that certificate.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nIf a system does not follow the chain of trust of a certificate to a root server, the certificate loses all usefulness as a metric of trust. Essentially, the trust gained from a certificate is derived from a chain of trust -- with a reputable trusted entity at the end of that list. The end user must trust that reputable source, and this reputable source must vouch for the resource in question through the medium of the certificate.\n\n\nIn some cases, this trust traverses several entities who vouch for one another. The entity trusted by the end user is at one end of this trust chain, while the certificate-wielding resource is at the other end of the chain. If the user receives a certificate at the end of one of these trust chains and then proceeds to check only that the first link in the chain, no real trust has been derived, since the entire chain must be traversed back to a trusted source to verify the certificate.\n\n\nThere are several ways in which the chain of trust might be broken, including but not limited to:\n\n\n  - Any certificate in the chain is self-signed, unless it the root.\n\n  - Not every intermediate certificate is checked, starting from the original certificate all the way up to the root certificate.\n\n  - An intermediate, CA-signed certificate does not have the expected Basic Constraints or other important extensions.\n\n  - The root certificate has been compromised or authorized to the wrong party.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-295\nChildOf -> CWE-573\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

In some sense, this is more like a category.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30260:** Distributed Control System (DCS) does not sign firmware images and only relies on insecure checksums for integrity checks\n- **CVE-2022-30267:** Distributed Control System (DCS) does not sign firmware images and only relies on insecure checksums for integrity checks\n- **CVE-2022-30272:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) does not use signatures for firmware images and relies on insecure checksums\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nSpecified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-789\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This may enable an attacker to impersonate an actor by modifying traffic between the two entities. Typically, this involves a victim client that contacts a malicious server that is impersonating a trusted server. If the client skips authentication or ignores an authentication failure, the malicious server may request authentication information from the user. The malicious server can then use this authentication information to log in to the trusted server using the victim's credentials, sniff traffic between the victim and trusted server, etc.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-306\nCanPrecede -> CWE-923\nPeerOf -> CWE-295\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

As a result, the attacker may be able to bypass authentication, cause the wrong hostname to be recorded in log files to hide activities, or perform other attacks.\n\n\nAttackers can spoof DNS names by either (1) compromising a DNS server and modifying its records (sometimes called DNS cache poisoning), or (2) having legitimate control over a DNS server associated with their IP address.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-290\nChildOf -> CWE-807\nCanPrecede -> CWE-923\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

CWE-247 was originally derived from Seven Pernicious Kingdoms, CWE-350 from PLOVER, and CWE-292 from CLASP. All taxonomies focused closely on the use of reverse DNS for authentication of incoming requests.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-1488:** Does not do double-reverse lookup to prevent DNS spoofing.\n- **CVE-2001-1500:** Does not verify reverse-resolved hostnames in DNS.\n- **CVE-2000-1221:** Authentication bypass using spoofed reverse-resolved DNS hostnames.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nChildOf -> CWE-345\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

WebSockets are different than HTTP in that the connections are long-lived, as the channel will remain open until the client or the server is ready to send the message, whereas in HTTP, once the response occurs (which typically happens immediately), the transaction completes. \n\n\nA WebSocket can leverage the existing HTTP protocol over ports 80 and 443, but it is not limited to HTTP. WebSockets can make cross-origin requests that are not restricted by browser-based protection mechanisms such as the Same Origin Policy (SOP) or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). Without explicit origin validation, this makes CSRF attacks more powerful.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nCross-Site WebSocket hijacking (CSWSH): this term is used for attacks that exploit this weakness\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-346\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

For example, in some cryptographic algorithms, attackers can use timing differences to infer certain properties about a private key, making the key easier to guess. Timing discrepancies effectively form a timing side channel.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-203\nCanPrecede -> CWE-385\nCanPrecede -> CWE-327\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

The CWE team is developing an alternative.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-10071:** Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies\n- **CVE-2019-10482:** Smartphone OS uses comparison functions that are not in constant time, allowing side channels\n- **CVE-2014-0984:** Password-checking function in router terminates validation of a password entry when it encounters the first incorrect character, which allows remote attackers to obtain passwords via a brute-force attack that relies on timing differences in responses to incorrect password guesses, aka a timing side-channel attack.\n\n",
