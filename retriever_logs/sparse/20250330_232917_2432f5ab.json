Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-1017:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to write 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.\n- **CVE-2021-21220:** Chain: insufficient input validation (CWE-20) in browser allows heap corruption (CWE-787), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-28664:** GPU kernel driver allows memory corruption because a user can obtain read/write access to read-only pages, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nTOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to \"Time Of Check To Time Of Use\".\nTOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-362\nChildOf -> CWE-362\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** TOCTOU issues do not always involve symlinks, and not every symlink issue is a TOCTOU problem.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Non-symlink TOCTOU issues are not reported frequently, but they are likely to occur in code that attempts to be secure.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2015-1743:** TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed\n- **CVE-2003-0813:** A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.\n- **CVE-2004-0594:** PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations for the resulting pointer.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhile a pointer can contain a reference to any arbitrary memory location, a program typically only intends to use the pointer to access limited portions of memory, such as contiguous memory used to access an individual array.\n\n\nPrograms may use offsets in order to access fields or sub-elements stored within structured data. The offset might be out-of-range if it comes from an untrusted source, is the result of an incorrect calculation, or occurs because of another error.\n\n\nIf an attacker can control or influence the offset so that it points outside of the intended boundaries of the structure, then the attacker may be able to read or write to memory locations that are used elsewhere in the product. As a result, the attack might change the state of the product as accessed through program variables, cause a crash or instable behavior, and possibly lead to code execution.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nUntrusted pointer offset: This term is narrower than the concept of \"out-of-range\" offset, since the offset might be the result of a calculation or other error that does not depend on any externally-supplied values.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-125\nCanPrecede -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.\n\n**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of \"memory corruption\" or \"memory safety.\" As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2010-2160:** Invalid offset in undocumented opcode leads to memory corruption.\n- **CVE-2010-1281:** Multimedia player uses untrusted value from a file when using file-pointer calculations.\n- **CVE-2009-3129:** Spreadsheet program processes a record with an invalid size field, which is later used as an offset.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product obtains a value from an untrusted source, converts this value to a pointer, and dereferences the resulting pointer.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAn attacker can supply a pointer for memory locations that the product is not expecting. If the pointer is dereferenced for a write operation, the attack might allow modification of critical state variables, cause a crash, or execute code. If the dereferencing operation is for a read, then the attack might allow reading of sensitive data, cause a crash, or set a variable to an unexpected value (since the value will be read from an unexpected memory location).\n\n\nThere are several variants of this weakness, including but not necessarily limited to:\n\n\n  - The untrusted value is directly invoked as a function call.\n\n  - In OS kernels or drivers where there is a boundary between \"userland\" and privileged memory spaces, an untrusted pointer might enter through an API or system call (see CWE-781 for one such example).\n\n  - Inadvertently accepting the value from an untrusted control sphere when it did not have to be accepted as input at all. This might occur when the code was originally developed to be run by a single user in a non-networked environment, and the code is then ported to or otherwise exposed to a networked environment.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-125\nCanPrecede -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

The \"handle\" in the untrusted area is replaced in one function, but not another - thus also, effectively, exposure to wrong sphere (CWE-668).\n- **CVE-2009-1719:** Untrusted dereference using undocumented constructor.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis typically occurs when the pointer or its index is incremented to a position beyond the bounds of the buffer or when pointer arithmetic results in a position outside of the valid memory location to name a few. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-125\nChildOf -> CWE-788\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** These problems may be resultant from missing sentinel values (CWE-463) or trusting a user-influenced input length variable.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-1733:** Text editor has out-of-bounds read past end of line while indenting C code\n- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: \"Heartbleed\" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.\n- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated, leading to buffer over-read or heap-based buffer overflow.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nOften, indexable resources such as memory buffers or files can be accessed using a specific position, index, or offset, such as an index for an array or a position for a file. When untrusted input is not properly validated before it is used as an index, attackers could access (or attempt to access) unauthorized portions of these resources. This could be used to cause buffer overflows, excessive resource allocation, or trigger unexpected failures. \n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-20\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2005-0369:** large ID in packet used as array index\n- **CVE-2001-1009:** negative array index as argument to POP LIST command\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nout-of-bounds array index\nindex-out-of-range\narray index underflow\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1285\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-823\nCanPrecede -> CWE-789\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness can precede uncontrolled memory allocation (CWE-789) in languages that automatically expand an array when an index is used that is larger than the size of the array, such as JavaScript.\n\n**[Theoretical]** An improperly validated array index might lead directly to the always-incorrect behavior of \"access of array using out-of-bounds index.\"\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2005-0369:** large ID in packet used as array index\n- **CVE-2001-1009:** negative array index as argument to POP LIST command\n- **CVE-2003-0721:** Integer signedness error leads to negative array index\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-415: Double Free\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a program calls free() twice with the same argument, the program's memory management data structures become corrupted. This corruption can cause the program to crash or, in some circumstances, cause two later calls to malloc() to return the same pointer. If malloc() returns the same value twice and the program later gives the attacker control over the data that is written into this doubly-allocated memory, the program becomes vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDouble-free\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-825\nChildOf -> CWE-1341\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-666\nPeerOf -> CWE-416\nPeerOf -> CWE-123\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is usually resultant from another weakness, such as an unhandled error or race condition between threads. It could also be primary to weaknesses such as buffer overflows.\n\n**[Theoretical]** It could be argued that Double Free would be most appropriately located as a child of \"Use after Free\", but \"Use\" and \"Release\" are considered to be distinct operations within vulnerability theory, therefore this is more accurately \"Release of a Resource after Expiration or Release\", which doesn't exist yet.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2006-5051:** Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\n- **CVE-2004-0642:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n- **CVE-2004-0772:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-390: Detection of Error Condition Without Action\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product detects a specific error, but takes no actions to handle the error.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-755\nCanPrecede -> CWE-401\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-21820:** A GPU data center manager detects an error due to a malformed request but does not act on it, leading to memory corruption.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not lock or does not correctly lock a resource when the product must have exclusive access to the resource.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a resource is not properly locked, an attacker could modify the resource while it is being operated on by the product. This might violate the product's assumption that the resource will not change, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-667\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-20141:** Chain: an operating system kernel has insufficent resource locking (CWE-413) leading to a use after free (CWE-416).\n\n",

This might occur when the code was originally developed to be run by a single user in a non-networked environment, and the code is then ported to or otherwise exposed to a networked environment.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-125\nCanPrecede -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.\n\n**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of \"memory corruption\" or \"memory safety.\" As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2007-5655:** message-passing framework interprets values in packets as pointers, causing a crash.\n- **CVE-2010-2299:** labeled as a \"type confusion\" issue, also referred to as a \"stale pointer.\" However, the bug ID says \"contents are simply interpreted as a pointer... renderer ordinarily doesn't supply this pointer directly\". The \"handle\" in the untrusted area is replaced in one function, but not another - thus also, effectively, exposure to wrong sphere (CWE-668).\n- **CVE-2009-1719:** Untrusted dereference using undocumented constructor.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis typically occurs when the pointer or its index is incremented to a position beyond the bounds of the buffer or when pointer arithmetic results in a position outside of the valid memory location to name a few. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-125\nChildOf -> CWE-788\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** These problems may be resultant from missing sentinel values (CWE-463) or trusting a user-influenced input length variable.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-1733:** Text editor has out-of-bounds read past end of line while indenting C code\n- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: \"Heartbleed\" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.\n- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated, leading to buffer over-read or heap-based buffer overflow.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nOften, indexable resources such as memory buffers or files can be accessed using a specific position, index, or offset, such as an index for an array or a position for a file. When untrusted input is not properly validated before it is used as an index, attackers could access (or attempt to access) unauthorized portions of these resources. This could be used to cause buffer overflows, excessive resource allocation, or trigger unexpected failures. \n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-20\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2005-0369:** large ID in packet used as array index\n- **CVE-2001-1009:** negative array index as argument to POP LIST command\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nout-of-bounds array index\nindex-out-of-range\narray index underflow\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1285\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-823\nCanPrecede -> CWE-789\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness can precede uncontrolled memory allocation (CWE-789) in languages that automatically expand an array when an index is used that is larger than the size of the array, such as JavaScript.\n\n**[Theoretical]** An improperly validated array index might lead directly to the always-incorrect behavior of \"access of array using out-of-bounds index.\"\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2005-0369:** large ID in packet used as array index\n- **CVE-2001-1009:** negative array index as argument to POP LIST command\n- **CVE-2003-0721:** Integer signedness error leads to negative array index\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-415: Double Free\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a program calls free() twice with the same argument, the program's memory management data structures become corrupted. This corruption can cause the program to crash or, in some circumstances, cause two later calls to malloc() to return the same pointer. If malloc() returns the same value twice and the program later gives the attacker control over the data that is written into this doubly-allocated memory, the program becomes vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDouble-free\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-825\nChildOf -> CWE-1341\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-666\nPeerOf -> CWE-416\nPeerOf -> CWE-123\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is usually resultant from another weakness, such as an unhandled error or race condition between threads. It could also be primary to weaknesses such as buffer overflows.\n\n**[Theoretical]** It could be argued that Double Free would be most appropriately located as a child of \"Use after Free\", but \"Use\" and \"Release\" are considered to be distinct operations within vulnerability theory, therefore this is more accurately \"Release of a Resource after Expiration or Release\", which doesn't exist yet.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2006-5051:** Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\n- **CVE-2004-0642:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n- **CVE-2004-0772:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-390: Detection of Error Condition Without Action\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product detects a specific error, but takes no actions to handle the error.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-755\nCanPrecede -> CWE-401\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This might violate the product's assumption that the resource will not change, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-667\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
