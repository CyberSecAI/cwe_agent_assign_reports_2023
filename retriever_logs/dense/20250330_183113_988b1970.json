The vulnerability occurs within the `utf_ptr2char()` function located in `mbyte.c`.\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is an improper bounds check within the `utf_ptr2char()` function when handling UTF-8 characters. The function reads a sequence of bytes assuming that it will always be a valid character, however, it doesn't check if the sequence of bytes goes beyond the end of the buffer, therefore a read-out-of-bounds can occur.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Buffer Over-read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read. This occurs when the `utf_ptr2char()` function reads beyond the allocated memory buffer while processing UTF-8 characters in a specific way, for example with a sequence that is incomplete/invalid.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could cause a crash or denial of service when Vim attempts to process a specially crafted, malformed, UTF-8 input. This is explicitly noted by Gentoo's GLSA which mentions that the \"worst of which could result in denial of service.\"\n- **Information Leak (Potential):** Although not explicitly stated in all sources, a buffer over-read can potentially expose information from adjacent memory locations. This is not specifically confirmed for this CVE in the provided content.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Maliciously Crafted File:** An attacker could craft a text file with specific UTF-8 encoded sequences that trigger the vulnerability. When a user opens the crafted file with Vim, the `utf_ptr2char()` function is invoked with the malicious input, causing the over-read condition.\n- **Malicious Input to Vim:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing malformed UTF-8 input via various methods of Vim such as pasting into the editor, or processing input from other external sources like macros or commands.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Ability to Provide Input:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed UTF-8 input to Vim. This could be done through a malicious file or by other means of input within the Vim environment.\n- **No special privileges:** The vulnerability doesn't seem to require special privileges for exploitation, so any user able to edit files with Vim could potentially be vulnerable.\n\n**Additional Information from Sources**\n\n*   **GitHub Commit:** The commit message indicates that the issue was found in the context of a cursor position being invalid after using a \"0;\" range. This suggests that the vulnerability can be triggered in combination with range operations, where incorrect cursor positions were being handled. The fix implemented a check to prevent the out-of-bounds read in such circumstances.\n*   **Apple:** Apple's security advisory lists this vulnerability as addressed in macOS Ventura 13, alongside a large number of other Vim vulnerabilities, indicating that a patch is necessary for users of the affected Vim version on macOS.\n*   **Gentoo:** Gentoo's advisory classifies the vulnerability as \"low\" severity with \"remote\" exploitability (although this may vary depending on how one defines \"remote\"). They note that an update to a patched version of Vim is necessary to resolve the issue.\n*   **Fedora:** Fedora\u2019s update notifications also highlight this vulnerability as resolved with an update to their `vim` package.\n*   **Affected versions:** The Gentoo advisories specify that versions of vim and gvim before 9.0.0060 and 9.0.1157 are vulnerable.\n\nIn summary, CVE-2022-1927 is a buffer over-read vulnerability in Vim that can lead to denial of service and, potentially, information disclosure. The vulnerability is triggered by malformed UTF-8 input, and it was patched in subsequent versions of Vim.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 126 | Buffer Over-read | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.165 |\n| 2 | 786 | Access of Memory Location Before Start of Buffer | Base | Discouraged | sparse | 0.122 |\n| 3 | 124 | Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.119 |\n| 4 | 1222 | Insufficient Granularity of Address Regions Protected by Register Locks | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.112 |\n| 5 | 122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.111 |\n| 6 | 127 | Buffer Under-read | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.536 |\n| 7 | 120 | Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') | Base | Allowed-with-Review | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.096 |\n| 9 | 805 | Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.090 |\n| 10 | 130 | Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.086 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis typically occurs when the pointer or its index is incremented to a position beyond the bounds of the buffer or when pointer arithmetic results in a position outside of the valid memory location to name a few.

It also overlaps existing CWE entries and might be deprecated in the future.\n**Comments:** If the \"Access\" operation is known to be a read or a write, then investigate children of entries such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write and CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read.\n**Reasons:**\n- Potential Deprecation\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-2227:** Unchecked length of SSLv2 challenge value leads to buffer underflow.\n- **CVE-2007-4580:** Buffer underflow from a small size value with a large buffer (length parameter inconsistency, CWE-130)\n- **CVE-2007-1584:** Buffer underflow from an all-whitespace string, which causes a counter to be decremented before the buffer while looking for a non-whitespace character.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis typically occurs when a pointer or its index is decremented to a position before the buffer, when pointer arithmetic results in a position before the beginning of the valid memory location, or when a negative index is used.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nbuffer underrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term \"buffer underrun\". \"Buffer underflow\" is more commonly used, although both terms are also sometimes used to describe a buffer under-read (CWE-127).\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-786\nChildOf -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This could be resultant from several errors, including a bad offset or an array index that decrements before the beginning of the buffer (see CWE-129).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-24018:** buffer underwrite in firmware verification routine allows code execution via a crafted firmware image\n- **CVE-2002-2227:** Unchecked length of SSLv2 challenge value leads to buffer underflow.\n- **CVE-2007-4580:** Buffer underflow from a small size value with a large buffer (length parameter inconsistency, CWE-130)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1222: Insufficient Granularity of Address Regions Protected by Register Locks\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product defines a large address region protected from modification by the same register lock control bit. This results in a conflict between the functional requirement that some addresses need to be writable by software during operation and the security requirement that the system configuration lock bit must be set during the boot process.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nIntegrated circuits and hardware IPs can expose the device configuration controls that need to be programmed after device power reset by a trusted firmware or software module (commonly set by BIOS/bootloader) and then locked from any further modification. In hardware design, this is commonly implemented using a programmable lock bit which enables/disables writing to a protected set of registers or address regions. When the programmable lock bit is set, the relevant address region can be implemented as a hardcoded value in hardware logic that cannot be changed later.\n\n\nA problem can arise wherein the protected region definition is not granular enough. After the programmable lock bit has been set, then this new functionality cannot be implemented without change to the hardware design.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1220\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-788\nChildOf -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Heap-based buffer overflows are usually just as dangerous as stack-based buffer overflows.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2007-4268:** Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-127: Buffer Under-read\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations prior to the targeted buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis typically occurs when the pointer or its index is decremented to a position before the buffer, when pointer arithmetic results in a position before the beginning of the valid memory location, or when a negative index is used. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-125\nChildOf -> CWE-786\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Research Gap]** Under-studied.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-40985:** HTML conversion package has a buffer under-read, allowing a crash\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.\n\n### Extended Description\nA buffer overflow condition exists when a product attempts to put more data in a buffer than it can hold, or when it attempts to put data in a memory area outside of the boundaries of a buffer. The simplest type of error, and the most common cause of buffer overflows, is the \"classic\" case in which the product copies the buffer without restricting how much is copied. Other variants exist, but the existence of a classic overflow strongly suggests that the programmer is not considering even the most basic of security protections.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nClassic Buffer Overflow: This term was frequently used by vulnerability researchers during approximately 1995 to 2005 to differentiate buffer copies without length checks (which had been known about for decades) from other emerging weaknesses that still involved invalid accesses of buffers, as vulnerability researchers began to develop advanced exploitation techniques.\nUnbounded Transfer\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-123\nChildOf -> CWE-20\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** There are some indications that this CWE ID might be misused and selected simply because it mentions \"buffer overflow\" - an increasingly vague term. This CWE entry is only appropriate for \"Buffer Copy\" operations (not buffer reads), in which where there is no \"Checking [the] Size of Input\", and (by implication of the copy) writing past the end of the buffer.\n**Comments:** If the vulnerability being analyzed involves out-of-bounds reads, then consider CWE-125 or descendants. For root cause analysis: if there is any input validation, consider children of CWE-20 such as CWE-1284. If there is a calculation error for buffer sizes, consider CWE-131 or similar.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** At the code level, stack-based and heap-based overflows do not differ significantly, so there usually is not a need to distinguish them. From the attacker perspective, they can be quite different, since different techniques are required to exploit them.\n\n**[Terminology]** Many issues that are now called \"buffer overflows\" are substantively different than the \"classic\" overflow, including entirely different bug types that rely on overflow exploit techniques, such as integer signedness errors, integer overflows, and format string bugs. This imprecise terminology can make it difficult to determine which variant is being reported.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2000-1094:** buffer overflow using command with long argument\n- **CVE-1999-0046:** buffer overflow in local program using long environment variable\n- **CVE-2002-1337:** buffer overflow in comment characters, when product increments a counter for a \">\" but does not decrement for \"<\"\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nSpecified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-789\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2008-1440:** lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop\n- **CVE-2008-2374:** lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen the length value exceeds the size of the destination, a buffer overflow could occur.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2011-1959:** Chain: large length value causes buffer over-read (CWE-126)\n- **CVE-2011-1848:** Use of packet length field to make a calculation, then copy into a fixed-size buffer\n- **CVE-2011-0105:** Chain: retrieval of length value from an uninitialized memory location\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.\n\n### Extended Description\nIf an attacker can manipulate the length parameter associated with an input such that it is inconsistent with the actual length of the input, this can be leveraged to cause the target application to behave in unexpected, and possibly, malicious ways. One of the possible motives for doing so is to pass in arbitrarily large input to the application. Another possible motivation is the modification of application state by including invalid data for subsequent properties of the application. Such weaknesses commonly lead to attacks such as buffer overflows and execution of arbitrary code.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nlength manipulation\nlength tampering\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-240\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-805\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This probably overlaps other categories including zero-length issues.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: \"Heartbleed\" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.\n- **CVE-2009-2299:** Web application firewall consumes excessive memory when an HTTP request contains a large Content-Length value but no POST data.\n- **CVE-2001-0825:** Buffer overflow in internal string handling routine allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a length argument of zero or less, which disables the length check.\n\n",

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** These problems may be resultant from missing sentinel values (CWE-463) or trusting a user-influenced input length variable.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-1733:** Text editor has out-of-bounds read past end of line while indenting C code\n- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: \"Heartbleed\" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.\n- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated, leading to buffer over-read or heap-based buffer overflow.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-786: Access of Memory Location Before Start of Buffer\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis typically occurs when a pointer or its index is decremented to a position before the buffer, when pointer arithmetic results in a position before the beginning of the valid memory location, or when a negative index is used.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available. It also overlaps existing CWE entries and might be deprecated in the future.\n**Comments:** If the \"Access\" operation is known to be a read or a write, then investigate children of entries such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write and CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read.\n**Reasons:**\n- Potential Deprecation\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-2227:** Unchecked length of SSLv2 challenge value leads to buffer underflow.\n- **CVE-2007-4580:** Buffer underflow from a small size value with a large buffer (length parameter inconsistency, CWE-130)\n- **CVE-2007-1584:** Buffer underflow from an all-whitespace string, which causes a counter to be decremented before the buffer while looking for a non-whitespace character.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis typically occurs when a pointer or its index is decremented to a position before the buffer, when pointer arithmetic results in a position before the beginning of the valid memory location, or when a negative index is used.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nbuffer underrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term \"buffer underrun\". \"Buffer underflow\" is more commonly used, although both terms are also sometimes used to describe a buffer under-read (CWE-127).\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-786\nChildOf -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This could be resultant from several errors, including a bad offset or an array index that decrements before the beginning of the buffer (see CWE-129).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-24018:** buffer underwrite in firmware verification routine allows code execution via a crafted firmware image\n- **CVE-2002-2227:** Unchecked length of SSLv2 challenge value leads to buffer underflow.\n- **CVE-2007-4580:** Buffer underflow from a small size value with a large buffer (length parameter inconsistency, CWE-130)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1222: Insufficient Granularity of Address Regions Protected by Register Locks\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product defines a large address region protected from modification by the same register lock control bit. This results in a conflict between the functional requirement that some addresses need to be writable by software during operation and the security requirement that the system configuration lock bit must be set during the boot process.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nIntegrated circuits and hardware IPs can expose the device configuration controls that need to be programmed after device power reset by a trusted firmware or software module (commonly set by BIOS/bootloader) and then locked from any further modification. In hardware design, this is commonly implemented using a programmable lock bit which enables/disables writing to a protected set of registers or address regions. When the programmable lock bit is set, the relevant address region can be implemented as a hardcoded value in hardware logic that cannot be changed later.\n\n\nA problem can arise wherein the protected region definition is not granular enough. After the programmable lock bit has been set, then this new functionality cannot be implemented without change to the hardware design.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1220\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-788\nChildOf -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Heap-based buffer overflows are usually just as dangerous as stack-based buffer overflows.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2007-4268:** Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-127: Buffer Under-read\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations prior to the targeted buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis typically occurs when the pointer or its index is decremented to a position before the buffer, when pointer arithmetic results in a position before the beginning of the valid memory location, or when a negative index is used.

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Research Gap]** Under-studied.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-40985:** HTML conversion package has a buffer under-read, allowing a crash\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.\n\n### Extended Description\nA buffer overflow condition exists when a product attempts to put more data in a buffer than it can hold, or when it attempts to put data in a memory area outside of the boundaries of a buffer. The simplest type of error, and the most common cause of buffer overflows, is the \"classic\" case in which the product copies the buffer without restricting how much is copied. Other variants exist, but the existence of a classic overflow strongly suggests that the programmer is not considering even the most basic of security protections.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nClassic Buffer Overflow: This term was frequently used by vulnerability researchers during approximately 1995 to 2005 to differentiate buffer copies without length checks (which had been known about for decades) from other emerging weaknesses that still involved invalid accesses of buffers, as vulnerability researchers began to develop advanced exploitation techniques.\nUnbounded Transfer\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-123\nChildOf -> CWE-20\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** There are some indications that this CWE ID might be misused and selected simply because it mentions \"buffer overflow\" - an increasingly vague term. This CWE entry is only appropriate for \"Buffer Copy\" operations (not buffer reads), in which where there is no \"Checking [the] Size of Input\", and (by implication of the copy) writing past the end of the buffer.\n**Comments:** If the vulnerability being analyzed involves out-of-bounds reads, then consider CWE-125 or descendants. For root cause analysis: if there is any input validation, consider children of CWE-20 such as CWE-1284. If there is a calculation error for buffer sizes, consider CWE-131 or similar.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** At the code level, stack-based and heap-based overflows do not differ significantly, so there usually is not a need to distinguish them. From the attacker perspective, they can be quite different, since different techniques are required to exploit them.\n\n**[Terminology]** Many issues that are now called \"buffer overflows\" are substantively different than the \"classic\" overflow, including entirely different bug types that rely on overflow exploit techniques, such as integer signedness errors, integer overflows, and format string bugs. This imprecise terminology can make it difficult to determine which variant is being reported.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2000-1094:** buffer overflow using command with long argument\n- **CVE-1999-0046:** buffer overflow in local program using long environment variable\n- **CVE-2002-1337:** buffer overflow in comment characters, when product increments a counter for a \">\" but does not decrement for \"<\"\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nSpecified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-789\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2008-1440:** lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop\n- **CVE-2008-2374:** lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen the length value exceeds the size of the destination, a buffer overflow could occur.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

One of the possible motives for doing so is to pass in arbitrarily large input to the application. Another possible motivation is the modification of application state by including invalid data for subsequent properties of the application. Such weaknesses commonly lead to attacks such as buffer overflows and execution of arbitrary code.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nlength manipulation\nlength tampering\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-240\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-805\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This probably overlaps other categories including zero-length issues.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: \"Heartbleed\" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.\n- **CVE-2009-2299:** Web application firewall consumes excessive memory when an HTTP request contains a large Content-Length value but no POST data.\n- **CVE-2001-0825:** Buffer overflow in internal string handling routine allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a length argument of zero or less, which disables the length check.\n\n"
