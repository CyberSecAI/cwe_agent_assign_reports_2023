If `tf.raw_ops.TensorListConcat` is given `element_shape=[]`, it results segmentation fault which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit fc33f3dc4c14051a83eec6535b608abe1d355fde. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **impact:** segmentation fault\n- **vector:** giving element_shape=[]\n- **product:** TensorFlow\n- **version:** before patch\n- **component:** tf.raw_ops.TensorListConcat\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-41891:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability lies in the `tf.raw_ops.TensorListConcat` operation within TensorFlow. It occurs when the `element_shape` argument is provided as an empty list (`[]`).\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- The code lacks proper validation for the `element_shape` input. Specifically, it doesn't check for an empty shape before proceeding with operations, resulting in a segmentation fault.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- A successful exploit leads to a segmentation fault, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This can crash the TensorFlow process.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The attack vector involves crafting a TensorFlow program that calls `tf.raw_ops.TensorListConcat` with an empty `element_shape`.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- An attacker needs the ability to execute TensorFlow code, either locally or remotely, to trigger the vulnerability.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\n- The vulnerability is located in the `tensorflow/core/kernels/list_kernels.h` file, specifically within the `TensorListConcat` class's `Compute` method.\n- The fix implemented in commit `fc33f3dc4c14051a83eec6535b608abe1d355fde` addresses this by adding a check to ensure `element_shape` is not empty.\n- The fix also includes added unit tests `tensorflow/python/kernel_tests/data_structures/list_ops_test.py` to cover this scenario.\n\nThe provided information is more detailed than the standard CVE description, providing the exact code location, attack vector, and the fix.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 824 | Access of Uninitialized Pointer | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.231 |\n| 2 | 681 | Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.211 |\n| 3 | 1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.210 |\n| 4 | 617 | Reachable Assertion | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.200 |\n| 5 | 122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.189 |\n| 6 | 1287 | Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.456 |\n| 7 | 787 | Out-of-bounds Write | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 663 | Use of a Non-reentrant Function in a Concurrent Context | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.184 |\n| 9 | 125 | Out-of-bounds Read | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.183 |\n| 10 | 674 | Uncontrolled Recursion | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.181 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nIf the pointer contains an uninitialized value, then the value might not point to a valid memory location. This could cause the product to read from or write to unexpected memory locations, leading to a denial of service.
