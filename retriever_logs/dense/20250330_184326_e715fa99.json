The regular expression used in the undocumented `get_file_transfer_type` method is inefficient and can cause excessive CPU consumption when processing specially crafted inputs.\n- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service. By providing specially crafted input to the vulnerable method, an attacker can cause the server to become unresponsive due to high CPU usage.\n- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is via supplying arbitrary input to the undocumented `get_file_transfer_type` method.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to supply input to the `get_file_transfer_type` method which is an undocumented function, which implies some access to the application code that uses the library.\n\nThe provided content gives more details than the CVE description, specifically detailing the vulnerable function, the nature of the vulnerability, and providing a PoC.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 1333 | Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity | Base | Allowed | alternate_terms | 1.000 |\n| 2 | 617 | Reachable Assertion | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.217 |\n| 3 | 158 | Improper Neutralization of Null Byte or NUL Character | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.200 |\n| 4 | 674 | Uncontrolled Recursion | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.198 |\n| 5 | 407 | Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.197 |\n| 6 | 185 | Incorrect Regular Expression | Class | Allowed-with-Review | dense | 0.464 |\n| 7 | 182 | Collapse of Data into Unsafe Value | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 777 | Regular Expression without Anchors | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.195 |\n| 9 | 94 | Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') | Base | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.194 |\n| 10 | 626 | Null Byte Interaction Error (Poison Null Byte) | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.191 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.\n\n### Extended Description\nSome regular expression engines have a feature called \"backtracking\". If the token cannot match, the engine \"backtracks\" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.\n Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:\n\n\n  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.\n\n  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.\n\n  - The input can be long enough.\n\n Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. \n\n### Alternative Terms\nReDoS: ReDoS is an abbreviation of \"Regular expression Denial of Service\".\nRegular Expression Denial of Service: While this term is attack-focused, this is commonly used to describe the weakness.\nCatastrophic backtracking: This term is used to describe the behavior of the regular expression as a negative technical impact.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-407\nChildOf -> CWE-407\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-5243:** server allows ReDOS with crafted User-Agent strings, due to overlapping capture groups that cause excessive backtracking.\n- **CVE-2021-21317:** npm package for user-agent parser prone to ReDoS due to overlapping capture groups\n- **CVE-2019-16215:** Markdown parser uses inefficient regex when processing a message, allowing users to cause CPU consumption and delay preventing processing of other messages.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhile assertion is good for catching logic errors and reducing the chances of reaching more serious vulnerability conditions, it can still lead to a denial of service.\n\n\nFor example, if a server handles multiple simultaneous connections, and an assert() occurs in one single connection that causes all other connections to be dropped, this is a reachable assertion that leads to a denial of service.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nassertion failure\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-670\nChildOf -> CWE-670\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-49286:** Chain: function in web caching proxy does not correctly check a return value (CWE-253) leading to a reachable assertion (CWE-617)\n- **CVE-2006-6767:** FTP server allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon abort) via crafted commands which trigger an assertion failure.\n- **CVE-2006-6811:** Chat client allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a long message string when connecting to a server, which causes an assertion failure.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-158: Improper Neutralization of Null Byte or NUL Character\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes NUL characters or null bytes when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\nAs data is parsed, an injected NUL character or null byte may cause the product to believe the input is terminated earlier than it actually is, or otherwise cause the input to be misinterpreted. This could then be used to inject potentially dangerous input that occurs after the null byte or otherwise bypass validation routines and other protection mechanisms.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-138\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This can be a factor in multiple interpretation errors, other interaction errors, filename equivalence, etc.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2008-1284:** NUL byte in theme name causes directory traversal impact to be worse\n- **CVE-2005-2008:** Source code disclosure using trailing null.\n- **CVE-2005-3293:** Source code disclosure using trailing null.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nStack Exhaustion\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-834\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2007-1285:** Deeply nested arrays trigger stack exhaustion.\n- **CVE-2007-3409:** Self-referencing pointers create infinite loop and resultant stack exhaustion.\n- **CVE-2016-10707:** Javascript application accidentally changes input in a way that prevents a recursive call from detecting an exit condition.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nQuadratic Complexity: Used when the algorithmic complexity is related to the square of the number of inputs (N^2)\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-405\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-32617:** C++ library for image metadata has \"quadratic complexity\" issue with unnecessarily repetitive parsing each time an invalid character is encountered\n- **CVE-2020-10735:** Python has \"quadratic complexity\" issue when converting string to int with many digits in unexpected bases\n- **CVE-2020-5243:** server allows ReDOS with crafted User-Agent strings, due to overlapping capture groups that cause excessive backtracking.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-185: Incorrect Regular Expression\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product specifies a regular expression in a way that causes data to be improperly matched or compared.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen the regular expression is used in protection mechanisms such as filtering or validation, this may allow an attacker to bypass the intended restrictions on the incoming data.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-697\nCanPrecede -> CWE-187\nCanPrecede -> CWE-182\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** While there is some overlap with allowlist/denylist problems, this entry is intended to deal with incorrectly written regular expressions, regardless of their intended use. Not every regular expression is intended for use as an allowlist or denylist. In addition, allowlists and denylists can be implemented using other mechanisms besides regular expressions.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Regexp errors are likely a primary factor in many MFVs, especially those that require multiple manipulations to exploit. However, they are rarely diagnosed at this level of detail.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-2109:** Regexp isn't \"anchored\" to the beginning or end, which allows spoofed values that have trusted values as substrings.\n- **CVE-2005-1949:** Regexp for IP address isn't anchored at the end, allowing appending of shell metacharacters.\n- **CVE-2001-1072:** Bypass access restrictions via multiple leading slash, which causes a regular expression to fail.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-182: Collapse of Data into Unsafe Value\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product filters data in a way that causes it to be reduced or \"collapsed\" into an unsafe value that violates an expected security property.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-693\nCanPrecede -> CWE-33\nCanPrecede -> CWE-34\nCanPrecede -> CWE-35\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Overlaps regular expressions, although an implementation might not necessarily use regexp's.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2004-0815:** \"/.////\" in pathname collapses to absolute path.\n- **CVE-2005-3123:** \"/.//..//////././\" is collapsed into \"/.././\" after \"..\" and \"//\" sequences are removed.\n- **CVE-2002-0325:** \".../...//\" collapsed to \"...\" due to removal of \"./\" in web server.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-777: Regular Expression without Anchors\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a regular expression to perform neutralization, but the regular expression is not anchored and may allow malicious or malformed data to slip through.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen performing tasks such as validating against a set of allowed inputs (allowlist), data is examined and possibly modified to ensure that it is well-formed and adheres to a list of safe values. If the regular expression is not anchored, malicious or malformed data may be included before or after any string matching the regular expression. The type of malicious data that is allowed will depend on the context of the application and which anchors are omitted from the regular expression.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-625\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen a product allows a user's input to contain code syntax, it might be possible for an attacker to craft the code in such a way that it will alter the intended control flow of the product. Such an alteration could lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nInjection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-913\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This entry is frequently misused for vulnerabilities with a technical impact of \"code execution,\" which does not by itself indicate a root cause weakness, since dozens of weaknesses can enable code execution.\n**Comments:** This weakness only applies when the product's functionality intentionally constructs all or part of a code segment. It could be that executing code could be the result of other weaknesses that do not involve the construction of code segments.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n- Frequent Misinterpretation\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-29374:** Math component in an LLM framework translates user input into a Python expression that is input into the Python exec() method, allowing code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n- **CVE-2024-5565:** Python-based library uses an LLM prompt containing user input to dynamically generate code that is then fed as input into the Python exec() method, allowing code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n- **CVE-2024-4181:** Framework for LLM applications allows eval injection via a crafted response from a hosting provider.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-626: Null Byte Interaction Error (Poison Null Byte)\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly handle null bytes or NUL characters when passing data between different representations or components.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nA null byte (NUL character) can have different meanings across representations or languages. For example, it is a string terminator in standard C libraries, but Perl and PHP strings do not treat it as a terminator. When two representations are crossed - such as when Perl or PHP invokes underlying C functionality - this can produce an interaction error with unexpected results. Similar issues have been reported for ASP. Other interpreters written in C might also be affected.\n\n\nThe poison null byte is frequently useful in path traversal attacks by terminating hard-coded extensions that are added to a filename. It can play a role in regular expression processing in PHP.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-147\nChildOf -> CWE-436\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** Current usage of \"poison null byte\" is typically related to this C/Perl/PHP interaction error, but the original term in 1998 was applied to an off-by-one buffer overflow involving a null byte.\n\n**[Research Gap]** There are not many CVE examples, because the poison NULL byte is a design limitation, which typically is not included in CVE by itself. It is typically used as a facilitator manipulation to widen the scope of potential attacks against other vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2005-4155:** NUL byte bypasses PHP regular expression check\n- **CVE-2005-3153:** inserting SQL after a NUL byte bypasses allowlist regexp, enabling SQL injection\n\n",
