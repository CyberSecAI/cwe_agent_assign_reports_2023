(WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS is only intended for debugging.)\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **weakness:** **buffer over-read**\n- **vector:** malicious TLS 1.3 client or network attacker\n- **product:** wolfSSL\n- **version:** before 5.5.2\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-42905:\n\n**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**\n\n   - The provided text from multiple sources (seclists.org, blog.trailofbits.com, github.com and wolfssl.com) directly references CVE-2022-42905 and provides details about the vulnerability. This confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.\n\n**2. Vulnerability Details:**\n\n   - **Root Cause:** A heap-buffer over-read vulnerability exists within the `AddPacketInfo` function in wolfSSL when the `WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS` flag is enabled. This is due to incorrect pointer arithmetic when constructing the input buffer for the `AddPacketInfo` function.\n\n   - **Weakness:** The vulnerability lies in the `tls13.c:DoTls13HandShakeMsgType` function where it calculates the starting address of the input buffer incorrectly, causing it to read data before the intended beginning of the buffer. This out-of-bounds read is then copied into a buffer that is exposed via the wolfSSL API through functions like `wolfSSL_connect_ex` and `wolfSSL_accept_ex`.\n      - Specifically, when `WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS` is defined, the code calculates the data pointer as `input + *inOutIdx - add` where `add = RECORD_HEADER_SZ + HANDSHAKE_HEADER_SZ` (which equals 9). However, `*inOutIdx` is only 4 at this point, making `data = input - 5`.\n   - **Impact:**\n      - **Heap Over-read:** A malicious attacker can cause a heap buffer over-read of at least 5 bytes (client) or 15 bytes(server).\n      - **Information Disclosure:** This over-read can expose sensitive heap data to the callback function, which can then be exfiltrated through logging mechanisms or other means.\n      - **Potential Exploitation:** While a systematic exploit is not identified, the vulnerability can be triggered at will by a malicious client or server. This can be further exploited to potentially exfiltrate sensitive data by manipulating timing and logging configurations.\n   - **Attack Vectors:**\n      - **Malicious Client:** A malicious client can send a crafted Client Hello message to a server to trigger the heap over-read on the server.\n      - **Malicious Server:** A malicious server can send a Hello Retry Request message to a client to trigger the heap over-read on the client.\n      - **Network Attacker:** A network attacker can also intercept and inject malformed messages to trigger the vulnerability.\n   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n      - The attacker needs to be able to send crafted network messages to a wolfSSL server or client.\n      - To exploit the information disclosure aspect, the attacker needs some level of access to the output/logging of the vulnerable application utilizing the affected callbacks.\n      - The attacker must also target deployments that enable the `WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS` macro, which is intended for debugging and not production use.\n\n**3. Technical Details:**\n\n   - **Affected Code Location:**\n        - `tls13.c:DoTls13HandShakeMsgType` (specifically line 10094 in the referenced git hash)\n        - `internal.c:AddPacketInfo` (specifically line 25169)\n   - **Incorrect Calculation:** The code incorrectly calculates the pointer to the input buffer to be processed by `AddPacketInfo`. The offset calculation assumes a record header has been parsed when it has not, leading to a negative offset.\n   - **Data Exposure:** The over-read buffer, which may contain sensitive data, is made available through the `ssl->timeoutInfo->packets` structure, which is exposed to user through the `wolfSSL_connect_ex` and `wolfSSL_accept_ex` functions if a callback is registered for timeouts\n   - **Vulnerable Versions:** wolfSSL versions before 5.5.2 are affected.\n\n**4. Remediation:**\n   - The use of `WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS` in production is strongly discouraged.\n   - The flawed logic in `tls13.c:DoTls13HandShakeMsgType` needs to be corrected to account for the absence of a record layer header when calculating the input buffer pointer.\n\n**5. Additional Notes:**\n   - The vulnerability was discovered using the `tlspuffin` fuzzer.\n   - The fix was implemented quickly by the wolfSSL team.\n   - While a systematic exploit for RCE is not mentioned, the information disclosure vulnerability is of significant concern in sensitive deployments using callbacks for logging or other similar functions.\n\nIn summary, CVE-2022-42905 is a heap-buffer over-read vulnerability in wolfSSL caused by incorrect pointer arithmetic when using the `WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS` macro. It can be triggered by malicious network traffic and could expose sensitive information through logging mechanisms.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 126 | Buffer Over-read | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.317 |\n| 2 | 125 | Out-of-bounds Read | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.251 |\n| 3 | 1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.241 |\n| 4 | 295 | Improper Certificate Validation | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.239 |\n| 5 | 122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.238 |\n| 6 | 124 | Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow') | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.566 |\n| 7 | 193 | Off-by-one Error | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.238 |\n| 9 | 319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.232 |\n| 10 | 909 | Missing Initialization of Resource | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.230 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis typically occurs when the pointer or its index is incremented to a position beyond the bounds of the buffer or when pointer arithmetic results in a position outside of the valid memory location to name a few.

This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may\n         become a very small or negative number.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOverflow: The terms \"overflow\" and \"wraparound\" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.\nWraparound: The terms \"overflow\" and \"wraparound\" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.\nwrap, wrap-around, wrap around: Alternate spellings of \"wraparound\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with \"overflow,\" \"underflow,\" and \"wraparound\" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called \"underflows\").\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\n\"Integer overflow\" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.\n\n\nA \"wraparound\" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.\n\n\n\"Overflow\" is sometimes conflated with \"wraparound\" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.\n\n\nThe \"overflow\" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use \"overflow\" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using \"underflow\" for exceeding the minimum.\n\n\nSome people use \"overflow\" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses \"underflow\" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.\n\n\nSee [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.\n\n\n**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany communication channels can be \"sniffed\" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.\n\n\nApplicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.\n\n\nWhen full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to \"sniff\" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information. \n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-311\nChildOf -> CWE-311\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29519:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends sensitive information in plaintext, including passwords and session tokens.\n- **CVE-2022-30312:** Building Controller uses a protocol that transmits authentication credentials in plaintext.\n- **CVE-2022-31204:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends password in plaintext.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not initialize a critical resource.\n\n### Extended Description\nMany resources require initialization before they can be properly used.

    "base_query": "## Vulnerability Description\nIn wolfSSL before 5.5.2, if callback functions are enabled (via the WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS flag), then a malicious TLS 1.3 client or network attacker can trigger a **buffer over-read** on the heap of 5 bytes. (WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS is only intended for debugging.)\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **weakness:** **buffer over-read**\n- **vector:** malicious TLS 1.3 client or network attacker\n- **product:** wolfSSL\n- **version:** before 5.5.2\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-42905:\n\n**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**\n\n   - The provided text from multiple sources (seclists.org, blog.trailofbits.com, github.com and wolfssl.com) directly references CVE-2022-42905 and provides details about the vulnerability. This confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.\n\n**2. Vulnerability Details:**\n\n   - **Root Cause:** A heap-buffer over-read vulnerability exists within the `AddPacketInfo` function in wolfSSL when the `WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS` flag is enabled. This is due to incorrect pointer arithmetic when constructing the input buffer for the `AddPacketInfo` function.\n\n   - **Weakness:** The vulnerability lies in the `tls13.c:DoTls13HandShakeMsgType` function where it calculates the starting address of the input buffer incorrectly, causing it to read data before the intended beginning of the buffer. This out-of-bounds read is then copied into a buffer that is exposed via the wolfSSL API through functions like `wolfSSL_connect_ex` and `wolfSSL_accept_ex`.\n      - Specifically, when `WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS` is defined, the code calculates the data pointer as `input + *inOutIdx - add` where `add = RECORD_HEADER_SZ + HANDSHAKE_HEADER_SZ` (which equals 9). However, `*inOutIdx` is only 4 at this point, making `data = input - 5`.\n   - **Impact:**\n      - **Heap Over-read:** A malicious attacker can cause a heap buffer over-read of at least 5 bytes (client) or 15 bytes(server).\n      - **Information Disclosure:** This over-read can expose sensitive heap data to the callback function, which can then be exfiltrated through logging mechanisms or other means.\n      - **Potential Exploitation:** While a systematic exploit is not identified, the vulnerability can be triggered at will by a malicious client or server. This can be further exploited to potentially exfiltrate sensitive data by manipulating timing and logging configurations.\n   - **Attack Vectors:**\n      - **Malicious Client:** A malicious client can send a crafted Client Hello message to a server to trigger the heap over-read on the server.\n      - **Malicious Server:** A malicious server can send a Hello Retry Request message to a client to trigger the heap over-read on the client.\n      - **Network Attacker:** A network attacker can also intercept and inject malformed messages to trigger the vulnerability.\n   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n      - The attacker needs to be able to send crafted network messages to a wolfSSL server or client.\n      - To exploit the information disclosure aspect, the attacker needs some level of access to the output/logging of the vulnerable application utilizing the affected callbacks.\n      - The attacker must also target deployments that enable the `WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS` macro, which is intended for debugging and not production use.\n\n**3. Technical Details:**\n\n   - **Affected Code Location:**\n        - `tls13.c:DoTls13HandShakeMsgType` (specifically line 10094 in the referenced git hash)\n        - `internal.c:AddPacketInfo` (specifically line 25169)\n   - **Incorrect Calculation:** The code incorrectly calculates the pointer to the input buffer to be processed by `AddPacketInfo`. The offset calculation assumes a record header has been parsed when it has not, leading to a negative offset.\n   - **Data Exposure:** The over-read buffer, which may contain sensitive data, is made available through the `ssl->timeoutInfo->packets` structure, which is exposed to user through the `wolfSSL_connect_ex` and `wolfSSL_accept_ex` functions if a callback is registered for timeouts\n   - **Vulnerable Versions:** wolfSSL versions before 5.5.2 are affected.\n\n**4. Remediation:**\n   - The use of `WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS` in production is strongly discouraged.\n   - The flawed logic in `tls13.c:DoTls13HandShakeMsgType` needs to be corrected to account for the absence of a record layer header when calculating the input buffer pointer.\n\n**5. Additional Notes:**\n   - The vulnerability was discovered using the `tlspuffin` fuzzer.\n   - The fix was implemented quickly by the wolfSSL team.\n   - While a systematic exploit for RCE is not mentioned, the information disclosure vulnerability is of significant concern in sensitive deployments using callbacks for logging or other similar functions.\n\nIn summary, CVE-2022-42905 is a heap-buffer over-read vulnerability in wolfSSL caused by incorrect pointer arithmetic when using the `WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS` macro. It can be triggered by malicious network traffic and could expose sensitive information through logging mechanisms.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 126 | Buffer Over-read | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.317 |\n| 2 | 125 | Out-of-bounds Read | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.251 |\n| 3 | 1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.241 |\n| 4 | 295 | Improper Certificate Validation | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.239 |\n| 5 | 122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.238 |\n| 6 | 124 | Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow') | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.566 |\n| 7 | 193 | Off-by-one Error | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.238 |\n| 9 | 319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.232 |\n| 10 | 909 | Missing Initialization of Resource | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.230 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis typically occurs when the pointer or its index is incremented to a position beyond the bounds of the buffer or when pointer arithmetic results in a position outside of the valid memory location to name a few.

This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may\n         become a very small or negative number.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOverflow: The terms \"overflow\" and \"wraparound\" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.\nWraparound: The terms \"overflow\" and \"wraparound\" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.\nwrap, wrap-around, wrap around: Alternate spellings of \"wraparound\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with \"overflow,\" \"underflow,\" and \"wraparound\" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called \"underflows\").\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\n\"Integer overflow\" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.\n\n\nA \"wraparound\" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.\n\n\n\"Overflow\" is sometimes conflated with \"wraparound\" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.\n\n\nThe \"overflow\" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use \"overflow\" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using \"underflow\" for exceeding the minimum.\n\n\nSome people use \"overflow\" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses \"underflow\" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.\n\n\nSee [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.\n\n\n**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany communication channels can be \"sniffed\" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.\n\n\nApplicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.\n\n\nWhen full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to \"sniff\" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information. \n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-311\nChildOf -> CWE-311\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29519:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends sensitive information in plaintext, including passwords and session tokens.\n- **CVE-2022-30312:** Building Controller uses a protocol that transmits authentication credentials in plaintext.\n- **CVE-2022-31204:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends password in plaintext.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not initialize a critical resource.\n\n### Extended Description\nMany resources require initialization before they can be properly used. If a resource is not initialized, it could contain unpredictable or expired data, or it could be initialized to defaults that are invalid. This can have security implications when the resource is expected to have certain properties or values.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nCanPrecede -> CWE-908\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-20739:** A variable that has its value set in a conditional statement is sometimes used when the conditional fails, sometimes causing data leakage\n- **CVE-2005-1036:** Chain: Bypass of access restrictions due to improper authorization (CWE-862) of a user results from an improperly initialized (CWE-909) I/O permission bitmap\n\n"
