This indicates a race condition.\n*   **Weaknesses:** Race condition where a malicious operation can be interleaved due to the lack of synchronization\n*   **Impact:** A local attacker can interleave malicious operations, likely leading to unexpected behavior or potentially other exploitable conditions. The document doesn't specify the exact impact, but a race condition can lead to a variety of issues, including denial-of-service, privilege escalation, or data corruption.\n*   **Attack Vectors:** Local access to the device is required.

This implies that the attacker has already gained some level of access.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The provided text is from a Samsung security bulletin detailing several vulnerabilities and their corresponding fixes. The vulnerability is referred to as **SVE-2022-0689**, which is mapped to CVE-2022-33691.\n* The vulnerability affects devices with the Exynos 9820 chipset\n* The fix involves adding proper synchronization points to prevent the race condition.\n*   This vulnerability is categorized as \"Moderate\" in severity by Samsung.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') | Class | Allowed-with-Review | alternate_terms | 1.000 |\n| 2 | 367 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.188 |\n| 3 | 667 | Improper Locking | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.149 |\n| 4 | 476 | NULL Pointer Dereference | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.145 |\n| 5 | 662 | Improper Synchronization | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.141 |\n| 6 | 363 | Race Condition Enabling Link Following | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.596 |\n| 7 | 609 | Double-Checked Locking | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 213 | Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.131 |\n| 9 | 703 | Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions | Pillar | Discouraged | sparse | 0.125 |\n| 10 | 1285 | Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.125 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nA race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.\n\n\nA race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:\n\n\n  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.\n\n  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.\n\nA race condition exists when an \"interfering code sequence\" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.\n\nThe interfering code sequence could be \"trusted\" or \"untrusted.\" A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nRace Condition\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-691\nCanPrecede -> CWE-416\nCanPrecede -> CWE-476\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed.

However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.\n\n**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use.

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** TOCTOU issues do not always involve symlinks, and not every symlink issue is a TOCTOU problem.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Non-symlink TOCTOU issues are not reported frequently, but they are likely to occur in code that attempts to be secure.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2015-1743:** TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed\n- **CVE-2003-0813:** A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.\n- **CVE-2004-0594:** PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nLocking is a type of synchronization behavior that ensures that multiple independently-operating processes or threads do not interfere with each other when accessing the same resource. All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms. Multiple entries are dependent on this research, which includes relationships to concurrency, race conditions, reentrant functions, etc. CWE-662 and its children - including CWE-667, CWE-820, CWE-821, and others - may need to be modified significantly, along with their relationships.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2009-0935:** Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice\n- **CVE-2010-4210:** function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNPD: Common abbreviation for Null Pointer Dereference\nnull deref: Common abbreviation for Null Pointer Dereference\nNPE: Common abbreviation for Null Pointer Exception\nnil pointer dereference: used for access of nil in Go programs\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-710\nChildOf -> CWE-754\nChildOf -> CWE-754\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2005-3274:** race condition causes a table to be corrupted if a timer activates while it is being modified, leading to resultant NULL dereference; also involves locking.\n- **CVE-2002-1912:** large number of packets leads to NULL dereference\n- **CVE-2005-0772:** packet with invalid error status value triggers NULL dereference\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nSynchronization refers to a variety of behaviors and mechanisms that allow two or more independently-operating processes or threads to ensure that they operate on shared resources in predictable ways that do not interfere with each other. Some shared resource operations cannot be executed atomically; that is, multiple steps must be guaranteed to execute sequentially, without any interference by other processes. Synchronization mechanisms vary widely, but they may include locking, mutexes, and semaphores. When a multi-step operation on a shared resource cannot be guaranteed to execute independent of interference, then the resulting behavior can be unpredictable. Improper synchronization could lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-664\nChildOf -> CWE-691\nCanPrecede -> CWE-362\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms. Multiple entries are dependent on this research, which includes relationships to concurrency, race conditions, reentrant functions, etc. CWE-662 and its children - including CWE-667, CWE-820, CWE-821, and others - may need to be modified significantly, along with their relationships.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2009-0935:** Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-363: Race Condition Enabling Link Following\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product checks the status of a file or directory before accessing it, which produces a race condition in which the file can be replaced with a link before the access is performed, causing the product to access the wrong file.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhile developers might expect that there is a very narrow time window between the time of check and time of use, there is still a race condition. An attacker could cause the product to slow down (e.g. with memory consumption), causing the time window to become larger. Alternately, in some situations, the attacker could win the race by performing a large number of attacks.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-367\nCanPrecede -> CWE-59\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is already covered by the \"Link Following\" weakness (CWE-59). It is included here because so many people associate race conditions with link problems; however, not all link following issues involve race conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-609: Double-Checked Locking\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses double-checked locking to access a resource without the overhead of explicit synchronization, but the locking is insufficient.\n\n### Extended Description\nDouble-checked locking refers to the situation where a programmer checks to see if a resource has been initialized, grabs a lock, checks again to see if the resource has been initialized, and then performs the initialization if it has not occurred yet. This should not be done, as it is not guaranteed to work in all languages and on all architectures. In summary, other threads may not be operating inside the synchronous block and are not guaranteed to see the operations execute in the same order as they would appear inside the synchronous block.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-667\nCanPrecede -> CWE-367\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-213: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product's intended functionality exposes information to certain actors in accordance with the developer's security policy, but this information is regarded as sensitive according to the intended security policies of other stakeholders such as the product's administrator, users, or others whose information is being processed.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen handling information, the developer must consider whether the information is regarded as sensitive by different stakeholders, such as users or administrators. Each stakeholder effectively has its own intended security policy that the product is expected to uphold. When a developer does not treat that information as sensitive, this can introduce a vulnerability that violates the expectations of the product's users.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry is being considered for deprecation. It overlaps many other entries related to information exposures. It might not be essential to preserve this entry, since other key stakeholder policies are covered elsewhere, e.g. personal privacy leaks (CWE-359) and system-level exposures that are important to system administrators (CWE-497).\n\n**[Theoretical]** In vulnerability theory terms, this covers cases in which the developer's Intended Policy allows the information to be made available, but the information might be in violation of a Universal Policy in which the product's administrator should have control over which information is considered sensitive and therefore should not be exposed.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-1725:** Script calls phpinfo()\n- **CVE-2004-0033:** Script calls phpinfo()\n- **CVE-2003-1181:** Script calls phpinfo()\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction:** Pillar\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nNone\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n**Comments:** Consider children or descendants of this entry instead.\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is a high-level class that might have some overlap with other classes. It could be argued that even \"normal\" weaknesses such as buffer overflows involve unusual or exceptional conditions. In that sense, this might be an inherent aspect of most other weaknesses within CWE, similar to API Abuse (CWE-227) and Indicator of Poor Code Quality (CWE-398). However, this entry is currently intended to unify disparate concepts that do not have other places within the Research Concepts view (CWE-1000).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **[REF-1374]:** Chain: JavaScript-based cryptocurrency library can fall back to the insecure Math.random() function instead of reporting a failure (CWE-392), thus reducing the entropy (CWE-332) and leading to generation of non-unique cryptographic keys for Bitcoin wallets (CWE-1391)\n- **CVE-2022-22224:** Chain: an operating system does not properly process malformed Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Type/Length/Value Identifiers (TLV) (CWE-703), which can cause the process to enter an infinite loop (CWE-835)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nOften, indexable resources such as memory buffers or files can be accessed using a specific position, index, or offset, such as an index for an array or a position for a file. When untrusted input is not properly validated before it is used as an index, attackers could access (or attempt to access) unauthorized portions of these resources. This could be used to cause buffer overflows, excessive resource allocation, or trigger unexpected failures. \n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-20\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2005-0369:** large ID in packet used as array index\n- **CVE-2001-1009:** negative array index as argument to POP LIST command\n\n",

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** TOCTOU issues do not always involve symlinks, and not every symlink issue is a TOCTOU problem.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Non-symlink TOCTOU issues are not reported frequently, but they are likely to occur in code that attempts to be secure.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2015-1743:** TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed\n- **CVE-2003-0813:** A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.\n- **CVE-2004-0594:** PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nLocking is a type of synchronization behavior that ensures that multiple independently-operating processes or threads do not interfere with each other when accessing the same resource. All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms. Multiple entries are dependent on this research, which includes relationships to concurrency, race conditions, reentrant functions, etc. CWE-662 and its children - including CWE-667, CWE-820, CWE-821, and others - may need to be modified significantly, along with their relationships.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2009-0935:** Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice\n- **CVE-2010-4210:** function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNPD: Common abbreviation for Null Pointer Dereference\nnull deref: Common abbreviation for Null Pointer Dereference\nNPE: Common abbreviation for Null Pointer Exception\nnil pointer dereference: used for access of nil in Go programs\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-710\nChildOf -> CWE-754\nChildOf -> CWE-754\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2005-3274:** race condition causes a table to be corrupted if a timer activates while it is being modified, leading to resultant NULL dereference; also involves locking.\n- **CVE-2002-1912:** large number of packets leads to NULL dereference\n- **CVE-2005-0772:** packet with invalid error status value triggers NULL dereference\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nSynchronization refers to a variety of behaviors and mechanisms that allow two or more independently-operating processes or threads to ensure that they operate on shared resources in predictable ways that do not interfere with each other. Some shared resource operations cannot be executed atomically; that is, multiple steps must be guaranteed to execute sequentially, without any interference by other processes. Synchronization mechanisms vary widely, but they may include locking, mutexes, and semaphores. When a multi-step operation on a shared resource cannot be guaranteed to execute independent of interference, then the resulting behavior can be unpredictable. Improper synchronization could lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-664\nChildOf -> CWE-691\nCanPrecede -> CWE-362\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms. Multiple entries are dependent on this research, which includes relationships to concurrency, race conditions, reentrant functions, etc. CWE-662 and its children - including CWE-667, CWE-820, CWE-821, and others - may need to be modified significantly, along with their relationships.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2009-0935:** Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-363: Race Condition Enabling Link Following\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product checks the status of a file or directory before accessing it, which produces a race condition in which the file can be replaced with a link before the access is performed, causing the product to access the wrong file.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhile developers might expect that there is a very narrow time window between the time of check and time of use, there is still a race condition. An attacker could cause the product to slow down (e.g. with memory consumption), causing the time window to become larger. Alternately, in some situations, the attacker could win the race by performing a large number of attacks.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-367\nCanPrecede -> CWE-59\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is already covered by the \"Link Following\" weakness (CWE-59). It is included here because so many people associate race conditions with link problems; however, not all link following issues involve race conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-609: Double-Checked Locking\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses double-checked locking to access a resource without the overhead of explicit synchronization, but the locking is insufficient.\n\n### Extended Description\nDouble-checked locking refers to the situation where a programmer checks to see if a resource has been initialized, grabs a lock, checks again to see if the resource has been initialized, and then performs the initialization if it has not occurred yet. This should not be done, as it is not guaranteed to work in all languages and on all architectures. In summary, other threads may not be operating inside the synchronous block and are not guaranteed to see the operations execute in the same order as they would appear inside the synchronous block.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-667\nCanPrecede -> CWE-367\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-213: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product's intended functionality exposes information to certain actors in accordance with the developer's security policy, but this information is regarded as sensitive according to the intended security policies of other stakeholders such as the product's administrator, users, or others whose information is being processed.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen handling information, the developer must consider whether the information is regarded as sensitive by different stakeholders, such as users or administrators. Each stakeholder effectively has its own intended security policy that the product is expected to uphold. When a developer does not treat that information as sensitive, this can introduce a vulnerability that violates the expectations of the product's users.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry is being considered for deprecation. It overlaps many other entries related to information exposures. It might not be essential to preserve this entry, since other key stakeholder policies are covered elsewhere, e.g. personal privacy leaks (CWE-359) and system-level exposures that are important to system administrators (CWE-497).\n\n**[Theoretical]** In vulnerability theory terms, this covers cases in which the developer's Intended Policy allows the information to be made available, but the information might be in violation of a Universal Policy in which the product's administrator should have control over which information is considered sensitive and therefore should not be exposed.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-1725:** Script calls phpinfo()\n- **CVE-2004-0033:** Script calls phpinfo()\n- **CVE-2003-1181:** Script calls phpinfo()\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction:** Pillar\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nNone\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n**Comments:** Consider children or descendants of this entry instead.\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is a high-level class that might have some overlap with other classes. It could be argued that even \"normal\" weaknesses such as buffer overflows involve unusual or exceptional conditions. In that sense, this might be an inherent aspect of most other weaknesses within CWE, similar to API Abuse (CWE-227) and Indicator of Poor Code Quality (CWE-398). However, this entry is currently intended to unify disparate concepts that do not have other places within the Research Concepts view (CWE-1000).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **[REF-1374]:** Chain: JavaScript-based cryptocurrency library can fall back to the insecure Math.random() function instead of reporting a failure (CWE-392), thus reducing the entropy (CWE-332) and leading to generation of non-unique cryptographic keys for Bitcoin wallets (CWE-1391)\n- **CVE-2022-22224:** Chain: an operating system does not properly process malformed Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Type/Length/Value Identifiers (TLV) (CWE-703), which can cause the process to enter an infinite loop (CWE-835)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nOften, indexable resources such as memory buffers or files can be accessed using a specific position, index, or offset, such as an index for an array or a position for a file. When untrusted input is not properly validated before it is used as an index, attackers could access (or attempt to access) unauthorized portions of these resources. This could be used to cause buffer overflows, excessive resource allocation, or trigger unexpected failures. \n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-20\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2005-0369:** large ID in packet used as array index\n- **CVE-2001-1009:** negative array index as argument to POP LIST command\n\n"
