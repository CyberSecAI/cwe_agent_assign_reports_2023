CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') (Score: 238.21)\n\nThe product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow....\n\n### 2. CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (Score: 231.04)\n\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently....\n\n### 3. CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity (Score: 227.08)\n\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached....\n\n### 4. CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference (Score: 225.69)\n\nThe product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL....\n\n### 5. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 222.14)\n\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties....\n\n## WEAKNESS: 'invalid input'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1.

CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity (Score: 222.63)\n\nThe product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles....\n\n### 4. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 222.14)\n\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties....\n\n### 5. CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input (Score: 218.17)\n\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties....\n\n## IMPACT: 'denial of service'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this IMPACT:\n\n### 1. CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (Score: 231.04)\n\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently....\n\n### 2.
