Specifically, when a user attempts to change their password and provides an incorrect current password, there was no limit on the number of attempts before this commit. This allowed for brute-force attacks on user accounts.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Missing Rate Limiting:** The primary weakness was the absence of rate limiting on password change attempts, making it susceptible to brute-force attacks.\n- **Lack of lockout mechanism**: There was no mechanism to temporarily lock out an account after a number of failed login attempts.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Account Compromise:** An attacker could potentially brute-force a user's password by repeatedly attempting to change it using an incorrect current password until the new password was discovered.\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):** While not the primary impact, repeatedly triggering failed password change attempts may cause some degree of disruption.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The attacker would need to access the password change functionality of the application, which usually requires being logged in.\n- The attack is performed by repeatedly trying to update the user's password with the correct username but a different password until the new password is discovered.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Valid User Credentials (for initial login):** An attacker needs to be able to log in to a user account for the first time.\n- **Target Account Username:** The attacker needs to know the username of the account they are trying to compromise or an account which he already has valid credentials.\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to interact with the web application.\n\n**Mitigation:**\nThe commit addresses this vulnerability by:\n1. Introducing a maximum number of incorrect password change attempts (`CHANGE_PASSWORD_MAX_ATTEMPT = 5`).\n2. Implementing a counter in the user's session (`CHANGE_PASSWORD_ATTEMPTS`) to track failed attempts.\n3. If the number of failed attempts exceeds the maximum limit, the session is cleared, and the user is redirected to the login page.\n4. A flash message is displayed to the user that they have been logged out due to excessive incorrect password attempts.\n\n**Additional Information:**\nThe provided content also includes the following useful information:\n- **Commit Details:** The commit `b5e3bb0a98268d18ceead36ab9b2b7eaacd659a8` introduced the fix.\n- **Affected Files:** The relevant files modified by this commit were `rdiffweb/controller/page_pref_general.py`, `rdiffweb/core/login.py`, and `rdiffweb/core/model/_user.py`.\n- **Testing:** The tests were also updated in `rdiffweb/controller/tests/test_page_prefs_general.py` to include a test for too many failed password change attempts.\n- **Code Context:** There's code to validate the length of the password.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe provided content clearly shows the root cause of the vulnerability related to CVE-2022-3273 and the fix implemented, which is to introduce a rate limit on password change attempts.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 770 | Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.187 |\n| 2 | 774 | Allocation of File Descriptors or Handles Without Limits or Throttling | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.146 |\n| 3 | 789 | Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.140 |\n| 4 | 1325 | Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.136 |\n| 5 | 614 | Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.134 |\n| 6 | 410 | Insufficient Resource Pool | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.438 |\n| 7 | 911 | Improper Update of Reference Count | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 289 | Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.123 |\n| 9 | 130 | Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.113 |\n| 10 | 409 | Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data (Data Amplification) | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.111 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nCode frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-400\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nChildOf -> CWE-400\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).\n\n**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. \"Resource exhaustion\" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..\n- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-774: Allocation of File Descriptors or Handles Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product allocates file descriptors or handles on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on how many descriptors can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis can cause the product to consume all available file descriptors or handles, which can prevent other processes from performing critical file processing operations.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nFile Descriptor Exhaustion\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-770\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nStack Exhaustion: When a weakness allocates excessive memory on the stack, it is often described as \"stack exhaustion,\" which is a technical impact of the weakness. This technical impact is often encountered as a consequence of CWE-789 and/or CWE-1325.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-770\nCanPrecede -> CWE-476\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness can be closely associated with integer overflows (CWE-190). Integer overflow attacks would concentrate on providing an extremely large number that triggers an overflow that causes less memory to be allocated than expected. By providing a large value that does not trigger an integer overflow, the attacker could still cause excessive amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**[Applicable Platform]** \n\nUncontrolled memory allocation is possible in many languages, such as dynamic array allocation in perl or initial size parameters in Collections in Java. However, languages like C and C++ where programmers have the power to more directly control memory management will be more susceptible.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2010-3701:** program uses ::alloca() for encoding messages, but large messages trigger segfault\n- **CVE-2008-1708:** memory consumption and daemon exit by specifying a large value in a length field\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhile the product might limit the amount of memory that is allocated in a single operation for a single object (such as a malloc of an array), if an attacker can cause multiple objects to be allocated in separate operations, then this might cause higher total memory consumption than the developer intended, leading to a denial of service.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nStack Exhaustion: When a weakness allocates excessive memory on the stack, it is often described as \"stack exhaustion,\" which is a technical impact of the weakness. This technical impact is often encountered as a consequence of CWE-789 and/or CWE-1325.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-770\nPeerOf -> CWE-789\nCanPrecede -> CWE-476\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-36049:** JavaScript-based packet decoder uses concatenation of many small strings, causing out-of-memory (OOM) condition\n- **CVE-2019-20176:** Product allocates a new buffer on the stack for each file in a directory, allowing stack exhaustion\n- **CVE-2013-1591:** Chain: an integer overflow (CWE-190) in the image size calculation causes an infinite loop (CWE-835) which sequentially allocates buffers without limits (CWE-1325) until the stack is full.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions is not set, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-319\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2004-0462:** A product does not set the Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session with the product.\n- **CVE-2008-3663:** A product does not set the secure flag for the session cookie in an https session, which can cause the cookie to be sent in http requests and make it easier for remote attackers to capture this cookie.\n- **CVE-2008-3662:** A product does not set the secure flag for the session cookie in an https session, which can cause the cookie to be sent in http requests and make it easier for remote attackers to capture this cookie.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product's resource pool is not large enough to handle peak demand, which allows an attacker to prevent others from accessing the resource by using a (relatively) large number of requests for resources.\n\n### Extended Description\nFrequently the consequence is a \"flood\" of connection or sessions.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-664\nCanPrecede -> CWE-400\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

When the reference count reaches zero, the resource can be de-allocated or reused because there are no more objects that use it. If the reference count accidentally reaches zero, then the resource might be released too soon, even though it is still in use. If all objects no longer use the resource, but the reference count is not zero, then the resource might not ever be released.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-664\nCanPrecede -> CWE-672\nCanPrecede -> CWE-772\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-0574:** chain: reference count is not decremented, leading to memory leak in OS by sending ICMP packets.\n- **CVE-2004-0114:** Reference count for shared memory not decremented when a function fails, potentially allowing unprivileged users to read kernel memory.\n- **CVE-2006-3741:** chain: improper reference count tracking leads to file descriptor consumption\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs authentication based on the name of a resource being accessed, or the name of the actor performing the access, but it does not properly check all possible names for that resource or actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Overlaps equivalent encodings, canonicalization, authorization, multiple trailing slash, trailing space, mixed case, and other equivalence issues.\n\n**[Theoretical]** Alternate names are useful in data driven manipulation attacks, not just for authentication.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2003-0317:** Protection mechanism that restricts URL access can be bypassed using URL encoding.\n- **CVE-2004-0847:** Bypass of authentication for files using \"\\\" (backslash) or \"%5C\" (encoded backslash).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.\n\n### Extended Description\nIf an attacker can manipulate the length parameter associated with an input such that it is inconsistent with the actual length of the input, this can be leveraged to cause the target application to behave in unexpected, and possibly, malicious ways. One of the possible motives for doing so is to pass in arbitrarily large input to the application. Another possible motivation is the modification of application state by including invalid data for subsequent properties of the application. Such weaknesses commonly lead to attacks such as buffer overflows and execution of arbitrary code.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nlength manipulation\nlength tampering\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-240\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-805\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This probably overlaps other categories including zero-length issues.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: \"Heartbleed\" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.\n- **CVE-2009-2299:** Web application firewall consumes excessive memory when an HTTP request contains a large Content-Length value but no POST data.\n- **CVE-2001-0825:** Buffer overflow in internal string handling routine allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a length argument of zero or less, which disables the length check.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-409: Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data (Data Amplification)\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles a compressed input with a very high compression ratio that produces a large output.\n\n### Extended Description\nAn example of data amplification is a \"decompression bomb,\" a small ZIP file that can produce a large amount of data when it is decompressed.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-405\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
