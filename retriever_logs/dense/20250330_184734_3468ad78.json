Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness is different than CWE-242 (Use of Inherently Dangerous Function). CWE-242 covers functions with such significant security problems that they can never be guaranteed to be safe. Some functions, if used properly, do not directly pose a security risk, but can introduce a weakness if not called correctly. These are regarded as potentially dangerous. A well-known example is the strcpy() function. When provided with a destination buffer that is larger than its source, strcpy() will not overflow. However, it is so often misused that some developers prohibit strcpy() entirely.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2007-1470:** Library has multiple buffer overflows using sprintf() and strcpy()\n- **CVE-2009-3849:** Buffer overflow using strcat()\n- **CVE-2006-2114:** Buffer overflow using strcpy()\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen creating commands using interpolation into a string, developers may assume that only the arguments/options that they specify will be processed. This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-77\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** At one layer of abstraction, this can overlap other weaknesses that have whitespace problems, e.g. injection of javascript into attributes of HTML tags.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-36069:** Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n- **CVE-1999-0113:** Canonical Example - \"-froot\" argument is passed on to another program, where the \"-f\" causes execution as user \"root\"\n- **CVE-2001-0150:** Web browser executes Telnet sessions using command line arguments that are specified by the web site, which could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nShell injection\nShell metacharacters\nOS Command Injection\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-88\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** The \"OS command injection\" phrase carries different meanings to different people. For some people, it only refers to cases in which the attacker injects command separators into arguments for an application-controlled program that is being invoked. For some people, it refers to any type of attack that can allow the attacker to execute OS commands of their own choosing. This usage could include untrusted search path weaknesses (CWE-426) that cause the application to find and execute an attacker-controlled program. Further complicating the issue is the case when argument injection (CWE-88) allows alternate command-line switches or options to be inserted into the command line, such as an \"-exec\" switch whose purpose may be to execute the subsequent argument as a command (this -exec switch exists in the UNIX \"find\" command, for example). In this latter case, however, CWE-88 could be regarded as the primary weakness in a chain with CWE-78.\n\n**[Research Gap]** More investigation is needed into the distinction between the OS command injection variants, including the role with argument injection (CWE-88). Equivalent distinctions may exist in other injection-related problems such as SQL injection.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-10987:** OS command injection in Wi-Fi router, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-10221:** Template functionality in network configuration management tool allows OS command injection, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-9054:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in username parameter, leading to OS command injection (CWE-78), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an operation at a privilege level that is higher than the minimum level required, which creates new weaknesses or amplifies the consequences of other weaknesses.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nNew weaknesses can be exposed because running with extra privileges, such as root or Administrator, can disable the normal security checks being performed by the operating system or surrounding environment. Other pre-existing weaknesses can turn into security vulnerabilities if they occur while operating at raised privileges.\n\n\nPrivilege management functions can behave in some less-than-obvious ways, and they have different quirks on different platforms. These inconsistencies are particularly pronounced if you are transitioning from one non-root user to another. Signal handlers and spawned processes run at the privilege of the owning process, so if a process is running as root when a signal fires or a sub-process is executed, the signal handler or sub-process will operate with root privileges.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-269\nChildOf -> CWE-657\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** There is a close association with CWE-653 (Insufficient Separation of Privileges). CWE-653 is about providing separate components for each privilege; CWE-250 is about ensuring that each component has the least amount of privileges possible.\n\n**[Maintenance]** CWE-271, CWE-272, and CWE-250 are all closely related and possibly overlapping. CWE-271 is probably better suited as a category. Both CWE-272 and CWE-250 are in active use by the community. The \"least privilege\" phrase has multiple interpretations.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2007-4217:** FTP client program on a certain OS runs with setuid privileges and has a buffer overflow. Most clients do not need extra privileges, so an overflow is not a vulnerability for those clients.\n- **CVE-2008-1877:** Program runs with privileges and calls another program with the same privileges, which allows read of arbitrary files.\n- **CVE-2007-5159:** OS incorrectly installs a program with setuid privileges, allowing users to gain privileges.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-912: Hidden Functionality\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product contains functionality that is not documented, not part of the specification, and not accessible through an interface or command sequence that is obvious to the product's users or administrators.\n\n### Extended Description\nHidden functionality can take many forms, such as intentionally malicious code, \"Easter Eggs\" that contain extraneous functionality such as games, developer-friendly shortcuts that reduce maintenance or support costs such as hard-coded accounts, etc. From a security perspective, even when the functionality is not intentionally malicious or damaging, it can increase the product's attack surface and expose additional weaknesses beyond what is already exposed by the intended functionality. Even if it is not easily accessible, the hidden functionality could be useful for attacks that modify the control flow of the application.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-684\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-31260:** Chain: a digital asset management program has an undisclosed backdoor in the legacy version of a PHP script (CWE-912) that could allow an unauthenticated user to export metadata (CWE-306)\n- **CVE-2022-3203:** A wireless access point manual specifies that the only method of configuration is via web interface (CWE-1059), but there is an undisclosed telnet server that was activated by default (CWE-912).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of a command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany protocols and products have their own custom command language. While OS or shell command strings are frequently discovered and targeted, developers may not realize that these other command languages might also be vulnerable to attacks.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nCommand injection: an attack-oriented phrase for this weakness. Note: often used when \"OS command injection\" (CWE-78) was intended.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-74\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** CWE-77 is often misused when OS command injection (CWE-78) was intended instead [REF-1287].\n**Comments:** Ensure that the analysis focuses on the root-cause error that allows the execution of commands, as there are many weaknesses that can lead to this consequence. See Terminology Notes. If the weakness involves a command language besides OS shell invocation, then CWE-77 could be used.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-78: OS Command Injection\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nThe \"command injection\" phrase carries different meanings, either as an attack or as a technical impact. The most common usage of \"command injection\" refers to the more-accurate OS command injection (CWE-78), but there are many command languages.\n\n\nIn vulnerability-focused analysis, the phrase may refer to any situation in which the adversary can execute commands of their own choosing, i.e., the focus is on the risk and/or technical impact of exploitation. Many proof-of-concept exploits focus on the ability to execute commands and may emphasize \"command injection.\" However, there are dozens of weaknesses that can allow execution of commands. That is, the ability to execute commands could be resultant from another weakness.\n\n\nTo some, \"command injection\" can include cases in which the functionality intentionally allows the user to specify an entire command, which is then executed. In this case, the root cause weakness might be related to missing or incorrect authorization, since an adversary should not be able to specify arbitrary commands, but some users or admins are allowed.\n\n\nCWE-77 and its descendants are specifically focused on behaviors in which the product is intentionally building a command to execute, and the adversary can inject separators into the command or otherwise change the command being executed.\n\n\n**[Other]** \n\nCommand injection is a common problem with wrapper programs.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-1509:** injection of sed script syntax (\"sed injection\")\n- **CVE-2024-5184:** API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.\n- **CVE-2020-11698:** anti-spam product allows injection of SNMP commands into confiuration file\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDenylist / Deny List: This is used by CWE and CAPEC instead of other commonly-used terms. Its counterpart is allowlist.\nBlocklist / Block List: This is often used by security tools such as firewalls, email or web gateways, proxies, etc.\nBlacklist / Black List: This term is frequently used, but usage has been declining as organizations have started to adopt other terms.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-693\nChildOf -> CWE-1023\nCanPrecede -> CWE-79\nCanPrecede -> CWE-78\nCanPrecede -> CWE-434\nCanPrecede -> CWE-98\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nMultiple interpretation errors can indirectly introduce inputs that should be disallowed. For example, a list of dangerous shell metacharacters might not include a metacharacter that only has meaning in one particular shell, not all of them; or a check for XSS manipulations might ignore an unusual construct that is supported by one web browser, but not others.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the \"\\\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.\n- **CVE-2008-2309:** product uses a denylist to identify potentially dangerous content, allowing attacker to bypass a warning\n- **CVE-2005-2782:** PHP remote file inclusion in web application that filters \"http\" and \"https\" URLs, but not \"ftp\".\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nStack Overflow: \"Stack Overflow\" is often used to mean the same thing as stack-based buffer overflow, however it is also used on occasion to mean stack exhaustion, usually a result from an excessively recursive function call. Due to the ambiguity of the term, use of stack overflow to describe either circumstance is discouraged.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-788\nChildOf -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** Stack-based buffer overflows can instantiate in return address overwrites, stack pointer overwrites or frame pointer overwrites. They can also be considered function pointer overwrites, array indexer overwrites or write-what-where condition, etc.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-35395:** Stack-based buffer overflows in SFK for wifi chipset used for IoT/embedded devices, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input or data, but it does\n        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the\n        properties that are required to process the data safely and\n        correctly.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nInput validation is a frequently-used technique for checking potentially dangerous inputs in order to ensure that the inputs are safe for processing within the code, or when communicating with other components. When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nInput validation is not the only technique for processing input, however. Other techniques attempt to transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well (see CWE-138 for more examples.)\n\n\nInput validation can be applied to:\n\n\n  - raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.\n\n  - metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size\n\nData can be simple or structured. Structured data can be composed of many nested layers, composed of combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or structured data.\n\nMany properties of raw data or metadata may need to be validated upon entry into the code, such as:\n\n\n  - specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.\n\n  - implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size\n\n  - indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures\n\n  - symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.\n\n  - well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax \n\n  - lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token\n\n  - specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)\n\n  - consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.\n\n  - conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic \n\n  - equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same\n\n  - authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data\n\nImplied or derived properties of data must often be calculated or inferred by the code itself. Errors in deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor to improper input validation. \n\nNote that \"input validation\" has very different meanings to different people, or within different classification schemes. Caution must be used when referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it. For example, some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control to an attacker over an input when they should not be able to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred to as input validation.\n\n\nFinally, it is important to emphasize that the distinctions between input validation and output escaping are often blurred, and developers must be careful to understand the difference, including how input validation is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, this valid name cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\nPeerOf -> CWE-345\nCanPrecede -> CWE-22\nCanPrecede -> CWE-41\nCanPrecede -> CWE-74\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-770\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis. It is also a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Consider lower-level children such as Improper Use of Validation Framework (CWE-1173) or improper validation involving specific types or properties of input such as Specified Quantity (CWE-1284); Specified Index, Position, or Offset (CWE-1285); Syntactic Correctness (CWE-1286); Specified Type (CWE-1287); Consistency within Input (CWE-1288); or Unsafe Equivalence (CWE-1289).\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-1284: Specified Quantity\n- CWE-1285: Specified Index, Position, or Offset\n- CWE-1286: Syntactic Correctness\n- CWE-1287: Specified Type\n- CWE-1288: Consistency within Input\n- CWE-1289: Unsafe Equivalence\n- CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nCWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.\n\n\n**[Maintenance]** As of 2020, this entry is used more often than preferred, and it is a source of frequent confusion. It is being actively modified for CWE 4.1 and subsequent versions.\n\n**[Maintenance]** Concepts such as validation, data transformation, and neutralization are being refined, so relationships between CWE-20 and other entries such as CWE-707 may change in future versions, along with an update to the Vulnerability Theory document.\n\n**[Maintenance]** Input validation - whether missing or incorrect - is such an essential and widespread part of secure development that it is implicit in many different weaknesses. Traditionally, problems such as buffer overflows and XSS have been classified as input validation problems by many security professionals. However, input validation is not necessarily the only protection mechanism available for avoiding such problems, and in some cases it is not even sufficient. The CWE team has begun capturing these subtleties in chains within the Research Concepts view (CWE-1000), but more work is needed.\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nThe \"input validation\" term is extremely common, but it is used in many different ways. In some cases its usage can obscure the real underlying weakness or otherwise hide chaining and composite relationships.\n\n\nSome people use \"input validation\" as a general term that covers many different neutralization techniques for ensuring that input is appropriate, such as filtering, canonicalization, and escaping. Others use the term in a more narrow context to simply mean \"checking if an input conforms to expectations without changing it.\" CWE uses this more narrow interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n- **CVE-2021-30860:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) leads to integer overflow (CWE-190) in mobile OS, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-284: Improper Access Control\n**Abstraction:** Pillar\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAccess control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:\n\n\n  - Authentication (proving the identity of an actor)\n\n  - Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and\n\n  - Accountability (tracking of activities that were performed)\n\nWhen any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.\n\nThere are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:\n\n\n  - Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.\n\n  - Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthorization: The terms \"access control\" and \"authorization\" are often used interchangeably, although many people have distinct definitions. The CWE usage of \"access control\" is intended as a general term for the various mechanisms that restrict which users can access which resources, and \"authorization\" is more narrowly defined. It is unlikely that there will be community consensus on the use of these terms.\n\n### Relationships\nNone\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-284 is extremely high-level, a Pillar. Its name, \"Improper Access Control,\" is often misused in low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287] or by active use of the OWASP Top Ten, such as \"A01:2021-Broken Access Control\". It is not useful for trend analysis.\n**Comments:** Consider using descendants of CWE-284 that are more specific to the kind of access control involved, such as those involving authorization (Missing Authorization (CWE-862), Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863), Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource (CWE-732), etc.); authentication (Missing Authentication (CWE-306) or Weak Authentication (CWE-1390)); Incorrect User Management (CWE-286); Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints (CWE-923); etc.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n- Abstraction\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n- CWE-306: Missing Authentication\n- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n- CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** \n\nThis entry needs more work. Possible sub-categories include:\n\n\n  - Trusted group includes undesired entities (partially covered by CWE-286)\n\n  - Group can perform undesired actions\n\n  - ACL parse error does not fail closed\n\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-24985:** A form hosting website only checks the session authentication status for a single form, making it possible to bypass authentication when there are multiple forms\n- **CVE-2022-29238:** Access-control setting in web-based document collaboration tool is not properly implemented by the code, which prevents listing hidden directories but does not prevent direct requests to files in those directories.\n- **CVE-2022-23607:** Python-based HTTP library did not scope cookies to a particular domain such that \"supercookies\" could be sent to any domain on redirect\n\n",

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness is different than CWE-242 (Use of Inherently Dangerous Function). CWE-242 covers functions with such significant security problems that they can never be guaranteed to be safe. Some functions, if used properly, do not directly pose a security risk, but can introduce a weakness if not called correctly. These are regarded as potentially dangerous. A well-known example is the strcpy() function. When provided with a destination buffer that is larger than its source, strcpy() will not overflow. However, it is so often misused that some developers prohibit strcpy() entirely.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2007-1470:** Library has multiple buffer overflows using sprintf() and strcpy()\n- **CVE-2009-3849:** Buffer overflow using strcat()\n- **CVE-2006-2114:** Buffer overflow using strcpy()\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen creating commands using interpolation into a string, developers may assume that only the arguments/options that they specify will be processed. This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-77\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** At one layer of abstraction, this can overlap other weaknesses that have whitespace problems, e.g. injection of javascript into attributes of HTML tags.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-36069:** Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n- **CVE-1999-0113:** Canonical Example - \"-froot\" argument is passed on to another program, where the \"-f\" causes execution as user \"root\"\n- **CVE-2001-0150:** Web browser executes Telnet sessions using command line arguments that are specified by the web site, which could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nShell injection\nShell metacharacters\nOS Command Injection\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-88\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** The \"OS command injection\" phrase carries different meanings to different people. For some people, it only refers to cases in which the attacker injects command separators into arguments for an application-controlled program that is being invoked. For some people, it refers to any type of attack that can allow the attacker to execute OS commands of their own choosing. This usage could include untrusted search path weaknesses (CWE-426) that cause the application to find and execute an attacker-controlled program. Further complicating the issue is the case when argument injection (CWE-88) allows alternate command-line switches or options to be inserted into the command line, such as an \"-exec\" switch whose purpose may be to execute the subsequent argument as a command (this -exec switch exists in the UNIX \"find\" command, for example). In this latter case, however, CWE-88 could be regarded as the primary weakness in a chain with CWE-78.\n\n**[Research Gap]** More investigation is needed into the distinction between the OS command injection variants, including the role with argument injection (CWE-88). Equivalent distinctions may exist in other injection-related problems such as SQL injection.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-10987:** OS command injection in Wi-Fi router, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-10221:** Template functionality in network configuration management tool allows OS command injection, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-9054:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in username parameter, leading to OS command injection (CWE-78), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an operation at a privilege level that is higher than the minimum level required, which creates new weaknesses or amplifies the consequences of other weaknesses.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nNew weaknesses can be exposed because running with extra privileges, such as root or Administrator, can disable the normal security checks being performed by the operating system or surrounding environment. Other pre-existing weaknesses can turn into security vulnerabilities if they occur while operating at raised privileges.\n\n\nPrivilege management functions can behave in some less-than-obvious ways, and they have different quirks on different platforms. These inconsistencies are particularly pronounced if you are transitioning from one non-root user to another. Signal handlers and spawned processes run at the privilege of the owning process, so if a process is running as root when a signal fires or a sub-process is executed, the signal handler or sub-process will operate with root privileges.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-269\nChildOf -> CWE-657\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** There is a close association with CWE-653 (Insufficient Separation of Privileges). CWE-653 is about providing separate components for each privilege; CWE-250 is about ensuring that each component has the least amount of privileges possible.\n\n**[Maintenance]** CWE-271, CWE-272, and CWE-250 are all closely related and possibly overlapping. CWE-271 is probably better suited as a category. Both CWE-272 and CWE-250 are in active use by the community. The \"least privilege\" phrase has multiple interpretations.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2007-4217:** FTP client program on a certain OS runs with setuid privileges and has a buffer overflow. Most clients do not need extra privileges, so an overflow is not a vulnerability for those clients.\n- **CVE-2008-1877:** Program runs with privileges and calls another program with the same privileges, which allows read of arbitrary files.\n- **CVE-2007-5159:** OS incorrectly installs a program with setuid privileges, allowing users to gain privileges.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-912: Hidden Functionality\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product contains functionality that is not documented, not part of the specification, and not accessible through an interface or command sequence that is obvious to the product's users or administrators.\n\n### Extended Description\nHidden functionality can take many forms, such as intentionally malicious code, \"Easter Eggs\" that contain extraneous functionality such as games, developer-friendly shortcuts that reduce maintenance or support costs such as hard-coded accounts, etc. From a security perspective, even when the functionality is not intentionally malicious or damaging, it can increase the product's attack surface and expose additional weaknesses beyond what is already exposed by the intended functionality. Even if it is not easily accessible, the hidden functionality could be useful for attacks that modify the control flow of the application.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-684\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-31260:** Chain: a digital asset management program has an undisclosed backdoor in the legacy version of a PHP script (CWE-912) that could allow an unauthenticated user to export metadata (CWE-306)\n- **CVE-2022-3203:** A wireless access point manual specifies that the only method of configuration is via web interface (CWE-1059), but there is an undisclosed telnet server that was activated by default (CWE-912).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of a command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany protocols and products have their own custom command language. While OS or shell command strings are frequently discovered and targeted, developers may not realize that these other command languages might also be vulnerable to attacks.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nCommand injection: an attack-oriented phrase for this weakness. Note: often used when \"OS command injection\" (CWE-78) was intended.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-74\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** CWE-77 is often misused when OS command injection (CWE-78) was intended instead [REF-1287].\n**Comments:** Ensure that the analysis focuses on the root-cause error that allows the execution of commands, as there are many weaknesses that can lead to this consequence. See Terminology Notes. If the weakness involves a command language besides OS shell invocation, then CWE-77 could be used.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-78: OS Command Injection\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nThe \"command injection\" phrase carries different meanings, either as an attack or as a technical impact. The most common usage of \"command injection\" refers to the more-accurate OS command injection (CWE-78), but there are many command languages.\n\n\nIn vulnerability-focused analysis, the phrase may refer to any situation in which the adversary can execute commands of their own choosing, i.e., the focus is on the risk and/or technical impact of exploitation. Many proof-of-concept exploits focus on the ability to execute commands and may emphasize \"command injection.\" However, there are dozens of weaknesses that can allow execution of commands. That is, the ability to execute commands could be resultant from another weakness.\n\n\nTo some, \"command injection\" can include cases in which the functionality intentionally allows the user to specify an entire command, which is then executed. In this case, the root cause weakness might be related to missing or incorrect authorization, since an adversary should not be able to specify arbitrary commands, but some users or admins are allowed.\n\n\nCWE-77 and its descendants are specifically focused on behaviors in which the product is intentionally building a command to execute, and the adversary can inject separators into the command or otherwise change the command being executed.\n\n\n**[Other]** \n\nCommand injection is a common problem with wrapper programs.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-1509:** injection of sed script syntax (\"sed injection\")\n- **CVE-2024-5184:** API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.\n- **CVE-2020-11698:** anti-spam product allows injection of SNMP commands into confiuration file\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDenylist / Deny List: This is used by CWE and CAPEC instead of other commonly-used terms. Its counterpart is allowlist.\nBlocklist / Block List: This is often used by security tools such as firewalls, email or web gateways, proxies, etc.\nBlacklist / Black List: This term is frequently used, but usage has been declining as organizations have started to adopt other terms.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-693\nChildOf -> CWE-1023\nCanPrecede -> CWE-79\nCanPrecede -> CWE-78\nCanPrecede -> CWE-434\nCanPrecede -> CWE-98\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nMultiple interpretation errors can indirectly introduce inputs that should be disallowed. For example, a list of dangerous shell metacharacters might not include a metacharacter that only has meaning in one particular shell, not all of them; or a check for XSS manipulations might ignore an unusual construct that is supported by one web browser, but not others.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the \"\\\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.\n- **CVE-2008-2309:** product uses a denylist to identify potentially dangerous content, allowing attacker to bypass a warning\n- **CVE-2005-2782:** PHP remote file inclusion in web application that filters \"http\" and \"https\" URLs, but not \"ftp\".\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nStack Overflow: \"Stack Overflow\" is often used to mean the same thing as stack-based buffer overflow, however it is also used on occasion to mean stack exhaustion, usually a result from an excessively recursive function call. Due to the ambiguity of the term, use of stack overflow to describe either circumstance is discouraged.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-788\nChildOf -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** Stack-based buffer overflows can instantiate in return address overwrites, stack pointer overwrites or frame pointer overwrites. They can also be considered function pointer overwrites, array indexer overwrites or write-what-where condition, etc.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-35395:** Stack-based buffer overflows in SFK for wifi chipset used for IoT/embedded devices, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input or data, but it does\n        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the\n        properties that are required to process the data safely and\n        correctly.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nInput validation is a frequently-used technique for checking potentially dangerous inputs in order to ensure that the inputs are safe for processing within the code, or when communicating with other components. When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nInput validation is not the only technique for processing input, however. Other techniques attempt to transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well (see CWE-138 for more examples.)\n\n\nInput validation can be applied to:\n\n\n  - raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.\n\n  - metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size\n\nData can be simple or structured. Structured data can be composed of many nested layers, composed of combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or structured data.\n\nMany properties of raw data or metadata may need to be validated upon entry into the code, such as:\n\n\n  - specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.\n\n  - implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size\n\n  - indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures\n\n  - symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.\n\n  - well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax \n\n  - lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token\n\n  - specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)\n\n  - consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.\n\n  - conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic \n\n  - equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same\n\n  - authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data\n\nImplied or derived properties of data must often be calculated or inferred by the code itself. Errors in deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor to improper input validation. \n\nNote that \"input validation\" has very different meanings to different people, or within different classification schemes. Caution must be used when referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it. For example, some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control to an attacker over an input when they should not be able to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred to as input validation.\n\n\nFinally, it is important to emphasize that the distinctions between input validation and output escaping are often blurred, and developers must be careful to understand the difference, including how input validation is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, this valid name cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\nPeerOf -> CWE-345\nCanPrecede -> CWE-22\nCanPrecede -> CWE-41\nCanPrecede -> CWE-74\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-770\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis. It is also a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Consider lower-level children such as Improper Use of Validation Framework (CWE-1173) or improper validation involving specific types or properties of input such as Specified Quantity (CWE-1284); Specified Index, Position, or Offset (CWE-1285); Syntactic Correctness (CWE-1286); Specified Type (CWE-1287); Consistency within Input (CWE-1288); or Unsafe Equivalence (CWE-1289).\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-1284: Specified Quantity\n- CWE-1285: Specified Index, Position, or Offset\n- CWE-1286: Syntactic Correctness\n- CWE-1287: Specified Type\n- CWE-1288: Consistency within Input\n- CWE-1289: Unsafe Equivalence\n- CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nCWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.\n\n\n**[Maintenance]** As of 2020, this entry is used more often than preferred, and it is a source of frequent confusion. It is being actively modified for CWE 4.1 and subsequent versions.\n\n**[Maintenance]** Concepts such as validation, data transformation, and neutralization are being refined, so relationships between CWE-20 and other entries such as CWE-707 may change in future versions, along with an update to the Vulnerability Theory document.\n\n**[Maintenance]** Input validation - whether missing or incorrect - is such an essential and widespread part of secure development that it is implicit in many different weaknesses. Traditionally, problems such as buffer overflows and XSS have been classified as input validation problems by many security professionals. However, input validation is not necessarily the only protection mechanism available for avoiding such problems, and in some cases it is not even sufficient. The CWE team has begun capturing these subtleties in chains within the Research Concepts view (CWE-1000), but more work is needed.\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nThe \"input validation\" term is extremely common, but it is used in many different ways. In some cases its usage can obscure the real underlying weakness or otherwise hide chaining and composite relationships.\n\n\nSome people use \"input validation\" as a general term that covers many different neutralization techniques for ensuring that input is appropriate, such as filtering, canonicalization, and escaping. Others use the term in a more narrow context to simply mean \"checking if an input conforms to expectations without changing it.\" CWE uses this more narrow interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n- **CVE-2021-30860:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) leads to integer overflow (CWE-190) in mobile OS, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-284: Improper Access Control\n**Abstraction:** Pillar\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAccess control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:\n\n\n  - Authentication (proving the identity of an actor)\n\n  - Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and\n\n  - Accountability (tracking of activities that were performed)\n\nWhen any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.\n\nThere are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:\n\n\n  - Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.\n\n  - Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthorization: The terms \"access control\" and \"authorization\" are often used interchangeably, although many people have distinct definitions. The CWE usage of \"access control\" is intended as a general term for the various mechanisms that restrict which users can access which resources, and \"authorization\" is more narrowly defined. It is unlikely that there will be community consensus on the use of these terms.\n\n### Relationships\nNone\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-284 is extremely high-level, a Pillar. Its name, \"Improper Access Control,\" is often misused in low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287] or by active use of the OWASP Top Ten, such as \"A01:2021-Broken Access Control\". It is not useful for trend analysis.\n**Comments:** Consider using descendants of CWE-284 that are more specific to the kind of access control involved, such as those involving authorization (Missing Authorization (CWE-862), Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863), Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource (CWE-732), etc.); authentication (Missing Authentication (CWE-306) or Weak Authentication (CWE-1390)); Incorrect User Management (CWE-286); Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints (CWE-923); etc.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n- Abstraction\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n- CWE-306: Missing Authentication\n- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n- CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** \n\nThis entry needs more work. Possible sub-categories include:\n\n\n  - Trusted group includes undesired entities (partially covered by CWE-286)\n\n  - Group can perform undesired actions\n\n  - ACL parse error does not fail closed\n\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-24985:** A form hosting website only checks the session authentication status for a single form, making it possible to bypass authentication when there are multiple forms\n- **CVE-2022-29238:** Access-control setting in web-based document collaboration tool is not properly implemented by the code, which prevents listing hidden directories but does not prevent direct requests to files in those directories.\n- **CVE-2022-23607:** Python-based HTTP library did not scope cookies to a particular domain such that \"supercookies\" could be sent to any domain on redirect\n\n"
