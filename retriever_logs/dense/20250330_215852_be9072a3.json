This allows attackers to craft malicious file paths that escape the intended directory, resulting in path traversal.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** By manipulating the `filename` parameter in the `send_file` function, attackers can access arbitrary files and directories on the server's filesystem. This is typically done using sequences like `../` or using absolute file paths.\n- **Unsanitized User Input:** The applications do not properly sanitize user input before passing it to the `send_file` function, making them susceptible to path traversal attacks.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can access sensitive files, including source code, configuration files, and other critical system files.\n- **Limited Availability Impact:** In some cases, the vulnerability also has a low availability impact, potentially by allowing an attacker to make multiple requests for large files to cause a partial denial of service.\n- **No Integrity Impact:** The provided descriptions generally do not mention data modification, indicating that integrity is not directly impacted.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Network-Based Attacks:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network, meaning an attacker can trigger it remotely without needing direct access to the server or any specific user interaction.\n- **Malicious Filename Parameters:** Attackers send crafted requests including malicious values in the `filename` parameter which are then unsafely used by the `send_file` function.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n-   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any privileges or authentication on the system to exploit the vulnerability.\n-   **Remote Access:** The attacker can trigger the vulnerability through network requests, therefore the attacker doesn't need physical access to the machine.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- **Affected Function:** The vulnerable function is always `flask.send_file`, when it is directly used with user-provided `filename` input.\n- **Vulnerable Repositories:** The content provides numerous affected repositories, all demonstrating a similar vulnerability pattern involving the unsafe usage of the `flask.send_file` function.\n- **Mitigation Recommendations:**\n    - **Input Sanitization:** Use `flask.safe_join` to properly sanitize user-provided file paths.\n    - **Alternative Functions:** Use `flask.send_from_directory` instead of `send_file` when serving files from a directory, as it includes safeguards against path traversal.\n\n**CVE Specifics:**\n\nHere are some of the CVEs mentioned, which all exhibit the same core vulnerability:\n\n*   **CVE-2022-31504:** `ChangeWeDer/BaiduWenkuSpider_flaskWeb`\n*   **CVE-2022-31505:** `cheo0/MercadoEnLineaBack`\n*   **CVE-2022-31509:** `iedadata/usap-dc-website`\n*   **CVE-2022-31510:** `sergeKashkin/Simple-RAT`\n*   **CVE-2022-31511:** `AFDudley/equanimity`\n*   **CVE-2022-31512:** `Atom02/flask-mvc`\n*  **CVE-2022-31513**: `BolunHan/Krypton`\n*   **CVE-2022-31514:** `Caoyongqi912/Fan_Platform`\n*   **CVE-2022-31515:** `Delor4/CarceresBE`\n*   **CVE-2022-31516:** `Harveyzyh/Python`\n*   **CVE-2022-31518:** `JustAnotherSoftwareDeveloper/Python-Recipe-Database`\n*   **CVE-2022-31520:** `Luxas98/logstash-management-api`\n*   **CVE-2022-31521:** `Niyaz-Mohamed/Mosaic`\n*   **CVE-2022-31526:** `ThundeRatz/ThunderDocs`\n*   **CVE-2022-31527:** `Wildog/flask-file-server`\n*   **CVE-2022-31528:** `bonn-activity-maps/bam_annotation_tool`\n*   **CVE-2022-31532:** `dankolbman/travel_blahg`\n*   **CVE-2022-31533:** `decentraminds/umbral`\n*   **CVE-2022-31534:** `echoleegroup/PythonWeb`\n*   **CVE-2022-31535:** `freefood89/Fishtank`\n*   **CVE-2022-31536:** `jaygarza1982/ytdl-sync`\n*   **CVE-2022-31537:** `jmcginty15/Solar-system-simulator`\n*   **CVE-2022-31538:** `joaopedro-fg/mp-m08-interface`\n*   **CVE-2022-31540:** `kumardeepak/hin-eng-preprocessing`\n*  **CVE-2022-31544**: `meerstein/rbtm`\n*   **CVE-2022-31545:** `ml-inory/ModelConverter`\n*   **CVE-2022-31546:** `nlpweb/glance`\n*   **CVE-2022-31547:** `noamezekiel/sphere`\n*   **CVE-2022-31548:** `nrlakin/homepage`\n*   **CVE-2022-31551:** `pleomax00/flask-mongo-skel`\n*   **CVE-2022-31552:** `project-anuvaad/anuvaad-corpus`\n*  **CVE-2022-31553**: `rainsoupah/sleep-learner`\n*   **CVE-2022-31554:** `rohitnayak/movie-review-sentiment-analysis`\n*   **CVE-2022-31555:** `romain20100/nursequest`\n*   **CVE-2022-31556:** `rusyasoft/TrainEnergyServer`\n*   **CVE-2022-31557:** `seveas/golem`\n*   **CVE-2022-31559:** `tsileo/flask-yeoman`\n*   **CVE-2022-31560:** `uncleYiba/photo_tag`\n*  **CVE-2022-31561**: `varijkapil13/Sphere_ImageBackend`\n*   **CVE-2022-31562:** `waveyan/internshipsystem`\n*   **CVE-2022-31563:** `whmacmac/vprj`\n*   **CVE-2022-31564:** `woduq1414/munhak-moa`\n*   **CVE-2022-31565:** `yogson/syrabond`\n*   **CVE-2022-31566:** `DSAB-local/DSAB`\n*   **CVE-2022-31567:** `DSABenchmark/DSAB`\n*   **CVE-2022-31568:** `Rexians/rex-web`\n*   **CVE-2022-31570:** `adriankoczuruek/ceneo-web-scrapper`\n*   **CVE-2022-31571:** `akashtalole/python-flask-restful-api`\n*   **CVE-2022-31572:** `ceee-vip/cockybook`\n*   **CVE-2022-31574:** `deepaliupadhyay/RealEstate`\n*   **CVE-2022-31575:** `duducosmos/livro_python`\n*  **CVE-2022-31576**: `heidi-luong1109/shackerpanel`\n*   **CVE-2022-31577:** `longmaoteamtf/audio_aligner_app`\n*   **CVE-2022-31578:** `piaoyunsoft/bt_lnmp`\n*   **CVE-2022-31579:** `ralphjzhang/iasset`\n*   **CVE-2022-31582:** `shaolo1/VideoServer`\n*   **CVE-2022-31583:** `sravaniboinepelli/AutomatedQuizEval`\n*   **CVE-2022-31585:** `umeshpatil-dev/Home__internet`\n*   **CVE-2022-31587:** `yuriyouzhou/KG-fashion-chatbot`\n*   **CVE-2022-31588:** `zippies/testplatform`\n\nThis information provides a clear picture of the vulnerability and its scope across the projects listed.

By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDirectory traversal\nPath traversal: \"Path traversal\" is preferred over \"directory traversal,\" but both terms are attack-focused.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add \".txt\" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.\n\n**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.\n\n**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing \"/\" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nLike other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use \"directory traversal\" only to refer to the injection of \"..\" and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.\n\n\nOther variants like \"absolute pathname\" and \"drive letter\" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve \"..\" or equivalent.\n\n\n**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.\n\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nIncomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that \"..\\\" is vulnerable, but not test \"../\" which may also be vulnerable.\n\n\nAny combination of directory separators (\"/\", \"\\\", etc.) and numbers of \".\" (e.g. \"....\") can produce unique variants; for example, the \"//../\" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama\n- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the \"\\\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as \"/abs/path\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-22\nChildOf -> CWE-22\nChildOf -> CWE-22\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.\n\t\t2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.\n```\nFor example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-642\nChildOf -> CWE-610\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-22\nCanPrecede -> CWE-41\nCanPrecede -> CWE-98\nCanPrecede -> CWE-434\nCanPrecede -> CWE-59\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** CWE-114 is a Class, but it is listed a child of CWE-73 in view 1000. This suggests some abstraction problems that should be resolved in future versions.\n\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThe external control of filenames can be the primary link in chains with other file-related weaknesses, as seen in the CanPrecede relationships. This is because software systems use files for many different purposes: to execute programs, load code libraries, to store application data, to store configuration settings, record temporary data, act as signals or semaphores to other processes, etc.\n\n\nHowever, those weaknesses do not always require external control. For example, link-following weaknesses (CWE-59) often involve pathnames that are not controllable by the attacker at all.\n\n\nThe external control can be resultant from other issues. For example, in PHP applications, the register_globals setting can allow an attacker to modify variables that the programmer thought were immutable, enabling file inclusion (CWE-98) and path traversal (CWE-22). Operating with excessive privileges (CWE-250) might allow an attacker to specify an input filename that is not directly readable by the attacker, but is accessible to the privileged program. A buffer overflow (CWE-119) might give an attacker control over nearby memory locations that are related to pathnames, but were not directly modifiable by the attacker.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n- **CVE-2008-5748:** Chain: external control of values for user's desired language and theme enables path traversal.\n- **CVE-2008-5764:** Chain: external control of user's target language enables remote file inclusion.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nZip Slip: \"Zip slip\" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282]. It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-22\nChildOf -> CWE-22\nChildOf -> CWE-22\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

    "base_query": "## Vulnerability Description\nThe cheo0/MercadoEnLineaBack repository through 2022-05-04 on GitHub allows **absolute path traversal** because the Flask send_file function is used unsafely.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **weakness:** **absolute path traversal**\n- **product:** cleo0/MercadoEnLineaBack\n- **version:** through 2022-05-04\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to path traversal (CWE-22) in Flask applications using `send_file` unsafely, as described in multiple CVEs.\n\n**Common Root Cause:**\n\n- **Unsafe Use of Flask's `send_file` Function:** The primary cause of these vulnerabilities across multiple repositories is the direct use of Flask's `send_file` function with user-controlled input for the filename parameter. This allows attackers to craft malicious file paths that escape the intended directory, resulting in path traversal.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** By manipulating the `filename` parameter in the `send_file` function, attackers can access arbitrary files and directories on the server's filesystem. This is typically done using sequences like `../` or using absolute file paths.\n- **Unsanitized User Input:** The applications do not properly sanitize user input before passing it to the `send_file` function, making them susceptible to path traversal attacks.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can access sensitive files, including source code, configuration files, and other critical system files.\n- **Limited Availability Impact:** In some cases, the vulnerability also has a low availability impact, potentially by allowing an attacker to make multiple requests for large files to cause a partial denial of service.\n- **No Integrity Impact:** The provided descriptions generally do not mention data modification, indicating that integrity is not directly impacted.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Network-Based Attacks:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network, meaning an attacker can trigger it remotely without needing direct access to the server or any specific user interaction.\n- **Malicious Filename Parameters:** Attackers send crafted requests including malicious values in the `filename` parameter which are then unsafely used by the `send_file` function.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n-   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any privileges or authentication on the system to exploit the vulnerability.\n-   **Remote Access:** The attacker can trigger the vulnerability through network requests, therefore the attacker doesn't need physical access to the machine.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- **Affected Function:** The vulnerable function is always `flask.send_file`, when it is directly used with user-provided `filename` input.\n- **Vulnerable Repositories:** The content provides numerous affected repositories, all demonstrating a similar vulnerability pattern involving the unsafe usage of the `flask.send_file` function.\n- **Mitigation Recommendations:**\n    - **Input Sanitization:** Use `flask.safe_join` to properly sanitize user-provided file paths.\n    - **Alternative Functions:** Use `flask.send_from_directory` instead of `send_file` when serving files from a directory, as it includes safeguards against path traversal.\n\n**CVE Specifics:**\n\nHere are some of the CVEs mentioned, which all exhibit the same core vulnerability:\n\n*   **CVE-2022-31504:** `ChangeWeDer/BaiduWenkuSpider_flaskWeb`\n*   **CVE-2022-31505:** `cheo0/MercadoEnLineaBack`\n*   **CVE-2022-31509:** `iedadata/usap-dc-website`\n*   **CVE-2022-31510:** `sergeKashkin/Simple-RAT`\n*   **CVE-2022-31511:** `AFDudley/equanimity`\n*   **CVE-2022-31512:** `Atom02/flask-mvc`\n*  **CVE-2022-31513**: `BolunHan/Krypton`\n*   **CVE-2022-31514:** `Caoyongqi912/Fan_Platform`\n*   **CVE-2022-31515:** `Delor4/CarceresBE`\n*   **CVE-2022-31516:** `Harveyzyh/Python`\n*   **CVE-2022-31518:** `JustAnotherSoftwareDeveloper/Python-Recipe-Database`\n*   **CVE-2022-31520:** `Luxas98/logstash-management-api`\n*   **CVE-2022-31521:** `Niyaz-Mohamed/Mosaic`\n*   **CVE-2022-31526:** `ThundeRatz/ThunderDocs`\n*   **CVE-2022-31527:** `Wildog/flask-file-server`\n*   **CVE-2022-31528:** `bonn-activity-maps/bam_annotation_tool`\n*   **CVE-2022-31532:** `dankolbman/travel_blahg`\n*   **CVE-2022-31533:** `decentraminds/umbral`\n*   **CVE-2022-31534:** `echoleegroup/PythonWeb`\n*   **CVE-2022-31535:** `freefood89/Fishtank`\n*   **CVE-2022-31536:** `jaygarza1982/ytdl-sync`\n*   **CVE-2022-31537:** `jmcginty15/Solar-system-simulator`\n*   **CVE-2022-31538:** `joaopedro-fg/mp-m08-interface`\n*   **CVE-2022-31540:** `kumardeepak/hin-eng-preprocessing`\n*  **CVE-2022-31544**: `meerstein/rbtm`\n*   **CVE-2022-31545:** `ml-inory/ModelConverter`\n*   **CVE-2022-31546:** `nlpweb/glance`\n*   **CVE-2022-31547:** `noamezekiel/sphere`\n*   **CVE-2022-31548:** `nrlakin/homepage`\n*   **CVE-2022-31551:** `pleomax00/flask-mongo-skel`\n*   **CVE-2022-31552:** `project-anuvaad/anuvaad-corpus`\n*  **CVE-2022-31553**: `rainsoupah/sleep-learner`\n*   **CVE-2022-31554:** `rohitnayak/movie-review-sentiment-analysis`\n*   **CVE-2022-31555:** `romain20100/nursequest`\n*   **CVE-2022-31556:** `rusyasoft/TrainEnergyServer`\n*   **CVE-2022-31557:** `seveas/golem`\n*   **CVE-2022-31559:** `tsileo/flask-yeoman`\n*   **CVE-2022-31560:** `uncleYiba/photo_tag`\n*  **CVE-2022-31561**: `varijkapil13/Sphere_ImageBackend`\n*   **CVE-2022-31562:** `waveyan/internshipsystem`\n*   **CVE-2022-31563:** `whmacmac/vprj`\n*   **CVE-2022-31564:** `woduq1414/munhak-moa`\n*   **CVE-2022-31565:** `yogson/syrabond`\n*   **CVE-2022-31566:** `DSAB-local/DSAB`\n*   **CVE-2022-31567:** `DSABenchmark/DSAB`\n*   **CVE-2022-31568:** `Rexians/rex-web`\n*   **CVE-2022-31570:** `adriankoczuruek/ceneo-web-scrapper`\n*   **CVE-2022-31571:** `akashtalole/python-flask-restful-api`\n*   **CVE-2022-31572:** `ceee-vip/cockybook`\n*   **CVE-2022-31574:** `deepaliupadhyay/RealEstate`\n*   **CVE-2022-31575:** `duducosmos/livro_python`\n*  **CVE-2022-31576**: `heidi-luong1109/shackerpanel`\n*   **CVE-2022-31577:** `longmaoteamtf/audio_aligner_app`\n*   **CVE-2022-31578:** `piaoyunsoft/bt_lnmp`\n*   **CVE-2022-31579:** `ralphjzhang/iasset`\n*   **CVE-2022-31582:** `shaolo1/VideoServer`\n*   **CVE-2022-31583:** `sravaniboinepelli/AutomatedQuizEval`\n*   **CVE-2022-31585:** `umeshpatil-dev/Home__internet`\n*   **CVE-2022-31587:** `yuriyouzhou/KG-fashion-chatbot`\n*   **CVE-2022-31588:** `zippies/testplatform`\n\nThis information provides a clear picture of the vulnerability and its scope across the projects listed.

By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDirectory traversal\nPath traversal: \"Path traversal\" is preferred over \"directory traversal,\" but both terms are attack-focused.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add \".txt\" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.\n\n**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.\n\n**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing \"/\" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nLike other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use \"directory traversal\" only to refer to the injection of \"..\" and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.\n\n\nOther variants like \"absolute pathname\" and \"drive letter\" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve \"..\" or equivalent.\n\n\n**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.\n\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nIncomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that \"..\\\" is vulnerable, but not test \"../\" which may also be vulnerable.\n\n\nAny combination of directory separators (\"/\", \"\\\", etc.) and numbers of \".\" (e.g. \"....\") can produce unique variants; for example, the \"//../\" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a.

An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.\n\t\t2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.\n```\nFor example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-642\nChildOf -> CWE-610\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-22\nCanPrecede -> CWE-41\nCanPrecede -> CWE-98\nCanPrecede -> CWE-434\nCanPrecede -> CWE-59\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This suggests some abstraction problems that should be resolved in future versions.\n\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThe external control of filenames can be the primary link in chains with other file-related weaknesses, as seen in the CanPrecede relationships. This is because software systems use files for many different purposes: to execute programs, load code libraries, to store application data, to store configuration settings, record temporary data, act as signals or semaphores to other processes, etc.\n\n\nHowever, those weaknesses do not always require external control. For example, link-following weaknesses (CWE-59) often involve pathnames that are not controllable by the attacker at all.\n\n\nThe external control can be resultant from other issues. For example, in PHP applications, the register_globals setting can allow an attacker to modify variables that the programmer thought were immutable, enabling file inclusion (CWE-98) and path traversal (CWE-22). Operating with excessive privileges (CWE-250) might allow an attacker to specify an input filename that is not directly readable by the attacker, but is accessible to the privileged program. A buffer overflow (CWE-119) might give an attacker control over nearby memory locations that are related to pathnames, but were not directly modifiable by the attacker.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n- **CVE-2008-5748:** Chain: external control of values for user's desired language and theme enables path traversal.\n- **CVE-2008-5764:** Chain: external control of user's target language enables remote file inclusion.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nZip Slip: \"Zip slip\" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282].

They are the combination of multiple elements: file or directory permissions, filename predictability, race conditions, and in some cases, a design limitation in which there is no mechanism for performing atomic file creation operations.\n\n\nSome potential factors are race conditions, permissions, and predictability.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-1386:** Some versions of Perl follow symbolic links when running with the -e option, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.\n- **CVE-2000-1178:** Text editor follows symbolic links when creating a rescue copy during an abnormal exit, which allows local users to overwrite the files of other users.\n- **CVE-2004-0217:** Antivirus update allows local users to create or append to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a logfile.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-38: Path Traversal: '\\absolute\\pathname\\here'\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product accepts input in the form of a backslash absolute path ('\\absolute\\pathname\\here') without appropriate validation, which can allow an attacker to traverse the file system to unintended locations or access arbitrary files.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-36\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-1263:** Mail client allows remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary files via an e-mail message containing a uuencoded attachment that specifies the full pathname for the file to be modified.\n- **CVE-2003-0753:** Remote attackers can read arbitrary files via a full pathname to the target file in config parameter.\n- **CVE-2002-1525:** Remote attackers can read arbitrary files via an absolute pathname.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-39: Path Traversal: 'C:dirname'\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product accepts input that contains a drive letter or Windows volume letter ('C:dirname') that potentially redirects access to an unintended location or arbitrary file.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-36\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-0038:** Remote attackers can read arbitrary files by specifying the drive letter in the requested URL.\n- **CVE-2001-0255:** FTP server allows remote attackers to list arbitrary directories by using the \"ls\" command and including the drive letter name (e.g. C:) in the requested pathname.\n- **CVE-2001-0687:** FTP server allows a remote attacker to retrieve privileged system information by specifying arbitrary paths.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-182: Collapse of Data into Unsafe Value\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product filters data in a way that causes it to be reduced or \"collapsed\" into an unsafe value that violates an expected security property.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-693\nCanPrecede -> CWE-33\nCanPrecede -> CWE-34\nCanPrecede -> CWE-35\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
