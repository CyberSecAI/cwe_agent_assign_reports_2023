  "query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. An attacker can craft a TFLite model that would cause an **integer overflow** in embedding lookup operations. Both `embedding_size` and `lookup_size` are products of values provided by the user. Hence, a malicious user could trigger overflows in the multiplication. In certain scenarios, this can then result in **heap OOB read/write**. Users are advised to upgrade to a patched version.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## WEAKNESS: 'integer overflow'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 511.86)\n\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.

CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types (Score: 441.13)\n\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values. If the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur....\n\n### 4.
