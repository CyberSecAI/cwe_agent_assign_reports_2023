Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, certain TFLite models that were created using TFLite model converter would crash when loaded in the TFLite interpreter. The culprit is that during quantization the scale of values could be greater than 1 but code was always assuming sub-unit scaling. Thus, since code was calling `QuantizeMultiplierSmallerThanOneExp`, the `TFLITE_CHECK_LT` assertion would trigger and abort the process. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **code was always assuming sub-unit scaling but scale of values could be greater than 1 during quantization**\n- **impact:** crash\n- **product:** TensorFlow\n- **version:** Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4\n- **component:** TFLite\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-29212:\n\n**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**\n\nThe provided text directly mentions CVE-2022-29212:\n\n> *   Fixes a core dump when loading TFLite models with quantization ([CVE-2022-29212](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-29212))\n\nThis confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.\n\n**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe core dump was caused by an incorrect assumption in the code regarding the scaling of values during quantization in TFLite models. Specifically:\n*   The code assumed that the scale of values would always be less than 1 (sub-unit scaling)\n*   However, certain TFLite models created with the TFLite model converter could have scales greater than 1.\n*   This caused the `QuantizeMultiplierSmallerThanOneExp` function to fail due to a `TFLITE_CHECK_LT` assertion failure, resulting in a core dump.\n\n**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\nThe core vulnerability was a **missing validation** or **incorrect assumption** within the TFLite interpreter's quantization handling logic. The `QuantizeMultiplierSmallerThanOneExp` function was inappropriately called when the scale factor was not less than 1 and did not account for cases where the scale was greater than 1.\n\n**4. Impact of Exploitation:**\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability is a **core dump** (crash) when loading specific TFLite models that used quantization, leading to a denial of service.\n\n**5. Attack Vectors:**\n\nThe attack vector involves loading a specially crafted or generated TFLite model that triggers the faulty quantization logic, which is created via the TFLite model converter.\n\n**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs the ability to create a TFLite model with specific quantization parameters. This could be achieved using the TFLite model converter, potentially with manipulated or crafted input parameters or models.\n*   The attacker also needs to be able to load the malicious model via the TensorFlow Lite interpreter.\n\n**Additional Information from the provided text:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was reported via a GitHub issue ([#43661](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/43661)).\n*   The fix was implemented in commit [a989426ee1346693cc015792f11d715f6944f2b8](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a989426ee1346693cc015792f11d715f6944f2b8).\n*   The fix was included in TensorFlow versions 2.6.4, 2.7.2, 2.8.1, and 2.9.0.\n*   The fix involves modifying the `QuantizeMultiplier` function to handle scale factors greater than 1 appropriately.\n* The fix changed the function to call  `QuantizeMultiplierSmallerThanOneExp` only when the multiplier is less than 1, otherwise, `QuantizeMultiplierGreaterThanOne` is called.\n*   The vulnerability is classified as \"Low\" severity by the advisory.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nCVE-2022-29212 is a vulnerability in TensorFlow Lite that could lead to a denial-of-service crash. It occurs because of an incorrect assumption during the handling of quantized models where scale factors are not less than one. This vulnerability is triggered by loading a specially crafted TFLite model by an attacker. The vulnerability has been patched in multiple versions of Tensorflow.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.635 |\n| 2 | 617 | Reachable Assertion | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.537 |\n| 3 | 835 | Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.533 |\n| 4 | 122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.497 |\n| 5 | 674 | Uncontrolled Recursion | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.484 |\n| 6 | 1287 | Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.437 |\n| 7 | 123 | Write-what-where Condition | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 125 | Out-of-bounds Read | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.482 |\n| 9 | 190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.479 |\n| 10 | 95 | Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection') | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.479 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nSpecified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others.

Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called \"underflows\").\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\n\"Integer overflow\" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.\n\n\nA \"wraparound\" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.\n\n\n\"Overflow\" is sometimes conflated with \"wraparound\" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.\n\n\nThe \"overflow\" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use \"overflow\" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using \"underflow\" for exceeding the minimum.\n\n\nSome people use \"overflow\" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses \"underflow\" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.\n\n\nSee [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.\n\n\n**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190).
