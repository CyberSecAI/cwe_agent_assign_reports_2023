The device's web interface can be circumvented using a specific credential string, allowing unauthorized access.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the improper implementation of authentication, allowing attackers to bypass normal authentication procedures. This is identified as CWE-287 (Improper Authentication).\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication and perform administrative operations. This could lead to complete compromise of the device, including reading sensitive data, modifying configurations, and disrupting device functionality.\n*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, exploiting the device\u2019s web interface.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the device and knowledge of the specific credential string to bypass authentication. The attack complexity is considered low and does not require any prior privileges.\n\n**Additional details:**\n*   The vulnerability affects all versions of Exemys RME1-AI firmware prior to and including 2.1.6.\n*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8, with a vector string of AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating high impact.\n*   The advisory indicates that the affected product, RME1, is end-of-life and no longer supported by the vendor, with a recommendation to upgrade to the RME2.\n*   The advisory recommends defensive measures, such as minimizing network exposure, using firewalls and VPNs (while acknowledging their vulnerabilities) and keeping systems updated.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 1392 | Use of Default Credentials | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.189 |\n| 2 | 287 | Improper Authentication | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.178 |\n| 3 | 522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.175 |\n| 4 | 1188 | Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.169 |\n| 5 | 784 | Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.166 |\n| 6 | 289 | Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.562 |\n| 7 | 178 | Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 269 | Improper Privilege Management | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.165 |\n| 9 | 306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.163 |\n| 10 | 285 | Improper Authorization | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.162 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses default credentials (such as passwords or cryptographic keys) for potentially critical functionality.\n\n### Extended Description\nIt is common practice for products to be designed to use default keys, passwords, or other mechanisms for authentication. The rationale is to simplify the manufacturing process or the system administrator's task of installation and deployment into an enterprise. However, if admins do not change the defaults, it is easier for attackers to bypass authentication quickly across multiple organizations.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1391\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30270:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses default credentials for some SSH accounts\n- **CVE-2021-41192:** data visualization/sharing package uses default secret keys or cookie values if they are not specified in environment variables\n- **CVE-2021-38759:** microcontroller board has default password\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-287: Improper Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nWhen an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nauthentification: An alternate term is \"authentification\", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.\nAuthN: \"AuthN\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authentication\" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from \"AuthZ,\" which is an abbreviation of \"authorization.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\nAuthC: \"AuthC\" is used as an abbreviation of \"authentication,\" but it appears to used less frequently than \"AuthN.\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication\n- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.\n- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30018:** A messaging platform serializes all elements of User/Group objects, making private information available to adversaries\n- **CVE-2022-29959:** Initialization file contains credentials that can be decoded using a \"simple string transformation\"\n- **CVE-2022-35411:** Python-based RPC framework enables pickle functionality by default, allowing clients to unpickle untrusted data.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nDevelopers often choose default values that leave the product as open and easy to use as possible out-of-the-box, under the assumption that the administrator can (or should) change the default value. However, this ease-of-use comes at a cost when the default is insecure and the administrator does not change it.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1419\nChildOf -> CWE-665\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry improves organization of concepts under initialization. The typical CWE model is to cover \"Missing\" and \"Incorrect\" behaviors. Arguably, this entry could be named as \"Incorrect\" instead of \"Insecure.\" This might be changed in the near future.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-36349:** insecure default variable initialization in BIOS firmware for a hardware board allows DoS\n- **CVE-2022-42467:** A generic database browser interface has a default mode that exposes a web server to the network, allowing queries to the database.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-784: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of a cookie, but it does not properly ensure that the cookie is valid for the associated user.\n\n### Extended Description\nAttackers can easily modify cookies, within the browser or by implementing the client-side code outside of the browser. Attackers can bypass protection mechanisms such as authorization and authentication by modifying the cookie to contain an expected value.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-807\nChildOf -> CWE-565\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** A new parent might need to be defined for this entry. This entry is specific to cookies, which reflects the significant number of vulnerabilities being reported for cookie-based authentication in CVE during 2008 and 2009. However, other types of inputs - such as parameters or headers - could also be used for similar authentication or authorization. Similar issues (under the Research view) include CWE-247 and CWE-472.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2009-1549:** Attacker can bypass authentication by setting a cookie to a specific value.\n- **CVE-2009-1619:** Attacker can bypass authentication and gain admin privileges by setting an \"admin\" cookie to 1.\n- **CVE-2009-0864:** Content management system allows admin privileges by setting a \"login\" cookie to \"OK.\"\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs authentication based on the name of a resource being accessed, or the name of the actor performing the access, but it does not properly check all possible names for that resource or actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Overlaps equivalent encodings, canonicalization, authorization, multiple trailing slash, trailing space, mixed case, and other equivalence issues.\n\n**[Theoretical]** Alternate names are useful in data driven manipulation attacks, not just for authentication.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2003-0317:** Protection mechanism that restricts URL access can be bypassed using URL encoding.\n- **CVE-2004-0847:** Bypass of authentication for files using \"\\\" (backslash) or \"%5C\" (encoded backslash).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-178: Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly account for differences in case sensitivity when accessing or determining the properties of a resource, leading to inconsistent results.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nImproperly handled case sensitive data can lead to several possible consequences, including:\n\n\n  - case-insensitive passwords reducing the size of the key space, making brute force attacks easier\n\n  - bypassing filters or access controls using alternate names\n\n  - multiple interpretation errors using alternate names.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nCanPrecede -> CWE-433\nCanPrecede -> CWE-289\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Research Gap]** These are probably under-studied in Windows and Mac environments, where file names are case-insensitive and thus are subject to equivalence manipulations involving case.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2000-0499:** Application server allows attackers to bypass execution of a jsp page and read the source code using an upper case JSP extension in the request.\n- **CVE-2000-0497:** The server is case sensitive, so filetype handlers treat .jsp and .JSP as different extensions. JSP source code may be read because .JSP defaults to the filetype \"text\".\n- **CVE-2000-0498:** The server is case sensitive, so filetype handlers treat .jsp and .JSP as different extensions. JSP source code may be read because .JSP defaults to the filetype \"text\".\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-269 is commonly misused. It can be conflated with \"privilege escalation,\" which is a technical impact that is listed in many low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis.\n**Comments:** If an error or mistake allows privilege escalation, then use the CWE ID for that mistake. Avoid using CWE-269 when only phrases such as \"privilege escalation\" or \"gain privileges\" are available, as these indicate technical impact of the vulnerability - not the root cause weakness. If the root cause seems to be directly related to privileges, then examine the children of CWE-269 for additional hints, such as Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250) or Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266).\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-1555:** Terminal privileges are not reset when a user logs out.\n- **CVE-2001-1514:** Does not properly pass security context to child processes in certain cases, allows privilege escalation.\n- **CVE-2001-0128:** Does not properly compute roles.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-31260:** Chain: a digital asset management program has an undisclosed backdoor in the legacy version of a PHP script (CWE-912) that could allow an unauthenticated user to export metadata (CWE-306)\n- **CVE-2022-29951:** TCP-based protocol in Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) has no authentication.\n- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\nWhen access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information\n- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.\n- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.\n\n",
