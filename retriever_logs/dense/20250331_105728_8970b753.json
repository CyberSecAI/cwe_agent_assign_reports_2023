CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (Score: 171.05)\n\nThe product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol....\n\n### 2. CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength (Score: 165.22)\n\nThe product stores or transmits sensitive data using an encryption scheme that is theoretically sound, but is not strong enough for the level of protection required....\n\n### 3. CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort (Score: 160.00)\n\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive....\n\n### 4. CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials (Score: 155.11)\n\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker....\n\n### 5. CWE-261: Weak Encoding for Password (Score: 150.46)\n\nObscuring a password with a trivial encoding does not protect the password....\n\n## WEAKNESS: 'insecure method of storage'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1.
