This can allow untrusted applications to obtain sensitive data. There are two variations on the standard broadcast intent, ordered and sticky.\n\n\nOrdered broadcast intents are delivered to a series of registered receivers in order of priority as declared by the Receivers. A malicious receiver can give itself a high priority and cause a denial of service by stopping the broadcast from propagating further down the chain. There is also the possibility of malicious data modification, as a receiver may also alter the data within the Intent before passing it on to the next receiver. The downstream components have no way of asserting that the data has not been altered earlier in the chain.\n\n\nSticky broadcast intents remain accessible after the initial broadcast. An old sticky intent will be broadcast again to any new receivers that register for it in the future, greatly increasing the chances of information exposure over time. Also, sticky broadcasts cannot be protected by permissions that may apply to other kinds of intents.\n\n\nIn addition, any broadcast intent may include a URI that references data that the receiving component does not normally have the privileges to access. The sender of the intent can include special privileges that grant the receiver read or write access to the specific URI included in the intent. A malicious receiver that intercepts this intent will also gain those privileges and be able to read or write the resource at the specified URI.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-4903:** An Android application does not use FLAG_IMMUTABLE when creating a PendingIntent.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-925: Improper Verification of Intent by Broadcast Receiver\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe Android application uses a Broadcast Receiver that receives an Intent but does not properly verify that the Intent came from an authorized source.\n\n### Extended Description\nCertain types of Intents, identified by action string, can only be broadcast by the operating system itself, not by third-party applications. However, when an application registers to receive these implicit system intents, it is also registered to receive any explicit intents. While a malicious application cannot send an implicit system intent, it can send an explicit intent to the target application, which may assume that any received intent is a valid implicit system intent and not an explicit intent from another application. This may lead to unintended behavior.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nIntent Spoofing\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-940\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry will be made more comprehensive in later CWE versions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not initialize a critical resource.\n\n### Extended Description\nMany resources require initialization before they can be properly used. If a resource is not initialized, it could contain unpredictable or expired data, or it could be initialized to defaults that are invalid. This can have security implications when the resource is expected to have certain properties or values.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nCanPrecede -> CWE-908\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-20739:** A variable that has its value set in a conditional statement is sometimes used when the conditional fails, sometimes causing data leakage\n- **CVE-2005-1036:** Chain: Bypass of access restrictions due to improper authorization (CWE-862) of a user results from an improperly initialized (CWE-909) I/O permission bitmap\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which \"permissions\" are not checked, which is an \"authorization\" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].\n**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n- **CVE-2009-3482:** Anti-virus product sets insecure \"Everyone: Full Control\" permissions for files under the \"Program Files\" folder, allowing attackers to replace executables with Trojan horses.\n- **CVE-2009-3897:** Product creates directories with 0777 permissions at installation, allowing users to gain privileges and access a socket used for authentication.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nA race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.\n\n\nA race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:\n\n\n  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.\n\n  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.\n\nA race condition exists when an \"interfering code sequence\" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.\n\nThe interfering code sequence could be \"trusted\" or \"untrusted.\" A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nRace Condition\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-691\nCanPrecede -> CWE-416\nCanPrecede -> CWE-476\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed. They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.\n\n**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nCode frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-400\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nChildOf -> CWE-400\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).\n\n**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. \"Resource exhaustion\" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..\n- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.\n\n",

An old sticky intent will be broadcast again to any new receivers that register for it in the future, greatly increasing the chances of information exposure over time. Also, sticky broadcasts cannot be protected by permissions that may apply to other kinds of intents.\n\n\nIn addition, any broadcast intent may include a URI that references data that the receiving component does not normally have the privileges to access. The sender of the intent can include special privileges that grant the receiver read or write access to the specific URI included in the intent. A malicious receiver that intercepts this intent will also gain those privileges and be able to read or write the resource at the specified URI.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

However, when an application registers to receive these implicit system intents, it is also registered to receive any explicit intents. While a malicious application cannot send an implicit system intent, it can send an explicit intent to the target application, which may assume that any received intent is a valid implicit system intent and not an explicit intent from another application. This may lead to unintended behavior.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nIntent Spoofing\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-940\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry will be made more comprehensive in later CWE versions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not initialize a critical resource.\n\n### Extended Description\nMany resources require initialization before they can be properly used. If a resource is not initialized, it could contain unpredictable or expired data, or it could be initialized to defaults that are invalid. This can have security implications when the resource is expected to have certain properties or values.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nCanPrecede -> CWE-908\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-20739:** A variable that has its value set in a conditional statement is sometimes used when the conditional fails, sometimes causing data leakage\n- **CVE-2005-1036:** Chain: Bypass of access restrictions due to improper authorization (CWE-862) of a user results from an improperly initialized (CWE-909) I/O permission bitmap\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which \"permissions\" are not checked, which is an \"authorization\" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].\n**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n- **CVE-2009-3482:** Anti-virus product sets insecure \"Everyone: Full Control\" permissions for files under the \"Program Files\" folder, allowing attackers to replace executables with Trojan horses.\n- **CVE-2009-3897:** Product creates directories with 0777 permissions at installation, allowing users to gain privileges and access a socket used for authentication.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nA race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.\n\n\nA race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:\n\n\n  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.\n\n  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.\n\nA race condition exists when an \"interfering code sequence\" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.\n\nThe interfering code sequence could be \"trusted\" or \"untrusted.\" A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nRace Condition\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-691\nCanPrecede -> CWE-416\nCanPrecede -> CWE-476\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed. They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.\n\n**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nCode frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-400\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nChildOf -> CWE-400\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).\n\n**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. \"Resource exhaustion\" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..\n- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.\n\n"
