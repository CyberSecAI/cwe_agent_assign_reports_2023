This is a critical confidentiality risk.\n*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based attacks. An attacker can send malicious requests to the vulnerable endpoint, with a crafted path that will cause the server to access files outside of the intended directory.\n*   **Required Capabilities:** No specific privileges or user interaction are required to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker only needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable application.\n\n**CVE Specific Details:**\n\nThe provided content includes descriptions from the GitHub Advisory Database for multiple CVEs (although the original `CVE-2022-31568` is not explicitly described but is related to `GHSA-7x32-hrhc-wc59` which is included). All the vulnerabilities have the same root cause (unsafe usage of the Flask `send_file` function)\n\nHere's a summary of CVEs explicitly mentioned:\n\n*   **CVE-2022-31551 (GHSA-7x32-hrhc-wc59):** Affects the `pleomax00/flask-mongo-skel` repository.\n*   **CVE-2022-31555 (GHSA-g49j-8c9g-mfwc):** Affects the `romain20100/nursequest` repository.\n*   **CVE-2022-31538 (GHSA-546q-322q-64p5):** Affects the `joaopedro-fg/mp-m08-interface` repository.\n*   **CVE-2022-31537 (GHSA-fph4-56rm-4r3r):** Affects the `jmcginty15/Solar-system-simulator` repository.\n*   **CVE-2022-31515 (GHSA-mmhx-6x77-4jf4):** Affects the `Delor4/CarceresBE` repository.\n*   **CVE-2022-31572 (GHSA-3p6x-7vmm-w6rr):** Affects the `ceee-vip/cockybook` repository.\n*  **CVE-2022-31528 (GHSA-c65v-pv29-vr3p):** Affects the `bonn-activity-maps/bam_annotation_tool` repository.\n*   **CVE-2022-31562 (GHSA-j234-jfvv-q6rv):** Affects the `waveyan/internshipsystem` repository.\n*   **CVE-2022-31554 (GHSA-9468-gqgp-5w48):** Affects the `rohitnayak/movie-review-sentiment-analysis` repository.\n*   **CVE-2022-31504 (GHSA-3vcx-qq88-36qg):** Affects the `ChangeWeDer/BaiduWenkuSpider_flaskWeb` repository.\n*   **CVE-2022-31532 (GHSA-2gcx-r92j-2xqc):** Affects the `dankolbman/travel_blahg` repository.\n*   **CVE-2022-31570 (GHSA-whqv-vqc6-m2pw):** Affects the `adriankoczuruek/ceneo-web-scrapper` repository.\n*  **CVE-2022-31556 (GHSA-742q-7cvg-pg5f):** Affects the `rusyasoft/TrainEnergyServer` repository.\n*  **CVE-2022-31577 (GHSA-8xf2-whvm-vp6x):** Affects the `seveas/golem` repository.\n*  **CVE-2022-31551 (GHSA-7x32-hrhc-wc59):** Affects the `pleomax00/flask-mongo-skel` repository.\n*   **CVE-2022-31515 (GHSA-mmhx-6x77-4jf4):** Affects the `Delor4/CarceresBE` repository.\n*  **CVE-2022-31535 (GHSA-496w-h6x3-rhm8):** Affects the `freefood89/Fishtank` repository.\n*  **CVE-2022-31537 (GHSA-fph4-56rm-4r3r):** Affects the `jmcginty15/Solar-system-simulator` repository.\n*  **CVE-2022-31578 (GHSA-2frx-938j-793v):** Affects the `piaoyunsoft/bt_lnmp` repository.\n*  **CVE-2022-31509 (GHSA-q23g-44vv-jwh7):** Affects the `iedadata/usap-dc-website` repository.\n*  **CVE-2022-31510 (GHSA-2q65-c69r-5v5v):** Affects the `sergeKashkin/Simple-RAT` repository.\n*   **CVE-2022-31563 (GHSA-chj5-j96x-q9rq):** Affects the `whmacmac/vprj` repository.\n*   **CVE-2022-31566 (GHSA-625q-87rr-w32g):** Affects the `DSAB-local/DSAB` repository.\n*  **CVE-2022-31518 (GHSA-pjqh-cwf4-prqq):** Affects the `JustAnotherSoftwareDeveloper/Python-Recipe-Database` repository.\n*  **CVE-2022-31520 (GHSA-g5qq-w3mh-h2p5):** Affects the `Luxas98/logstash-management-api` repository.\n*  **CVE-2022-31521 (GHSA-2gcx-r92j-2xqc):** Affects the `Niyaz-Mohamed/Mosaic` repository.\n*   **CVE-2022-31576 (GHSA-742q-7cvg-pg5f):** Affects the `heidi-luong1109/shackerpanel` repository.\n*   **CVE-2022-31579 (GHSA-xchf-4r8r-m2wj):** Affects the `ralphjzhang/iasset` repository.\n*   **CVE-2022-31582 (GHSA-vqw3-39gh-6m29):** Affects the `shaolo1/VideoServer` repository.\n*   **CVE-2022-31583 (GHSA-2fq6-rxr5-6q4h):** Affects the `sravaniboinepelli/AutomatedQuizEval` repository.\n*  **CVE-2022-31574 (GHSA-ffhw-7rh2-4x5w):** Affects the `duducosmos/livro_python` repository.\n*  **CVE-2022-31571 (GHSA-q9cv-2r3j-9pwh):** Affects the `akashtalole/python-flask-restful-api` repository.\n*   **CVE-2022-31560 (GHSA-3pjv-vr3x-68m5):** Affects the `uncleYiba/photo_tag` repository.\n*   **CVE-2022-31567 (GHSA-2744-2crm-9w87):** Affects the `DSABenchmark/DSAB` repository.\n*  **CVE-2022-31559 (GHSA-fmr5-qw46-rqmv):** Affects the `tsileo/flask-yeoman` repository.\n*   **CVE-2022-31585 (GHSA-gq38-75hc-xc85):** Affects the `umeshpatil-dev/Home__internet` repository.\n*  **CVE-2022-31588 (GHSA-whrg-vww5-2f8w):** Affects the `zippies/testplatform` repository.\n*   **CVE-2022-31569 (GHSA-8588-w48w-jp6g):** Affects the `yuriyouzhou/KG-fashion-chatbot` repository.\n\n**Additional Notes from GHSA-669 discussion:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is consistently related to the usage of Flask's `send_file` function with unsanitized input\n*   Some discussion indicated that `os.path.join` is also used incorrectly and is not safe for constructing paths\n*   The discussion indicated that the issue was found using CodeQL by GitHub.\n*   A discussion on the GHSA issue mentioned that the vulnerability is an absolute path traversal issue due to incorrect use of `send_file` function in flask. This also included an example of the exploit using curl.\n*   Some maintainers may have used `flask.safe_join` or `flask.send_from_directory` to fix the issue, while some maintainers didn't fix the issue.\n*   Several CVEs were assigned to repositories that were not considered widely used or not well maintained.\n*   A comment from one of the participants indicated that the tool they used to find vulnerabilities, such as OWASP dependency-check, is only as good as the data it uses.\n*   There is some discussion on the proper way of reporting a vulnerability to the maintainer.\n\n**Recommendations for Mitigation (from GHSA-669):**\n\n*   **Avoid using `send_file` with untrusted input:** The use of untrusted parameters with `send_file` is the main source of this vulnerability.\n*  **Use `flask.safe_join` for building paths:** If input from users need to be used in path generation, `flask.safe_join` should be used.\n*  **Use `flask.send_from_directory` instead:** Whenever possible, use `send_from_directory`, it handles path traversal automatically.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe core vulnerability is related to a coding pattern where user controlled input is being passed to Flask\u2019s `send_file` without prior sanitization or validation. This can easily lead to arbitrary file access.\nIt's also important to note that most of the vulnerable repositories appear to be projects that are either personal, academic or otherwise unmaintained. This could increase the risk as a patch may not be forthcoming.\n\nThis information is based on the provided content and does not have context or additional data that might be found in external resources or more advanced analysis.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | Base | Allowed | alternate_terms | 0.800 |\n| 2 | 36 | Absolute Path Traversal | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.346 |\n| 3 | 73 | External Control of File Name or Path | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.195 |\n| 4 | 23 | Relative Path Traversal | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.147 |\n| 5 | 37 | Path Traversal: '/absolute/pathname/here' | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.124 |\n| 6 | 24 | Path Traversal: '../filedir' | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.560 |\n| 7 | 59 | Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 38 | Path Traversal: '\\absolute\\pathname\\here' | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.111 |\n| 9 | 182 | Collapse of Data into Unsafe Value | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.104 |\n| 10 | 39 | Path Traversal: 'C:dirname' | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.102 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDirectory traversal\nPath traversal: \"Path traversal\" is preferred over \"directory traversal,\" but both terms are attack-focused.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add \".txt\" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.\n\n**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.\n\n**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing \"/\" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nLike other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use \"directory traversal\" only to refer to the injection of \"..\" and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.\n\n\nOther variants like \"absolute pathname\" and \"drive letter\" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve \"..\" or equivalent.\n\n\n**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.\n\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nIncomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that \"..\\\" is vulnerable, but not test \"../\" which may also be vulnerable.\n\n\nAny combination of directory separators (\"/\", \"\\\", etc.) and numbers of \".\" (e.g. \"....\") can produce unique variants; for example, the \"//../\" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama\n- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the \"\\\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as \"/abs/path\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-22\nChildOf -> CWE-22\nChildOf -> CWE-22\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-31503:** Python package constructs filenames using an unsafe os.path.join call on untrusted input, allowing absolute path traversal because os.path.join resets the pathname to an absolute path that is specified as part of the input.\n- **CVE-2002-1345:** Multiple FTP clients write arbitrary files via absolute paths in server responses\n- **CVE-2001-1269:** ZIP file extractor allows full path\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis could allow an attacker to access or modify system files or other files that are critical to the application.\n\n\nPath manipulation errors occur when the following two conditions are met:\n\n```\n\t\t1. An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.\n\t\t2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.\n```\nFor example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-642\nChildOf -> CWE-610\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-22\nCanPrecede -> CWE-41\nCanPrecede -> CWE-98\nCanPrecede -> CWE-434\nCanPrecede -> CWE-59\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** CWE-114 is a Class, but it is listed a child of CWE-73 in view 1000. This suggests some abstraction problems that should be resolved in future versions.\n\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThe external control of filenames can be the primary link in chains with other file-related weaknesses, as seen in the CanPrecede relationships. This is because software systems use files for many different purposes: to execute programs, load code libraries, to store application data, to store configuration settings, record temporary data, act as signals or semaphores to other processes, etc.\n\n\nHowever, those weaknesses do not always require external control. For example, link-following weaknesses (CWE-59) often involve pathnames that are not controllable by the attacker at all.\n\n\nThe external control can be resultant from other issues. For example, in PHP applications, the register_globals setting can allow an attacker to modify variables that the programmer thought were immutable, enabling file inclusion (CWE-98) and path traversal (CWE-22). Operating with excessive privileges (CWE-250) might allow an attacker to specify an input filename that is not directly readable by the attacker, but is accessible to the privileged program. A buffer overflow (CWE-119) might give an attacker control over nearby memory locations that are related to pathnames, but were not directly modifiable by the attacker.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n- **CVE-2008-5748:** Chain: external control of values for user's desired language and theme enables path traversal.\n- **CVE-2008-5764:** Chain: external control of user's target language enables remote file inclusion.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nZip Slip: \"Zip slip\" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282].

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Overlaps regular expressions, although an implementation might not necessarily use regexp's.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2004-0815:** \"/.////\" in pathname collapses to absolute path.\n- **CVE-2005-3123:** \"/.//..//////././\" is collapsed into \"/.././\" after \"..\" and \"//\" sequences are removed.\n- **CVE-2002-0325:** \".../...//\" collapsed to \"...\" due to removal of \"./\" in web server.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-39: Path Traversal: 'C:dirname'\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product accepts input that contains a drive letter or Windows volume letter ('C:dirname') that potentially redirects access to an unintended location or arbitrary file.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-36\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-0038:** Remote attackers can read arbitrary files by specifying the drive letter in the requested URL.\n- **CVE-2001-0255:** FTP server allows remote attackers to list arbitrary directories by using the \"ls\" command and including the drive letter name (e.g. C:) in the requested pathname.\n- **CVE-2001-0687:** FTP server allows a remote attacker to retrieve privileged system information by specifying arbitrary paths.\n\n",
