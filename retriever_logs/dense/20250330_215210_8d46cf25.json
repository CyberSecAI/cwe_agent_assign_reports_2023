There is a potential **heap-based buffer overflow** and **heap-based buffer over-read** in DTLS if MBEDTLS_SSL_DTLS_CONNECTION_ID is enabled and MBEDTLS_SSL_CID_IN_LEN_MAX > 2 * MBEDTLS_SSL_CID_OUT_LEN_MAX.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## WEAKNESS: 'heap-based buffer overflow'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1. CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 365.81)\n\nA heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc()....\n\n### 2. CWE-126: Buffer Over-read (Score: 363.39)\n\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer....\n\n### 3. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 343.94)\n\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to st...\n\n### 4. CWE-193: Off-by-one Error (Score: 322.14)\n\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value....\n\n### 5. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 311.36)\n\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties....\n\n## WEAKNESS: 'heap-based buffer over-read'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1.
