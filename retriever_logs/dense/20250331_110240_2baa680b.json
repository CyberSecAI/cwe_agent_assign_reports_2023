  "query": "## Vulnerability Description\nNSS (Network Security Services) versions prior to 3.73 or 3.68.1 ESR are vulnerable to a **heap overflow** when handling DER-encoded DSA or RSA-PSS signatures. Applications using NSS for handling signatures encoded within CMS, S/MIME, PKCS \\#7, or PKCS \\#12 are likely to be impacted. Applications using NSS for certificate validation or other TLS, X.509, OCSP or CRL functionality may be impacted, depending on how they configure NSS. *Note This vulnerability does NOT impact Mozilla Firefox.* However, email clients and PDF viewers that use NSS for signature verification, such as Thunderbird, LibreOffice, Evolution and Evince are believed to be impacted. This vulnerability affects NSS < 3.73 and NSS < 3.68.1.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **weakness:** **heap overflow**\n- **product:** NSS (Network Security Services)\n- **version:** < 3.73 or 3.68.1 ESR\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43527:\n\n**1. Verification of Content Relevance:**\n\nThe content directly relates to CVE-2021-43527. This is explicitly stated in the text, referencing the CVE ID and describing a vulnerability within the NSS library. Multiple sources confirm the vulnerability including:\n*   Mozilla Security Advisory (mfsa2021-51)\n*   NetApp Advisory (NTAP-20211229-0002)\n*   Siemens Security Advisory (SSA-594438)\n*   Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 202212-05)\n*   StarWind Security Advisory (SW-20220802-0001)\n*   Mozilla Bugzilla entry (Bug 1737470)\n\n**2. Vulnerability Details:**\n\n*   **Root Cause:** A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `decodeECorDSASignature` function of the NSS library when handling DER-encoded DSA and RSA-PSS signatures. The function fails to properly validate the length of the signature data before copying it to a fixed-size buffer.\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   **Improper Input Validation:** The core weakness lies in the missing or inadequate input validation of the signature length, leading to the overflow.\n    *   **Heap Overflow:** The overflow occurs in a heap-allocated buffer within the `VFYContextStr` structure, potentially corrupting other heap data.\n*   **Impact:**\n    *   **Remote Code Execution:** The heap overflow can allow an attacker to overwrite heap memory, potentially redirecting control flow to execute arbitrary code. As demonstrated by Tavis Ormandy in Bugzilla #1737470 comment #4.\n    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The memory corruption can lead to crashes, thereby causing a denial of service.\n    *   **Bypass Signature Verification:** The overflow could allow a malicious signature to be accepted as valid, enabling further attacks.\n*   **Attack Vectors:**\n    *   **Malicious Certificates:** Exploiting the vulnerability through crafted certificates that contain large DSA/RSA-PSS signatures. This affects certificate validation, S/MIME, PKCS#7, and PKCS#12.\n    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** In theory, an attacker could inject a malicious signature during the handshake as described by Robert Relyea in Bugzilla #1737470 comment #23 (although Ryan Sleevi explains in comment #24, this is not the case for TLS signatures). \n    *   **S/MIME Email:** Email clients using NSS for S/MIME verification are vulnerable as shown in Bugzilla #1737470 comment #27 where Kai Engert states Thunderbird is affected.\n*   **Attacker Capabilities:**\n    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send data to the vulnerable server. This could be through an active MitM attack, or via a vector where the application connects to an untrusted server which provides malicious data.\n    *   **Crafted Payloads:** The attacker must create a malicious signature that triggers the overflow, typically through DSA or RSA-PSS signatures.\n\n**3. Specific Product Impacts (from the provided content):**\n\n*   **Mozilla NSS:** Vulnerable versions are those prior to 3.73 and 3.68.1 ESR.\n*   **Thunderbird, Evolution, LibreOffice, Evince:** Affected through S/MIME verification as these clients use NSS for signature validation.\n*   **NetApp Products:** E-Series SANtricity OS Controller Software 11.x and NetApp Cloud Backup are identified as affected.\n*   **Siemens RUGGEDCOM ROX:** Multiple models (MX5000, RX1400, RX1500, RX1501, RX1510, RX1511, RX1512, RX1524, RX1536, RX5000) using versions >= V2.10.0 and < V2.15.0 of RUGGEDCOM ROX devices are affected.\n*   **StarWind Products:** SAN&NAS (vSAN) V8 R13 and StarWind VSAN Version V8 (build 14398) are vulnerable.\n*   **Oracle Products:** Multiple products are listed in the Oracle Critical Patch Update advisory as vulnerable, using NSS directly or indirectly. These range from Cloud Native Core, E-Business Suite, Fusion Middleware, and others.\n*   **Gentoo:** Affected versions of the `dev-libs/nss` package are those below 3.79.2.\n\n**4. Mitigations and Workarounds:**\n\n*   **Update NSS:** The primary mitigation is to update NSS to versions 3.73 or 3.68.1 ESR, or any later version containing a fix.\n*  **Specific Patches:** For specific products, such as StarWind SAN and NAS to version V8 R13.\n*   **IPsec Reconfiguration (Siemens):** Reconfiguring IPsec connections to use a pre-shared key (PSK) is a suggested workaround for RUGGEDCOM devices.\n*   **Thunderbird workaround:** An application-specific workaround was implemented in Thunderbird where certificate import was changed to only accept certificates that passed `mozpkix` verification.\n*   **Disable DSA:** Since DSA is not used within all supported configurations of applications using NSS, this can serve as a workaround.\n\n**5. Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability primarily affects the processing of DSA and RSA-PSS signatures.\n*   Firefox, due to its specific usage of `mozpkix`, is considered not directly vulnerable to remote exploitation in normal use cases, as it does not accept DSA and RSA-PSS certificates. Manual certificate imports may expose users if the certificates have malicious signatures.\n*   The vulnerability exists in the NSS library for a long time and is present in code from as early as 2003.\n*   The bug could be triggered remotely in Thunderbird, Gnome Evolution, and any other client that processes S/MIME emails and validates DSA certificates.\n*   Several vendors made changes in response, which include, patching NSS, or disabling specific code paths that were vulnerable.\n*   This bug was found during what was described as novel fuzzing techniques.\n*   The root cause is not a logic error, but the missing validation for sizes of data read from DER structures in `decodeECorDSASignature`, causing an out-of-bounds write on the heap.\n\nThis analysis extracts key information related to CVE-2021-43527 from the provided documents, detailing the nature of the vulnerability, its impact, and the necessary steps for remediation.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | Base | Allowed | alternate_terms | 0.800 |\n| 2 | 122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.580 |\n| 3 | 347 | Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.503 |\n| 4 | 295 | Improper Certificate Validation | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.464 |\n| 5 | 125 | Out-of-bounds Read | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.464 |\n| 6 | 297 | Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.570 |\n| 7 | 128 | Wrap-around Error | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 787 | Out-of-bounds Write | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.451 |\n| 9 | 327 | Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.450 |\n| 10 | 116 | Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.443 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may\n         become a very small or negative number.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOverflow: The terms \"overflow\" and \"wraparound\" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.\nWraparound: The terms \"overflow\" and \"wraparound\" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.\nwrap, wrap-around, wrap around: Alternate spellings of \"wraparound\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with \"overflow,\" \"underflow,\" and \"wraparound\" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called \"underflows\").\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\n\"Integer overflow\" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.\n\n\nA \"wraparound\" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.\n\n\n\"Overflow\" is sometimes conflated with \"wraparound\" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.\n\n\nThe \"overflow\" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use \"overflow\" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using \"underflow\" for exceeding the minimum.\n\n\nSome people use \"overflow\" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses \"underflow\" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.\n\n\nSee [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.\n\n\n**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-788\nChildOf -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Heap-based buffer overflows are usually just as dangerous as stack-based buffer overflows.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2007-4268:** Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nChildOf -> CWE-345\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

The product might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the product might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nPeerOf -> CWE-322\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

If the certificate's host-specific data is not properly checked - such as the Common Name (CN) in the Subject or the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension of an X.509 certificate - it may be possible for a redirection or spoofing attack to allow a malicious host with a valid certificate to provide data, impersonating a trusted host. In order to ensure data integrity, the certificate must be valid and it must pertain to the site that is being accessed.\n\n\nEven if the product attempts to check the hostname, it is still possible to incorrectly check the hostname. For example, attackers could create a certificate with a name that begins with a trusted name followed by a NUL byte, which could cause some string-based comparisons to only examine the portion that contains the trusted name.\n\n\nThis weakness can occur even when the product uses Certificate Pinning, if the product does not verify the hostname at the time a certificate is pinned.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-923\nChildOf -> CWE-295\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.\n\n\nIt is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.\n\n\nSince the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered \"unsafe\" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.\n\n\nFor a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-693\nPeerOf -> CWE-311\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30273:** SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity\n- **CVE-2022-30320:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.\n- **CVE-2008-3775:** Product uses \"ROT-25\" to obfuscate the password in the registry.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nImproper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.\n\n\nMost products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, \"GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\" is a structured message containing a command (\"GET\") with a single argument (\"/index.html\") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (\"HTTP/1.1\").\n\n\nIf an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOutput Sanitization\nOutput Validation\nOutput Encoding\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\nCanPrecede -> CWE-74\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness is primary to all weaknesses related to injection (CWE-74) since the inherent nature of injection involves the violation of structured messages.\n\n**[Relationship]** \n\nCWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.\n\n\nHowever, input validation is not always sufficient, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a last name is inserted into a query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise neutralized. In this case, stripping the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.\n\n\n**[Terminology]** The usage of the \"encoding\" and \"escaping\" terms varies widely. For example, in some programming languages, the terms are used interchangeably, while other languages provide APIs that use both terms for different tasks. This overlapping usage extends to the Web, such as the \"escape\" JavaScript function whose purpose is stated to be encoding. The concepts of encoding and escaping predate the Web by decades. Given such a context, it is difficult for CWE to adopt a consistent vocabulary that will not be misinterpreted by some constituency.\n\n**[Theoretical]** This is a data/directive boundary error in which data boundaries are not sufficiently enforced before it is sent to a different control sphere.\n\n**[Research Gap]** While many published vulnerabilities are related to insufficient output encoding, there is such an emphasis on input validation as a protection mechanism that the underlying causes are rarely described. Within CVE, the focus is primarily on well-understood issues like cross-site scripting and SQL injection. It is likely that this weakness frequently occurs in custom protocols that support multiple encodings, which are not necessarily detectable with automated techniques.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-41232:** Chain: authentication routine in Go-based agile development product does not escape user name (CWE-116), allowing LDAP injection (CWE-90)\n- **CVE-2008-4636:** OS command injection in backup software using shell metacharacters in a filename; correct behavior would require that this filename could not be changed.\n- **CVE-2008-0769:** Web application does not set the charset when sending a page to a browser, allowing for XSS exploitation when a browser chooses an unexpected encoding.\n\n",
