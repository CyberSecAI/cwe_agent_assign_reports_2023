Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-1017:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to write 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.\n- **CVE-2021-21220:** Chain: insufficient input validation (CWE-20) in browser allows heap corruption (CWE-787), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-28664:** GPU kernel driver allows memory corruption because a user can obtain read/write access to read-only pages, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen the product accesses the resource using an incompatible type, this could trigger logical errors because the resource does not have expected properties. In languages without memory safety, such as C and C++, type confusion can lead to out-of-bounds memory access.\n\n\nWhile this weakness is frequently associated with unions when parsing data with many different embedded object types in C, it can be present in any application that can interpret the same variable or memory location in multiple ways.\n\n\nThis weakness is not unique to C and C++. For example, errors in PHP applications can be triggered by providing array parameters when scalars are expected, or vice versa. Languages such as Perl, which perform automatic conversion of a variable of one type when it is accessed as if it were another type, can also contain these issues.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nObject Type Confusion\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-704\nChildOf -> CWE-704\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Applicable Platform]** \n\nThis weakness is possible in any type-unsafe programming language.\n\n\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nType confusion weaknesses have received some attention by applied researchers and major software vendors for C and C++ code. Some publicly-reported vulnerabilities probably have type confusion as a root-cause weakness, but these may be described as \"memory corruption\" instead.\n\n\nFor other languages, there are very few public reports of type confusion weaknesses. These are probably under-studied. Since many programs rely directly or indirectly on loose typing, a potential \"type confusion\" behavior might be intentional, possibly requiring more manual analysis.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2010-4577:** Type confusion in CSS sequence leads to out-of-bounds read.\n- **CVE-2011-0611:** Size inconsistency allows code execution, first discovered when it was actively exploited in-the-wild.\n- **CVE-2010-0258:** Improperly-parsed file containing records of different types leads to code execution when a memory location is interpreted as a different object than intended.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-277: Insecure Inherited Permissions\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA product defines a set of insecure permissions that are inherited by objects that are created by the program.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-732\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2005-1841:** User's umask is used when creating temp files.\n- **CVE-2002-1786:** Insecure umask for core dumps [is the umask preserved or assigned?].\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-415: Double Free\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a program calls free() twice with the same argument, the program's memory management data structures become corrupted. This corruption can cause the program to crash or, in some circumstances, cause two later calls to malloc() to return the same pointer. If malloc() returns the same value twice and the program later gives the attacker control over the data that is written into this doubly-allocated memory, the program becomes vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDouble-free\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-825\nChildOf -> CWE-1341\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-666\nPeerOf -> CWE-416\nPeerOf -> CWE-123\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is usually resultant from another weakness, such as an unhandled error or race condition between threads. It could also be primary to weaknesses such as buffer overflows.\n\n**[Theoretical]** It could be argued that Double Free would be most appropriately located as a child of \"Use after Free\", but \"Use\" and \"Release\" are considered to be distinct operations within vulnerability theory, therefore this is more accurately \"Release of a Resource after Expiration or Release\", which doesn't exist yet.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2006-5051:** Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\n- **CVE-2004-0642:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n- **CVE-2004-0772:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\nWhen access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information\n- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.\n- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which \"permissions\" are not checked, which is an \"authorization\" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].\n**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n- **CVE-2009-3482:** Anti-virus product sets insecure \"Everyone: Full Control\" permissions for files under the \"Program Files\" folder, allowing attackers to replace executables with Trojan horses.\n- **CVE-2009-3897:** Product creates directories with 0777 permissions at installation, allowing users to gain privileges and access a socket used for authentication.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nAny condition where the attacker has the ability to write an arbitrary value to an arbitrary location, often as the result of a buffer overflow.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-787\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input or data, but it does\n        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the\n        properties that are required to process the data safely and\n        correctly.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nInput validation is a frequently-used technique for checking potentially dangerous inputs in order to ensure that the inputs are safe for processing within the code, or when communicating with other components. When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nInput validation is not the only technique for processing input, however. Other techniques attempt to transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well (see CWE-138 for more examples.)\n\n\nInput validation can be applied to:\n\n\n  - raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.\n\n  - metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size\n\nData can be simple or structured. Structured data can be composed of many nested layers, composed of combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or structured data.\n\nMany properties of raw data or metadata may need to be validated upon entry into the code, such as:\n\n\n  - specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.\n\n  - implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size\n\n  - indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures\n\n  - symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.\n\n  - well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax \n\n  - lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token\n\n  - specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)\n\n  - consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.\n\n  - conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic \n\n  - equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same\n\n  - authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data\n\nImplied or derived properties of data must often be calculated or inferred by the code itself. Errors in deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor to improper input validation. \n\nNote that \"input validation\" has very different meanings to different people, or within different classification schemes. Caution must be used when referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it. For example, some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control to an attacker over an input when they should not be able to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred to as input validation.\n\n\nFinally, it is important to emphasize that the distinctions between input validation and output escaping are often blurred, and developers must be careful to understand the difference, including how input validation is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, this valid name cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\nPeerOf -> CWE-345\nCanPrecede -> CWE-22\nCanPrecede -> CWE-41\nCanPrecede -> CWE-74\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-770\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis. It is also a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Consider lower-level children such as Improper Use of Validation Framework (CWE-1173) or improper validation involving specific types or properties of input such as Specified Quantity (CWE-1284); Specified Index, Position, or Offset (CWE-1285); Syntactic Correctness (CWE-1286); Specified Type (CWE-1287); Consistency within Input (CWE-1288); or Unsafe Equivalence (CWE-1289).\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-1284: Specified Quantity\n- CWE-1285: Specified Index, Position, or Offset\n- CWE-1286: Syntactic Correctness\n- CWE-1287: Specified Type\n- CWE-1288: Consistency within Input\n- CWE-1289: Unsafe Equivalence\n- CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nCWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.\n\n\n**[Maintenance]** As of 2020, this entry is used more often than preferred, and it is a source of frequent confusion. It is being actively modified for CWE 4.1 and subsequent versions.\n\n**[Maintenance]** Concepts such as validation, data transformation, and neutralization are being refined, so relationships between CWE-20 and other entries such as CWE-707 may change in future versions, along with an update to the Vulnerability Theory document.\n\n**[Maintenance]** Input validation - whether missing or incorrect - is such an essential and widespread part of secure development that it is implicit in many different weaknesses. Traditionally, problems such as buffer overflows and XSS have been classified as input validation problems by many security professionals. However, input validation is not necessarily the only protection mechanism available for avoiding such problems, and in some cases it is not even sufficient. The CWE team has begun capturing these subtleties in chains within the Research Concepts view (CWE-1000), but more work is needed.\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nThe \"input validation\" term is extremely common, but it is used in many different ways. In some cases its usage can obscure the real underlying weakness or otherwise hide chaining and composite relationships.\n\n\nSome people use \"input validation\" as a general term that covers many different neutralization techniques for ensuring that input is appropriate, such as filtering, canonicalization, and escaping. Others use the term in a more narrow context to simply mean \"checking if an input conforms to expectations without changing it.\" CWE uses this more narrow interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n- **CVE-2021-30860:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) leads to integer overflow (CWE-190) in mobile OS, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis can have security implications when the associated resource is expected to have certain properties or values, such as a variable that determines whether a user has been authenticated or not.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-664\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-1471:** chain: an invalid value prevents a library file from being included, skipping initialization of key variables, leading to resultant eval injection.\n- **CVE-2008-3637:** Improper error checking in protection mechanism produces an uninitialized variable, allowing security bypass and code execution.\n- **CVE-2008-4197:** Use of uninitialized memory may allow code execution.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-284: Improper Access Control\n**Abstraction:** Pillar\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAccess control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:\n\n\n  - Authentication (proving the identity of an actor)\n\n  - Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and\n\n  - Accountability (tracking of activities that were performed)\n\nWhen any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.\n\nThere are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:\n\n\n  - Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.\n\n  - Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthorization: The terms \"access control\" and \"authorization\" are often used interchangeably, although many people have distinct definitions. The CWE usage of \"access control\" is intended as a general term for the various mechanisms that restrict which users can access which resources, and \"authorization\" is more narrowly defined. It is unlikely that there will be community consensus on the use of these terms.\n\n### Relationships\nNone\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-284 is extremely high-level, a Pillar. Its name, \"Improper Access Control,\" is often misused in low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287] or by active use of the OWASP Top Ten, such as \"A01:2021-Broken Access Control\". It is not useful for trend analysis.\n**Comments:** Consider using descendants of CWE-284 that are more specific to the kind of access control involved, such as those involving authorization (Missing Authorization (CWE-862), Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863), Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource (CWE-732), etc.); authentication (Missing Authentication (CWE-306) or Weak Authentication (CWE-1390)); Incorrect User Management (CWE-286); Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints (CWE-923); etc.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n- Abstraction\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n- CWE-306: Missing Authentication\n- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n- CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** \n\nThis entry needs more work. Possible sub-categories include:\n\n\n  - Trusted group includes undesired entities (partially covered by CWE-286)\n\n  - Group can perform undesired actions\n\n  - ACL parse error does not fail closed\n\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-24985:** A form hosting website only checks the session authentication status for a single form, making it possible to bypass authentication when there are multiple forms\n- **CVE-2022-29238:** Access-control setting in web-based document collaboration tool is not properly implemented by the code, which prevents listing hidden directories but does not prevent direct requests to files in those directories.\n- **CVE-2022-23607:** Python-based HTTP library did not scope cookies to a particular domain such that \"supercookies\" could be sent to any domain on redirect\n\n",
