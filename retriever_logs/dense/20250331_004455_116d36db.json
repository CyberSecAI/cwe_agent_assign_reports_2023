A remote attacker with network access to the proxy server could leverage this vulnerability to connect to VNC servers protected by the proxy server without providing any authentication credentials. Exploitation of this issue requires that the proxy server is currently accepting connections for the target VNC server.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **weakness:** **authentication bypass**\n- **impact:** gain unauthorized access to VNC session and disconnect legitimate user from VNC session\n- **attacker:** remote attacker\n- **product:** OSU Open Source Lab VNCAuthProxy\n- **version:** through 1.1.1\n- **component:** vncap/vnc/protocol.py VNCServerAuthenticator\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36436:\n\n**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**\n\n*   The content directly references CVE-2022-36436 and describes an authentication bypass vulnerability in Twisted VNC Authentication Proxy, which aligns with the CVE description.\n\n**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from the VNCAuthProxy not enforcing the \"VNC Authentication\" security type during the RFB handshake.\n*   The proxy server advertises both \"None\" (no authentication) and \"VNC Authentication\" as supported security types.\n*   The proxy server accepts the client's selection of \"None\" as a valid security type and proceeds without requiring authentication.\n\n**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Authentication Bypass:** The core weakness is the lack of enforcement of the VNC Authentication security type, allowing connections without proper authentication.\n*   **Hardcoded Security Types:** The supported security types are hardcoded, making it difficult to enforce specific authentication methods.\n*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The proxy accepts the client's security type selection without validation.\n\n**4. Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can bypass authentication and connect to VNC servers protected by the proxy.\n*   **Session Hijacking (Shared Access):** By setting the shared-flag option to true, attackers can join an existing VNC session, gaining the same access level as a legitimate user.\n*   **Denial of Service:** By setting the shared-flag to false, attackers can disconnect legitimate users from their VNC sessions.\n\n**5. Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the proxy server.\n*   **Port Scanning:**  Attackers must scan the dynamic port range (5800-5899) to identify active connections to VNC servers.\n*   **RFB Handshake Manipulation:** The attacker needs to send specific RFB messages to bypass authentication\n\n**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be able to reach the proxy server over the network.\n*   **VNC Client:** The attacker needs a VNC client that can be configured to request the \"None\" security type (or a modified client).\n*   **Timing:** Attackers must identify when the proxy server is actively accepting connections for a specific target VNC server.\n\n**Additional Information from Content:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was identified during a security audit.\n*   The fix was implemented in version 1.2.0 of Twisted VNC Authentication Proxy.\n*   The vulnerability affects all versions prior to 1.2.0.\n*   The content from `cert.grnet.gr` provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, exploitation, indicators of compromise, and a sample script for detecting exploitation.\n*   The vulnerability can be detected in logs by looking for instances where \"Successfully authenticated a client\" messages exist without the corresponding \"Doing VNC auth, buf\" messages.\n* The Github advisory page includes a CVSS v4 score of 9.3 which is critical\n* The patch includes modifications to `vncap/tests/test_protocol.py` to test the fix.\n* The patch modifies `vncap/vnc/protocol.py` to only allow VNC auth and remove the No auth option by sending `\\x01\\x02` instead of `\\x02\\x01\\x02` as an option to client.\n\n**Summary of Vulnerability:**\n\nTwisted VNC Authentication Proxy fails to properly enforce authentication during the initial handshake, allowing remote attackers with network access to bypass authentication and access or terminate VNC sessions if the proxy server is currently accepting connections for the target VNC server. This is achieved by the attacker requesting the \"None\" security type and the server accepting the selection.\n\nThe provided content provides a good overview of the vulnerability.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 757 | Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.884 |\n| 2 | 287 | Improper Authentication | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.540 |\n| 3 | 1390 | Weak Authentication | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.483 |\n| 4 | 290 | Authentication Bypass by Spoofing | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.474 |\n| 5 | 201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.473 |\n| 6 | 305 | Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.538 |\n| 7 | 613 | Insufficient Session Expiration | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.463 |\n| 9 | 319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.458 |\n| 10 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.457 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nA protocol or its implementation supports interaction between multiple actors and allows those actors to negotiate which algorithm should be used as a protection mechanism such as encryption or authentication, but it does not select the strongest algorithm that is available to both parties.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a security mechanism can be forced to downgrade to use a less secure algorithm, this can make it easier for attackers to compromise the product by exploiting weaker algorithm.

For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30018:** A messaging platform serializes all elements of User/Group objects, making private information available to adversaries\n- **CVE-2022-29959:** Initialization file contains credentials that can be decoded using a \"simple string transformation\"\n- **CVE-2022-35411:** Python-based RPC framework enables pickle functionality by default, allowing clients to unpickle untrusted data.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany communication channels can be \"sniffed\" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.\n\n\nApplicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.\n\n\nWhen full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to \"sniff\" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information. \n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-311\nChildOf -> CWE-311\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

See examples.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2006-4302:** Attacker can select an older version of the software to exploit its vulnerabilities.\n- **CVE-2006-4407:** Improper prioritization of encryption ciphers during negotiation leads to use of a weaker cipher.\n- **CVE-2005-2969:** chain: SSL/TLS implementation disables a verification step (CWE-325) that enables a downgrade attack to a weaker protocol.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-287: Improper Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nWhen an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nauthentification: An alternate term is \"authentification\", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.\nAuthN: \"AuthN\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authentication\" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from \"AuthZ,\" which is an abbreviation of \"authorization.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\nAuthC: \"AuthC\" is used as an abbreviation of \"authentication,\" but it appears to used less frequently than \"AuthN.\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10.

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** Sensitive information could include data that is sensitive in and of itself (such as credentials or private messages), or otherwise useful in the further exploitation of the system (such as internal file system structure).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe authentication algorithm is sound, but the implemented mechanism can be bypassed as the result of a separate weakness that is primary to the authentication error.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Most \"authentication bypass\" errors are resultant, not primary.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-1374:** The provided password is only compared against the first character of the real password.\n- **CVE-2000-0979:** The password is not properly checked, which allows remote attackers to bypass access controls by sending a 1-byte password that matches the first character of the real password.\n- **CVE-2001-0088:** Chain: Forum software does not properly initialize an array, which inadvertently sets the password to a single character, allowing remote attackers to easily guess the password and gain administrative privileges.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nAccording to WASC, \"Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization.\"\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nCanPrecede -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30018:** A messaging platform serializes all elements of User/Group objects, making private information available to adversaries\n- **CVE-2022-29959:** Initialization file contains credentials that can be decoded using a \"simple string transformation\"\n- **CVE-2022-35411:** Python-based RPC framework enables pickle functionality by default, allowing clients to unpickle untrusted data.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany communication channels can be \"sniffed\" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.\n\n\nApplicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.\n\n\nWhen full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to \"sniff\" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information. \n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-311\nChildOf -> CWE-311\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
