Specially-crafted configuration values can lead to **memory corruption**, **information disclosure** and denial of service. An attacker can modify a configuration value and then execute an XCMD to trigger these vulnerabilities.This vulnerability arises from **format string injection** via the `default_key_id` and `key` configuration parameters, as used within the `testWifiAP` XCMD handler\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'format string injection'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1. CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String (Score: 1181.98)\n\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source....\n\n### 2. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 445.09)\n\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to st...\n\n### 3. CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') (Score: 443.74)\n\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component....\n\n### 4. CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection') (Score: 423.93)\n\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string....\n\n### 5.
