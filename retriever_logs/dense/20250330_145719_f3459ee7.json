Due to **improper validation of the request** while signing a worker node CSR (certificate signing request) Talos control plane node might issue Talos API certificate which allows full access to Talos API on a control plane node. Accessing Talos API with full level access on a control plane node might reveal sensitive information which allows full level access to the cluster (Kubernetes and Talos PKI, etc.). Talos API join token is stored in the machine configuration on the worker node. When configured correctly, Kubernetes workloads dont have access to the machine configuration, but due to a misconfiguration workload might access the machine configuration and reveal the join token. This problem has been fixed in Talos 1.2.2. Enabling the Pod Security Standards mitigates the vulnerability by denying hostPath mounts and host networking by default in the baseline policy. Clusters that dont run untrusted workloads are not affected. Clusters with correct Pod Security configurations which dont allow hostPath mounts, and secure access to cloud metadata server (or machine configuration is not supplied via cloud metadata server) are not affected.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **improper validation of the request**\n- **impact:** issue Talos API certificate which allows full access to Talos API on a control plane node\n- **product:** Talos\n- **version:** prior to 1.2.2\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n- The Talos control plane node's `trustd` API, used by worker nodes to request certificates for the `apid` service, lacked proper validation of the certificate signing requests (CSRs).\n- Specifically, the API would sign any CSR presented to it, including those maliciously crafted to gain elevated access.\n- The join token of a worker node is used to protect access to the `trustd` API.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n- **Insufficient CSR Validation:** The `trustd` API did not validate the type of certificate being requested in the CSR, allowing a worker node to request and receive a certificate that is valid for client authentication and has full access to the Talos API via the `os:admin` role.\n- **Improper Trust Boundary:** The trust boundary between worker and control plane nodes was not correctly enforced, enabling a compromised worker node to escalate privileges on the control plane.\n- **Misconfigured Kubernetes Environment:**  A misconfigured Kubernetes environment can allow workloads to access the join token of a worker node. This join token is stored in the machine configuration on the worker node.\n- **`hostPath` mount vulnerability:** If a Kubernetes workload can use a `hostPath` mount to access the machine configuration directly from the host filesystem, the join token can be read.\n- **Cloud metadata vulnerability:** If machine config is stored in the cloud metadata server and the cloud metadata server doesn't provide enough protection to prevent access from non-host workloads, a workload can read the join token from there.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- A malicious workload, if able to access the worker node's join token and then construct a specific kind of Talos CSR, could obtain a privileged certificate from the control plane.\n- With this privileged certificate, the attacker could gain full access to the Talos API on a control plane node.\n- Full access to the Talos API could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information including Kubernetes and Talos PKI, which could lead to full-level access to the cluster.\n- This could result in a complete compromise of the Kubernetes and Talos cluster.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- The primary attack vector is through a compromised Kubernetes workload running on a Talos worker node.\n- This workload must gain access to the worker node's join token and then be able to make calls to the Talos `trustd` API to request certificates for `apid`.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- The attacker needs to be able to run a workload within a Kubernetes cluster.\n- The attacker needs a misconfigured Kubernetes environment which allows access to the join token of the worker node.\n- The attacker needs to be able to craft a specific Talos CSR to get a privileged certificate.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- The vulnerability is fixed in Talos version 1.2.2.\n- The fix involves modifying the `trustd` API to prevent the signing of client authentication certificates.\n- The vulnerability can be mitigated by enabling Pod Security Standards which deny `hostPath` mounts and host networking by default.\n- Clusters not running untrusted workloads or with correct Pod Security configurations are not affected.\n\n**CVSS Metrics:**\n\nThe CVSS metrics differ slightly between the two advisories. The first advisory has CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, while the second advisory has CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N. The main difference is in Attack Vector (Network vs Local) and Scope (Unchanged vs Changed).\n\nThe first CVSS score states the attack vector is network which is technically true as it involves sending a request to the API over a network. However the attacker's initial access is local within the worker node, where the vulnerability lies in accessing the join token.\nThe second CVSS score better reflects the local attack vector and scope change because the compromise of a worker node leads to the compromise of the control plane.\n\nThe core vulnerability is the lack of CSR validation and the ability for worker nodes to request admin-level client certificates and is correctly reflected by the second CVSS score.\n\nThis information is more detailed than the typical CVE description, which is a summary.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 1.276 |\n| 2 | 923 | Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 1.037 |\n| 3 | 532 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File | Base | Allowed | sparse | 1.010 |\n| 4 | 306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.993 |\n| 5 | 668 | Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.986 |\n| 6 | 277 | Insecure Inherited Permissions | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.423 |\n| 7 | 322 | Key Exchange without Entity Authentication | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.969 |\n| 9 | 1390 | Weak Authentication | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.955 |\n| 10 | 295 | Improper Certificate Validation | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.947 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.\n- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default \"Allow\" configuration for its authorization settings.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAttackers might be able to spoof the intended endpoint from a different system or process, thus gaining the same level of access as the intended endpoint.\n\n\nWhile this issue frequently involves authentication between network-based clients and servers, other types of communication channels and endpoints can have this weakness.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30319:** S-bus functionality in a home automation product performs access control using an IP allowlist, which can be bypassed by a forged IP address.\n- **CVE-2022-22547:** A troubleshooting tool exposes a web server on a random port between 9000-65535 that could be used for information gathering\n- **CVE-2022-4390:** A WAN interface on a router has firewall restrictions enabled for IPv4, but it does not for IPv6, which is enabled by default\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product writes sensitive information to a log file.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-538\nChildOf -> CWE-200\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2017-9615:** verbose logging stores admin credentials in a world-readable log file\n- **CVE-2018-1999036:** SSH password for private key stored in build log\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

For example, a program may intend that private files can only be provided to a specific user. This effectively defines a control sphere that is intended to prevent attackers from accessing these private files. If the file permissions are insecure, then parties other than the user will be able to access those files.\n\n\nA separate control sphere might effectively require that the user can only access the private files, but not any other files on the system. If the program does not ensure that the user is only requesting private files, then the user might be able to access other files on the system.\n\n\nIn either case, the end result is that a resource has been exposed to the wrong party.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-664\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Theoretical]** A \"control sphere\" is a set of resources and behaviors that are accessible to a single actor, or a group of actors. A product's security model will typically define multiple spheres, possibly implicitly. For example, a server might define one sphere for \"administrators\" who can create new user accounts with subdirectories under /home/server/, and a second sphere might cover the set of users who can create or delete files within their own subdirectories. A third sphere might be \"users who are authenticated to the operating system on which the product is installed.\" Each sphere has different sets of actors and allowable behaviors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-277: Insecure Inherited Permissions\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA product defines a set of insecure permissions that are inherited by objects that are created by the program.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-732\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This may enable an attacker to impersonate an actor by modifying traffic between the two entities. Typically, this involves a victim client that contacts a malicious server that is impersonating a trusted server. If the client skips authentication or ignores an authentication failure, the malicious server may request authentication information from the user. The malicious server can then use this authentication information to log in to the trusted server using the victim's credentials, sniff traffic between the victim and trusted server, etc.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-306\nCanPrecede -> CWE-923\nPeerOf -> CWE-295\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
