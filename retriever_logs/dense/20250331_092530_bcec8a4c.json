This function, when used incorrectly, allows attackers to perform absolute path traversal.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The primary weakness is path traversal. The applications fail to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `filename` parameter, before passing it to the `send_file` function. This allows an attacker to manipulate the filename to access files outside of the intended web root.\n*   **Unvalidated Input:**  The lack of input validation is a major contributor. The application code does not check that the supplied filename is within the allowed path, which could be within a specific directory or directories.\n*   **Use of `os.path.join`:** Several of the descriptions also point out a related issue with `os.path.join`. When an absolute path is passed to `os.path.join`, it discards the preceding path components, creating an opportunity for path traversal.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Confidentiality breach:** Attackers can read sensitive files, including source code, configuration files, database files or any files accessible to the webserver user.\n*   **Potential for limited Availability impact**:  Attackers can make multiple requests for accessing huge files such as a database leading to a partial system denial of service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network-based:** The attack vector is over the network. Attackers can send crafted HTTP requests with malicious path strings to the vulnerable endpoints.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **No Authentication Required:**  The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication, allowing any remote attacker to potentially gain unauthorized access to files.\n*   **No User Interaction Required:** The attack does not require any interaction from users of the application.\n*   **Basic Knowledge of HTTP Requests:** Attackers need a basic knowledge of how to send HTTP requests.\n\n**Specifics related to CVE-2022-31510:**\n\n*   **Affected Repository:**  The specific repository affected by CVE-2022-31510 is `sergeKashkin/Simple-RAT`.\n*   **Vulnerable Code:** The vulnerable code is located within the `server\\RAT_server.py` file and has been fixed in commit `6ea772d`.\n*   **Remediation:** The vulnerability can be resolved by using `werkzeug.utils.safe_join` or by using `flask.send_from_directory` rather than `flask.send_file`.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n\n*   **Reference to `github/securitylab#669`**: This issue is cited as a common reference point across all advisories which indicates that all vulnerabilities mentioned are a part of a wider investigation into the misuse of the `send_file` function in Flask applications.\n*   **Use of CodeQL:**  The vulnerability was discovered using CodeQL (static code analysis tool) by GitHub.\n*   **CVSS Score:**  The CVSS scores of 9.3 for most of the listed CVEs signifies a critical severity, and for CVE-2022-31566 a high severity of 8.6, and 7.5 for CVE-2022-31578.\n\n**Summary of Other CVEs:**\n\nThe other CVEs (CVE-2022-31504, CVE-2022-31505, CVE-2022-31509, CVE-2022-31511, CVE-2022-31512, CVE-2022-31513, CVE-2022-31514, CVE-2022-31515, CVE-2022-31516, CVE-2022-31518, CVE-2022-31520, CVE-2022-31521, CVE-2022-31526, CVE-2022-31527, CVE-2022-31528, CVE-2022-31532, CVE-2022-31533, CVE-2022-31534, CVE-2022-31535, CVE-2022-31536, CVE-2022-31537, CVE-2022-31538, CVE-2022-31540, CVE-2022-31544, CVE-2022-31545, CVE-2022-31546, CVE-2022-31547, CVE-2022-31548, CVE-2022-31551, CVE-2022-31552, CVE-2022-31553, CVE-2022-31554, CVE-2022-31555, CVE-2022-31556, CVE-2022-31557, CVE-2022-31559, CVE-2022-31560, CVE-2022-31561, CVE-2022-31562, CVE-2022-31563, CVE-2022-31564, CVE-2022-31565, CVE-2022-31566, CVE-2022-31567, CVE-2022-31568, CVE-2022-31570, CVE-2022-31571, CVE-2022-31572, CVE-2022-31574, CVE-2022-31575, CVE-2022-31576, CVE-2022-31577, CVE-2022-31578, CVE-2022-31579, CVE-2022-31582, CVE-2022-31583, CVE-2022-31585, CVE-2022-31587, and CVE-2022-31588 ) all share the same root cause and weaknesses which is the insecure use of the `flask.send_file` function, leading to path traversal vulnerabilities. They differ in the affected repositories and may have small variations in their descriptions.\n\nIn summary, the core vulnerability is an exploitable path traversal in Flask applications due to the unsafe use of `send_file`, often combined with insecure path manipulation. This poses a critical risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | Base | Allowed | alternate_terms | 0.800 |\n| 2 | 36 | Absolute Path Traversal | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.368 |\n| 3 | 73 | External Control of File Name or Path | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.207 |\n| 4 | 23 | Relative Path Traversal | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.148 |\n| 5 | 37 | Path Traversal: '/absolute/pathname/here' | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.133 |\n| 6 | 24 | Path Traversal: '../filedir' | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.524 |\n| 7 | 59 | Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 95 | Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection') | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.124 |\n| 9 | 38 | Path Traversal: '\\absolute\\pathname\\here' | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.119 |\n| 10 | 39 | Path Traversal: 'C:dirname' | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.109 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDirectory traversal\nPath traversal: \"Path traversal\" is preferred over \"directory traversal,\" but both terms are attack-focused.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add \".txt\" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.\n\n**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.\n\n**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing \"/\" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nLike other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use \"directory traversal\" only to refer to the injection of \"..\" and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.\n\n\nOther variants like \"absolute pathname\" and \"drive letter\" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve \"..\" or equivalent.\n\n\n**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.\n\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nIncomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that \"..\\\" is vulnerable, but not test \"../\" which may also be vulnerable.\n\n\nAny combination of directory separators (\"/\", \"\\\", etc.) and numbers of \".\" (e.g. \"....\") can produce unique variants; for example, the \"//../\" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama\n- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the \"\\\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as \"/abs/path\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-22\nChildOf -> CWE-22\nChildOf -> CWE-22\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-31503:** Python package constructs filenames using an unsafe os.path.join call on untrusted input, allowing absolute path traversal because os.path.join resets the pathname to an absolute path that is specified as part of the input.\n- **CVE-2002-1345:** Multiple FTP clients write arbitrary files via absolute paths in server responses\n- **CVE-2001-1269:** ZIP file extractor allows full path\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis could allow an attacker to access or modify system files or other files that are critical to the application.\n\n\nPath manipulation errors occur when the following two conditions are met:\n\n```\n\t\t1. An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.\n\t\t2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.\n```\nFor example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-642\nChildOf -> CWE-610\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-22\nCanPrecede -> CWE-41\nCanPrecede -> CWE-98\nCanPrecede -> CWE-434\nCanPrecede -> CWE-59\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** CWE-114 is a Class, but it is listed a child of CWE-73 in view 1000. This suggests some abstraction problems that should be resolved in future versions.\n\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThe external control of filenames can be the primary link in chains with other file-related weaknesses, as seen in the CanPrecede relationships. This is because software systems use files for many different purposes: to execute programs, load code libraries, to store application data, to store configuration settings, record temporary data, act as signals or semaphores to other processes, etc.\n\n\nHowever, those weaknesses do not always require external control. For example, link-following weaknesses (CWE-59) often involve pathnames that are not controllable by the attacker at all.\n\n\nThe external control can be resultant from other issues. For example, in PHP applications, the register_globals setting can allow an attacker to modify variables that the programmer thought were immutable, enabling file inclusion (CWE-98) and path traversal (CWE-22). Operating with excessive privileges (CWE-250) might allow an attacker to specify an input filename that is not directly readable by the attacker, but is accessible to the privileged program. A buffer overflow (CWE-119) might give an attacker control over nearby memory locations that are related to pathnames, but were not directly modifiable by the attacker.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n- **CVE-2008-5748:** Chain: external control of values for user's desired language and theme enables path traversal.\n- **CVE-2008-5764:** Chain: external control of user's target language enables remote file inclusion.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nZip Slip: \"Zip slip\" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282]. It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-22\nChildOf -> CWE-22\nChildOf -> CWE-22\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
