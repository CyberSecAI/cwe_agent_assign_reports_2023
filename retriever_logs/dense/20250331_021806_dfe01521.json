This leads to a race condition.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **CWE-662 Improper Synchronization:** The core issue is a lack of proper synchronization mechanisms when accessing shared resources within the vcu, leading to a race condition.\n- **Use-after-free:** The race condition can result in a use-after-free vulnerability, where memory is accessed after it has been deallocated.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Local Escalation of Privilege (EoP):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain elevated privileges on the affected device.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Local:** The vulnerability is exploitable locally, meaning the attacker needs to have some form of access to the device.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to have some ability to execute code on the device, and must have system privileges to exploit the vulnerability.\n- User interaction is not required.\n\n**Affected Chipsets:**\n- MT6762, MT6768, MT6779, MT6781, MT6785, MT6789, MT6833, MT6853, MT6853T, MT6855, MT6873, MT6875, MT6877, MT6879, MT6883, MT6885, MT6889, MT6891, MT6893, MT6895, MT6983, MT8168, MT8185, MT8365, MT8696, MT8768, MT8786, MT8789, MT8791, MT8797, MT8798\n\n**Affected Software Versions:**\n- Android 11.0, 12.0, 13.0\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') | Class | Allowed-with-Review | alternate_terms | 1.000 |\n| 2 | 662 | Improper Synchronization | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.449 |\n| 3 | 667 | Improper Locking | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.348 |\n| 4 | 413 | Improper Resource Locking | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.312 |\n| 5 | 367 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.312 |\n| 6 | 421 | Race Condition During Access to Alternate Channel | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.580 |\n| 7 | 609 | Double-Checked Locking | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 366 | Race Condition within a Thread | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.295 |\n| 9 | 131 | Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.293 |\n| 10 | 416 | Use After Free | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.288 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nA race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.\n\n\nA race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:\n\n\n  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.\n\n  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.\n\nA race condition exists when an \"interfering code sequence\" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.\n\nThe interfering code sequence could be \"trusted\" or \"untrusted.\" A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nRace Condition\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-691\nCanPrecede -> CWE-416\nCanPrecede -> CWE-476\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed. They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.\n\n**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nSynchronization refers to a variety of behaviors and mechanisms that allow two or more independently-operating processes or threads to ensure that they operate on shared resources in predictable ways that do not interfere with each other. Some shared resource operations cannot be executed atomically; that is, multiple steps must be guaranteed to execute sequentially, without any interference by other processes. Synchronization mechanisms vary widely, but they may include locking, mutexes, and semaphores. When a multi-step operation on a shared resource cannot be guaranteed to execute independent of interference, then the resulting behavior can be unpredictable. Improper synchronization could lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-664\nChildOf -> CWE-691\nCanPrecede -> CWE-362\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms. Multiple entries are dependent on this research, which includes relationships to concurrency, race conditions, reentrant functions, etc. CWE-662 and its children - including CWE-667, CWE-820, CWE-821, and others - may need to be modified significantly, along with their relationships.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2009-0935:** Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nLocking is a type of synchronization behavior that ensures that multiple independently-operating processes or threads do not interfere with each other when accessing the same resource. All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms.

This might violate the product's assumption that the resource will not change, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-667\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-20141:** Chain: an operating system kernel has insufficent resource locking (CWE-413) leading to a use after free (CWE-416).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nTOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to \"Time Of Check To Time Of Use\".\nTOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-362\nChildOf -> CWE-362\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** TOCTOU issues do not always involve symlinks, and not every symlink issue is a TOCTOU problem.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Non-symlink TOCTOU issues are not reported frequently, but they are likely to occur in code that attempts to be secure.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2015-1743:** TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed\n- **CVE-2003-0813:** A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.\n- **CVE-2004-0594:** PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-421: Race Condition During Access to Alternate Channel\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product opens an alternate channel to communicate with an authorized user, but the channel is accessible to other actors.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis creates a race condition that allows an attacker to access the channel before the authorized user does.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-420\nChildOf -> CWE-362\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-0351:** FTP \"Pizza Thief\" vulnerability. Attacker can connect to a port that was intended for use by another client.\n- **CVE-2003-0230:** Product creates Windows named pipe during authentication that another attacker can hijack by connecting to it.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-609: Double-Checked Locking\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses double-checked locking to access a resource without the overhead of explicit synchronization, but the locking is insufficient.\n\n### Extended Description\nDouble-checked locking refers to the situation where a programmer checks to see if a resource has been initialized, grabs a lock, checks again to see if the resource has been initialized, and then performs the initialization if it has not occurred yet. This should not be done, as it is not guaranteed to work in all languages and on all architectures. In summary, other threads may not be operating inside the synchronous block and are not guaranteed to see the operations execute in the same order as they would appear inside the synchronous block.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-667\nCanPrecede -> CWE-367\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-362\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-2621:** Chain: two threads in a web browser use the same resource (CWE-366), but one of those threads can destroy the resource before the other has completed (CWE-416).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** \n\nThis is a broad category. Some examples include:\n\n\n  - simple math errors,\n\n  - incorrectly updating parallel counters,\n\n  - not accounting for size differences when \"transforming\" one input to another format (e.g. URL canonicalization or other transformation that can generate a result that's larger than the original input, i.e. \"expansion\").\n\nThis level of detail is rarely available in public reports, so it is difficult to find good examples.\n\n**[Maintenance]** \n\nThis weakness may be a composite or a chain. It also may contain layering or perspective differences.\n\n\nThis issue may be associated with many different types of incorrect calculations (CWE-682), although the integer overflow (CWE-190) is probably the most prevalent. This can be primary to resource consumption problems (CWE-400), including uncontrolled memory allocation (CWE-789). However, its relationship with out-of-bounds buffer access (CWE-119) must also be considered.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-17087:** Chain: integer truncation (CWE-197) causes small buffer allocation (CWE-131) leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) in kernel pool, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2004-1363:** substitution overflow: buffer overflow using environment variables that are expanded after the length check is performed\n- **CVE-2004-0747:** substitution overflow: buffer overflow using expansion of environment variables\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-416: Use After Free\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory \"belongs\" to the code that operates on the new pointer.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDangling pointer: a pointer that no longer points to valid memory, often after it has been freed\nUAF: commonly used acronym for Use After Free\nUse-After-Free\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-825\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nCanPrecede -> CWE-120\nCanPrecede -> CWE-123\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-20141:** Chain: an operating system kernel has insufficent resource locking (CWE-413) leading to a use after free (CWE-416).\n- **CVE-2022-2621:** Chain: two threads in a web browser use the same resource (CWE-366), but one of those threads can destroy the resource before the other has completed (CWE-416).\n- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n",
