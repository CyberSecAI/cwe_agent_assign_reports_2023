CWE-639 is a more specific case of CWE-863 where the bypass occurs through a user-controlled key.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe1220[\"CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe1220 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe639,cwe1220 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper** implementation of field-level access control for `multiselect` fields, leading to the bypass of authorization checks. This results in unauthorized data modification or compromised data confidentiality.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **incorrect** application of field-level access control. The CVE description and reference links clearly indicate that the `multiselect` fields in `@keystone-6/core` versions 2.2.0 to 2.3.0 do not properly enforce access controls, allowing unauthorized data modification.\n\nThe selection of CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) as the primary CWE is based on the fact that the product performs an authorization check, but it does not correctly perform the check. The evidence for this is: \"users who expected their `multiselect` fields to use the field-level access control - if configured - are vulnerable to their field-level access control not being used\".\n\nCWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) was considered as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability could be exploited by manipulating the field data, potentially acting as a key. However, evidence is insufficient to claim that this is a primary means of exploiting the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-1220 (Insufficient Granularity of Access Control) was also considered as the field-level access controls for `multiselect` fields were **not properly applied**.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity. CWE-863 captures the general **incorrect** authorization, while CWE-639 and CWE-1220 represent more specific potential exploitation methods. The confidence level is high because the evidence clearly supports the chosen classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n*CWE-668 was considered but not selected. The Rationale is that it is too high level.*\n\n## CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an externally controlled name or reference that resolves to a resource that is outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*CWE-610 was considered but not selected. The Rationale is that it is too high level.*\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*CWE-538 was considered but not selected. The Vulnerability Description doesn't support this CWE.*\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*CWE-497 was considered but not selected. The Vulnerability Description doesn't support this CWE.*\n\n## CWE-669: Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly transfer a resource/behavior to another sphere, or improperly imports a resource/behavior from another sphere, in a manner that provides unintended control over that resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*CWE-669 was considered but not selected. The Vulnerability Description doesn't support this CWE.*\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*CWE-552 was considered but not selected. The Vulnerability Description doesn't support this CWE.*\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*CWE-653 was considered but not selected. The Vulnerability Description doesn't support this CWE.*\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n*CWE-664 was considered but not selected. The Rationale is that it is too high level.*\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the",
