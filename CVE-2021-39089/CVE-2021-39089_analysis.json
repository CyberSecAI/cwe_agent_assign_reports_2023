Also, CWE-319 is a potential weakness given the possibility that the sensitive information might be transmitted in cleartext.\nThe choice of CWE-200 is influenced by the vulnerability description explicitly mentioning \"obtain sensitive information.\" However, the mapping guidance discourages direct usage of CWE-200 because it describes a technical impact rather than a root cause. The selection of CWE-201 and CWE-319 attempts to provide more specific base-level causes.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe319 -->|PEEROF| cwe201\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe201,cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a specially crafted HTTP request leading to the exposure of sensitive information.\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** Improper handling of a specially crafted HTTP request.\n2.  **Weakness:** Insertion of sensitive information into sent data (CWE-201), or cleartext transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319).\n3.  **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information to an authenticated user (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment indicated CWE-200 as a likely candidate due to the explicit mention of \"obtain sensitive information\". However, the mapping guidance for CWE-200 discourages its direct use as it represents a technical impact rather than a root cause. Consequently, the analysis was refined to include CWE-201 and CWE-319, which are more specific base-level weaknesses related to the insertion and transmission of sensitive data, respectively.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision is derived from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" which indicates \"**impact:** obtain sensitive information\" and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which mentions \"The system does not properly handle crafted HTTP requests, leading to exposure of sensitive information.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the parent-child relationship between CWE-200 and CWE-201, allowing for a more granular classification. CWE-319 was considered due to its relevance to potential cleartext transmission, but it is less directly supported by the provided evidence.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an optimal level of specificity, balancing the need to identify the root cause with the available evidence. CWE-201 and CWE-319 offer more actionable insights compared to the broader CWE-200.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
