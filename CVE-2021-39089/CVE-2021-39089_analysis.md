# Analysis for CVE-2021-39089

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.8 | Class | Primary | Discouraged |
| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship impacting the decision is the hierarchical relationship between CWE-200 (Class) and CWE-201 (Base), where CWE-201 is a child of CWE-200. Also, CWE-319 is a potential weakness given the possibility that the sensitive information might be transmitted in cleartext.
The choice of CWE-200 is influenced by the vulnerability description explicitly mentioning "obtain sensitive information." However, the mapping guidance discourages direct usage of CWE-200 because it describes a technical impact rather than a root cause. The selection of CWE-201 and CWE-319 attempts to provide more specific base-level causes.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a specially crafted HTTP request leading to the exposure of sensitive information.

1.  **Root Cause:** Improper handling of a specially crafted HTTP request.
2.  **Weakness:** Insertion of sensitive information into sent data (CWE-201), or cleartext transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319).
3.  **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information to an authenticated user (CWE-200).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment indicated CWE-200 as a likely candidate due to the explicit mention of "obtain sensitive information". However, the mapping guidance for CWE-200 discourages its direct use as it represents a technical impact rather than a root cause. Consequently, the analysis was refined to include CWE-201 and CWE-319, which are more specific base-level weaknesses related to the insertion and transmission of sensitive data, respectively.

The evidence supporting this decision is derived from the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" which indicates "**impact:** obtain sensitive information" and the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" which mentions "The system does not properly handle crafted HTTP requests, leading to exposure of sensitive information."

The graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the parent-child relationship between CWE-200 and CWE-201, allowing for a more granular classification. CWE-319 was considered due to its relevance to potential cleartext transmission, but it is less directly supported by the provided evidence.

The selected CWEs are at an optimal level of specificity, balancing the need to identify the root cause with the available evidence. CWE-201 and CWE-319 offer more actionable insights compared to the broader CWE-200.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.
