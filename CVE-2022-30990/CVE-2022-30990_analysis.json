While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which \"permissions\" are not checked. |\n| CWE-276 | Incorrect Default Permissions | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. This CWE describes the scenario where file permissions are set incorrectly during installation, allowing unauthorized modification. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-732, which is a class-level CWE. CWE-276, Incorrect Default Permissions, is a child of CWE-732, representing a more specific case of incorrect permission assignment during installation. This hierarchical relationship helps refine the classification, suggesting that if more details were available about the specific scenario, CWE-276 might be a better fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe276[\"CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions\"]\n    cwe276 -->|CHILDOF| cwe732\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe732 primary\n    class cwe276 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with the **insecure folder permissions** (root cause) which leads to sensitive information being accessible (impact).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates that sensitive information disclosure occurs due to **insecure folder permissions**.\n\nThe primary CWE selection is CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource). The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"insecure folder permissions,\" which directly aligns with CWE-732's description: \"The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.\" This CWE is a Class, and the mapping guidance suggests that lower-level CWEs might be more appropriate.\n\nCWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions) was considered as a more specific Base CWE. It describes a scenario where file permissions are incorrectly set during installation. While the vulnerability description doesn't explicitly mention installation, it's a plausible scenario. Thus, it's a secondary candidate.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not chosen:\n*   CWE-61 and CWE-59: These involve symbolic links, which are not mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n*   CWE-285: Improper Authorization is a high-level class, and CWE-732 is a more specific child.\n*   CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials, while related to sensitive information, doesn't directly address the permission issue.\n*   CWE-1272: Sensitive Information Uncleared Before Debug/Power State Transition is not relevant to the **insecure folder permissions**.\n*   CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element is not relevant to the **insecure folder permissions**.\n*   CWE-378 Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions is not relevant to the **insecure folder permissions**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-732 is based on the direct mention of \"insecure folder permissions\" in the vulnerability description, making it the most appropriate initial classification. Further investigation might reveal if CWE-276 is applicable. The confidence level is high due to the clear alignment between the vulnerability description and the CWE definition.",
