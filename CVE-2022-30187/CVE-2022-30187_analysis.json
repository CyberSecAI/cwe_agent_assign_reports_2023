The retriever suggested CWE-311 as a possibility, which is also a Class-level CWE and a child of CWE-693. While it is not possible to determine the exact cause of the Information Disclosure with the evidence provided, the best fit is a general Exposure of Information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    \n    cwe311 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe311 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of root cause and weaknesses that followed for the Vulnerability Description:\n  - The **root cause** is **unknown** given the limited information in the description.\n  - The **weakness** is **information disclosure**.\n  - The **impact** is an **unauthorized actor** gaining access to sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates an \"Information Disclosure Vulnerability\" in the Azure Storage Library. However, it does not provide sufficient technical details to pinpoint the root cause. The key phrase \"Information Disclosure\" points towards a confidentiality breach, but without more specifics, the most appropriate CWE is a high-level one:\n\n*   **Initial Analysis:** The description lacks the specific cause of the vulnerability, making it challenging to select a precise CWE.\n*   **CWE Selection:**\n    *   **CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor):** This is a general Class-level CWE that fits the description of information disclosure. However, it is discouraged as a primary mapping because it describes the impact rather than the root cause.\n    *   **CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data):** This is a Class-level CWE that could potentially be a contributing factor if the information was not encrypted. However, there is no direct evidence to support this.\n*   **Final Conclusion:** Due to the limited information, CWE-200 is chosen as the primary CWE to represent the information disclosure aspect. However, the confidence is not high due to the lack of information of what caused the Information Disclosure.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.

In fact, it should be noted that recoverable encrypted passwords provide no significant benefit over plaintext passwords since they are subject not only to reuse by malicious attackers but also by malicious insiders. If a system administrator can recover a password directly, or use a brute force search on the available information, the administrator can use the password on other accounts.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 5865.58\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may\n         become a very small or negative number.",
