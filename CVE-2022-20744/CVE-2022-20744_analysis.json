CWE-807's parent is CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure. CWE-280 and CWE-863 are related to authorization. CWE-285 is a parent of CWE-863 and child of CWE-284. The Mermaid diagram illustrates these relationships.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe807[\"CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    cwe280[\"CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe807 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe807 primary\n    class cwe280,cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe693,cwe285,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of a specific input**. An attacker can then modify this input, which leads to a bypass of the protection mechanism and ultimately allows the attacker to **view data without proper authorization**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-807 as the primary weakness, due to the vulnerability description key phrases highlighting a \"**protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of a specific input**\" and the ability to bypass it by modifying the input. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-807: \"The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\"\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary further supports this, stating: \"The vulnerability exists due to a flaw in the input protection mechanism, where it relies on the existence or values of a specific input. An attacker can bypass this mechanism by modifying this input.\"\n\nCWE-807 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\nCWE-280, **Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges**, was considered because the impact involves viewing data without proper authorization, potentially related to insufficient privileges. However, the root cause is more directly tied to the **reliance on a modifiable input** rather than a permissions issue. So it's less directly involved.\n\nCWE-863, **Incorrect Authorization**, was also considered, but the vulnerability stems from the initial reliance on an untrusted input, making CWE-807 a more accurate representation of the root cause.\n\nThe selection of CWE-807 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause, which is the flawed protection mechanism based on modifiable inputs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
