This indicates a clear hierarchical relationship where CWE-321 is a specific type of CWE-798. The relationship influences the selection by ensuring the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability is chosen.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe321 primary\n    class cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a **hard-coded cryptographic key** (CWE-321) leading to the potential **disclosure or tampering of sensitive information**. The root cause is the hard-coded key, while the impact is information disclosure and tampering.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis clearly points to the use of a **hard-coded cryptographic key** as the root cause of the vulnerability, as stated in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section explicitly mentions \"**Root Cause of Vulnerability: Use of a hard-coded cryptographic key**\" and \"**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present: Hard-coded cryptographic key (CWE-321) is used within the software**\".\n\nCWE-321 is the optimal level of specificity because it accurately reflects the use of a cryptographic key, as opposed to a more generic credential like a password. The evidence directly supports this classification, and the MITRE mapping guidance allows for the use of Variant-level CWEs.\n\nCWE-798 was considered but selected as a secondary candidate since it is a more general case of **hard-coded credentials**. While applicable, it does not provide the specificity of CWE-321.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 6061.90\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe use of a **hard-coded cryptographic key** significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-656\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-798\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.50\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains **hard-coded credentials**, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-321\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-671\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-344",
