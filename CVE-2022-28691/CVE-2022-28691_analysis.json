CWE-400 is a class-level CWE that describes uncontrolled resource consumption. The relationships show a clear path from resource allocation without limits (CWE-770) leading to uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400). Since CWE-770 is more specific and accurately reflects the **root cause**, it's selected as the primary CWE, with CWE-400 as a secondary consideration.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **allocation of resources without limits or throttling** (CWE-770). This leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400), which ultimately results in an increase in Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) resource utilization.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which indicates that undisclosed traffic can cause an increase in TMM resource utilization when an RTSP profile is configured.\n\nThe description suggests that the application **fails to limit or throttle the resources allocated** to handle the traffic, leading to a resource exhaustion issue.\n\nThe selection of CWE-770 is primarily influenced by the fact that it represents the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description points to a scenario where resources are allocated without proper limits, aligning with CWE-770's definition.\n\nThe relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the connection between the root cause (CWE-770) and the resulting impact (CWE-400). CWE-770 is the more specific and appropriate choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
