While CWE-522 is a class, the provided information strongly indicates that the **insufficient protection of the global private key** is the core weakness. The use of a global key, while contributing to the severity, is a consequence of this **insufficient protection**. CWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength) is considered as a potential secondary weakness since it is possible that the private key protection mechanism uses a theoretically sound encryption that is not strong enough for the level of protection required.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe326[\"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weaknesses in Authentication or Authorization Protocol\"]\n\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe326 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe522 primary\n    class cwe326 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **insufficient protection of the global private key** (CWE-522 or potentially a more specific child). This leads to the possibility of an attacker discovering the private key. Once the key is discovered, it can be used to extract confidential configuration data and perform attacks against legacy PG/PC and HMI communication.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is heavily based on the vulnerability description, which clearly states the **root cause** as **\"insufficient protection of global private key.\"** The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by highlighting the \"Insufficient Key Protection\" as the primary weakness. The Retriever Results also strongly suggest CWE-522 as the most relevant CWE. Given this evidence, CWE-522 is the most appropriate primary mapping.\n\nCWE-326 is included as a possible secondary CWE, due to the mention of the protection of confidential configuration data.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the parent-child relationships of CWE-522 and CWE-326. The decision to select CWE-522 at the Class level is justified by the lack of sufficient evidence to pinpoint a more specific Base or Variant.\nThe selection of CWE-522 and CWE-326 is at the optimal level of specificity given the available information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
