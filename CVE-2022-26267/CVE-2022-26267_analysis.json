It is a child of CWE-200. CWE-425 is related to missing authorization and could potentially precede CWE-359 if the missing authorization leads to information exposure. The relationship is that **IMPROPER AUTHORIZATION** can lead to **INFORMATION EXPOSURE**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    \n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe425 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe359\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe359 primary\n    class cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves a direct request to a resource (`/admin/maintenance_actions.php?action=...`) that leads to an **information leak**.\n\n1.  **Direct Request:** An unauthorized direct request is made to a specific URL.\n2.  **Information Leak:** The direct request bypasses intended access controls, leading to the exposure of sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-359 as the primary candidate due to the direct **impact** of the vulnerability being an **information leak**. The vulnerability description mentions an information leak via the `action` parameter in `/admin/maintenance_actions.php`. This aligns with the definition of CWE-359: \"The product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected.\"\n\nThe secondary candidate, CWE-425, was considered because the description suggests a **missing authorization** issue that allows for direct requests to restricted URLs. This aligns with the definition of CWE-425: \"The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\" If the application *should* have authorization checks in place but does not, it allows the information leak.\n\nThe evidence supporting CWE-359 is the explicit mention of an \"information leak\" in the vulnerability description. This directly matches the core characteristic of CWE-359.\n\nThe evidence supporting CWE-425 is the implication that the `/admin/maintenance_actions.php` endpoint should not be directly accessible without proper authorization. This is less explicit but inferred from the endpoint's location.\n\nThe relationship graph shows that CWE-425 can precede CWE-359. This means that the **missing authorization** (CWE-425) can lead to the **information exposure** (CWE-359).\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause (missing authorization) and the resulting impact (information exposure) of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-78, CWE-89, CWE-94, CWE-95 and CWE-96 were considered but not used because they describe injection vulnerabilities, and there is no evidence of injection in the description. CWE-306 was considered but not used because it focuses on missing authentication in general, whereas CWE-425 is more specific to direct requests bypassing authorization.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
