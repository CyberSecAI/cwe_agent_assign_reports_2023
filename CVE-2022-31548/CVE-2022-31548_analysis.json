This indicates a hierarchical relationship where CWE-36 is a specific type of CWE-22. CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) can precede CWE-22, suggesting that external control over the file path could lead to path traversal vulnerabilities. The choice of CWE-36 is based on the explicit mention of \"**absolute path traversal**\" in the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe36[\"CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    \n    cwe36 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe22\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe36 primary\n    class cwe22,cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **unsafe use of the Flask send_file function**, which leads to the **absolute path traversal** vulnerability. This allows an attacker to access files and directories outside the web root folder, resulting in data confidentiality loss.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified \"**absolute path traversal**\" as the main **weakness** due to the **unsafe use of the Flask send_file function**. The provided evidence and relationships support this classification.\n\nThe selection of CWE-36 is based on the direct mention of \"**absolute path traversal**\" in the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The vulnerability description states: \"The nrlakin/homepage repository through 2017-03-06 on GitHub allows **absolute path traversal** because the Flask send_file function is used unsafely.\"\n\nCWE-22 and CWE-73 were considered as broader classifications, but CWE-36 was chosen because it provides a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability. The abstraction level of Base is appropriate as it represents the fundamental flaw.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially
