It is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). Given that the description explicitly states a **missing permission check**, CWE-862 is the most appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward: The **root cause** is the **missing authorization** check (CWE-862), which leads to the **impact** of attackers being able to check whether attacker-specified file patterns match workspace contents.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identified CWE-862 as the primary CWE due to the **lack of a permission check**.\n\nThe vulnerability description states that the Jenkins Android Signing Plugin 2.2.5 and earlier **does not perform a permission check** in a method implementing form validation. This directly aligns with the description of CWE-862, which states: \"The product **does not perform an authorization check** when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating: \"**Root cause of vulnerability**: The Android Signing Plugin **does not perform a permission check** in a method implementing form validation.\"\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-862 as the top result, further supporting this classification.\n\nThe MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-862 indicates \"Allowed-with-Review\" since it is a Class and might have more specific Base-level children. However, in this case, the description is precise enough that a more specific child is not necessary. The **missing authorization** is the core issue.\n\nBased on the evidence, relationship analysis, and mapping guidance, CWE-862 is the most appropriate classification.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization): This was considered, but it implies that an authorization check is performed, but incorrectly. The vulnerability description explicitly states that **no permission check** is performed, making CWE-862 a more accurate fit.\n*   CWE-285 (Improper Authorization): This is a parent of CWE-862, but is too general. CWE-862 provides a more specific description of the vulnerability.\n*   CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource): This was considered, but it focuses on the incorrect assignment of permissions, rather than a **missing check** altogether.\n*   CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key): This was considered, but the weakness is about the authorization bypass due to user-controlled key, and not the **missing permission check**.",
