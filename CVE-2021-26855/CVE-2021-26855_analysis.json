This CWE can be a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) or CWE-913 (Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources). There are no clear chain relationships to use.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\"]\n\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe913 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability description only states that a Remote Code Execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Exchange Server. More information is needed to understand the chain of events that leads to the vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description is very brief and only states that there is a \"Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\".\n\nThe **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** show the **impact** as Remote Code Execution and the **product** as Microsoft Exchange Server.\n\nThe **CWE for similar CVE Descriptions** only shows CWE-NVD-noinfo as the Primary CWE Match, which means that the description is too generic to map to a specific CWE.\n\nThe **Retriever Results** lists CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')) as having the highest score. This CWE is related to code injection, which can lead to remote code execution. CWE-94 is listed as \"Allowed-with-Review\" because it is frequently misused. The description states \"This weakness only applies when the product's functionality intentionally constructs all or part of a code segment\".\n\nBased on the limited information available, CWE-94 appears to be the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This entry is frequently misused for vulnerabilities with a technical impact of \"code execution,\" which does not by itself indicate a root cause weakness, since dozens of weaknesses can enable code execution.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-98\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-96\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-95\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-1336\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-913",
