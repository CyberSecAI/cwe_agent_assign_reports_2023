The secondary CWE is CWE-798, which is also a Base level CWE. There are no relevant parent-child or peer relationships that influenced the primary CWE selection. CWE-798 is related to CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) via a child relationship.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe266 primary\n    class cwe798 secondary\n    class cwe259 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect privilege assignment** (CWE-266) in the authentication mechanism. This leads to the exposure of cryptographic secrets and the potential for an attacker to gain access to sensitive information and perform privileged actions. The use of potentially **hard-coded credentials** (CWE-798) may also be a contributing factor.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided evidence, specifically the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section, which states that the root cause of the vulnerability is an **incorrect privilege assignment** in the authentication mechanism. The vulnerability description mentions the exposure of cryptographic secrets, and the retriever results suggest the relevance of CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials). While it is possible that hard-coded credentials are being exposed due to the privilege issue, this is not explicitly stated in the vulnerability description. Therefore, CWE-266 is selected as the primary CWE due to the explicit mention of **incorrect privilege assignment** as the root cause. CWE-798 is added as a secondary CWE due to the possibility of hard-coded credentials being exposed as a result of the primary weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
