CWE-36 is a more specific case of CWE-22, focusing on absolute path traversal, which aligns directly with the vulnerability description. While other path traversal variants were considered, they were not as fitting as CWE-36.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe36[\"CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    \n    cwe36 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe36 primary\n    class cwe22 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events for this vulnerability is relatively simple:\n1.  The application uses the Flask send_file function unsafely.\n2.  This allows for **absolute path traversal**.\n3.  An attacker can access files and directories outside the intended web root folder.\n\nThe root cause is the unsafe use of the Flask send_file function leading to the **absolute path traversal**, and the impact is unauthorized file access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-36 (Absolute Path Traversal) as the most relevant CWE due to the vulnerability description explicitly mentioning **absolute path traversal**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section strongly supports this classification, repeatedly stating that the **root cause** is the \"The Flask send_file function is used unsafely,\" leading to \"**Absolute path traversal**.\"\n\nThe retriever results also support this, with CWE-36 having a good similarity score. The hierarchy of CWEs further solidifies this decision, as CWE-36 is a child of CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')), making it a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nThe final decision is based on the explicit mention of **absolute path traversal** in the vulnerability description and the supporting evidence from the CVE summaries. This makes CWE-36 the most appropriate and specific classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
