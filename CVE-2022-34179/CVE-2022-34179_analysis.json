This is a child of CWE-22 **Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**. CWE-73 **External Control of File Name or Path** can precede CWE-23, indicating a potential vulnerability chain where external control over the file path leads to path traversal.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe23[\"CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    \n    cwe23 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe23\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe23 primary\n    class cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with external control of a file name or path (CWE-73), which then leads to a relative path traversal (CWE-23), ultimately allowing unauthorized access to files on the Jenkins controller file system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-23 as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description and CVE details. The vulnerability description states the weakness is a **relative path traversal** vulnerability. The CVE summary indicates that the `style` query parameter is not validated, leading to a relative path traversal. This is strong evidence for CWE-23.\n\nThe relationship analysis confirms that CWE-23 is a specific type of path traversal, making it a suitable choice. CWE-73 is included as a secondary weakness because the vulnerability involves external control over the `style` parameter, which influences the file path.\n\nThe selection of CWE-23 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the **relative path traversal** vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Detailed Analysis of Selected CWEs:\n\n*   **CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal**\n    *   **Match:** The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **relative path traversal** vulnerability.
