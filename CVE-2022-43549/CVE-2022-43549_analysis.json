CWE-287 is a Class level CWE that is discouraged as a mapping because there are more specific CWEs available. CWE-1390 is a Class level CWE and a child of CWE-287, and is more specific than CWE-287, but less specific than CWE-306.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe1390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe287,cwe1390 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper authentication** (**ROOTCAUSE**), leading to the ability for attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms (**IMPACT**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The key phrase \"Improper authentication\" from the vulnerability description directly points to authentication-related CWEs. The CVE reference links content summary explicitly states that the root cause is related to a vulnerability that allows users to bypass authentication mechanisms.\n\nThe Retriever Results also suggest CWE-306, CWE-287 and CWE-1390 as potential candidates. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is the most specific and best fits the description because the vulnerability results in an authentication bypass.\n\nCWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is a more general class of weakness and is discouraged when more specific CWEs are available, but still a reasonable, secondary candidate. CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) is also considered as a secondary candidate, as it describes a situation where the authentication mechanism is not strong enough, but CWE-306 is a better fit.\n\nThe selection of CWE-306 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it accurately represents the **lack of authentication** for a critical function, leading to the authentication bypass.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n*This CWE is not relevant because the issue is about **improper authentication**, not insufficient privileges.*\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE is not relevant because the provided text does not indicate if an algorithm was implemented incorrectly.*\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
