The secondary CWE, CWE-379 **Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions**, is also a Base level CWE. CWE-367 is a child of CWE-362 **Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')**. CWE-379 is a child of CWE-377 **Insecure Temporary File**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe379[\"CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions\"]\n    cwe377[\"CWE-377: Insecure Temporary File\"]\n    \n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    cwe379 -->|CHILDOF| cwe377\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe367 primary\n    class cwe379 secondary\n    class cwe362,cwe377 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the use of `tempfile.mktemp`, leading to a **TOCTOU race condition** (CWE-367). In some cases, this also leads to the creation of temporary files in directories with insecure permissions (CWE-379), further exacerbating the security risk.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-367 as the primary weakness due to the **TOCTOU race condition** inherent in the use of `tempfile.mktemp`. The evidence clearly indicates that the vulnerability arises from the **time gap** between checking for the existence of a temporary file and its actual creation, allowing an attacker to potentially create a malicious file in its place. The retriever results also strongly support CWE-367 as the primary weakness.\n\nAdditionally, the vulnerability description mentions that in several instances, TensorFlow was supposed to create a temporary directory instead of a file. This logic bug, hidden by the `mktemp` function usage, suggests a potential secondary weakness related to the insecure creation of temporary files, specifically CWE-379 **Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions**. This is also supported by the retriever results which ranked CWE-379 as a highly relevant CWE.\n\nTherefore, the final assessment identifies CWE-367 as the primary weakness, with CWE-379 as a secondary contributing factor. These CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity (Base level) and accurately represent the root causes of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nOpening temporary files without appropriate measures or controls can leave the file, its contents and any function that it impacts vulnerable to attack.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a temporary file in a directory whose permissions allow unintended actors to determine the file's existence or otherwise access that file.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
