CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is a child of CWE-284 as well. CWE-266 being a base-level weakness is preferred over the class-level CWE-862. The hierarchical relationships help narrow down the selection to the most specific and relevant CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe266 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe266 primary\n    class cwe862,cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Incorrect Privilege Assignment** (CWE-266), which leads to **Privilege Escalation**. The **Privilege Escalation** allows the attacker to gain higher privileges than intended.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered CWE-862 and CWE-285 based on the description and retriever results. However, after a detailed analysis and considering the relationships, CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) was chosen as the primary CWE due to the **privilege escalation** impact. The vulnerability description mentions \"Unauth. Privilege Escalation vulnerability in ARMember premium plugin <= 5.5.1 on WordPress,\" which clearly points towards an issue related to how privileges are assigned and managed. The evidence supports this decision, although more specific technical details would increase confidence.\n\nThe choice of CWE-266 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the **incorrect privilege assignment** that leads to the **privilege escalation**, which is the core of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 5799.51\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 5773.09\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check",
