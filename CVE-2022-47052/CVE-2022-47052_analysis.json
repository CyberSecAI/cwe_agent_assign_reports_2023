CWE-113's description focuses on HTTP headers, aligning perfectly with the vulnerability. CWE-113 can **precede** **CWE-79** (Cross-Site Scripting), indicating a chain where the **CRLF Injection** enables the XSS. **CWE-79** is also present as the **CRLF Injection** is used to inject HTML and Javascript into the page.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe93\n    cwe113 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe113 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n    class cwe93 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers (CWE-113)**, leading to the injection of malicious code into the HTTP response. This then results in **Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79)** and HTML Injection when the browser renders the malicious code.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **CRLF Injection** as the primary **weakness**, which aligns with the description of **CWE-113**. The vulnerability description key phrases identified \"**weakness**: **CRLF Injection**\" and \"**impact**: Reflected XSS and HTML Injection\".\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary provides strong evidence: \"The core weakness is the injection of CRLF characters into the HTTP response headers by manipulating the requested URL.\"\nThe retriever results suggested CWE-113, CWE-79, and CWE-93. The analysis of the vulnerability description and the relationships between the CWEs supports mapping the vulnerability to both **CWE-113** and **CWE-79**.\n\nCWE-113 is at the **Variant** level, which is the preferred level. The description of CWE-113 specifically mentions HTTP headers, making it a precise match. CWE-79 is a base class which is also acceptable.\n\nOther CWEs Considered and Rejected:\n*   CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') - Rejected because the vulnerability does not involve OS commands.\n*   CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') - Rejected because the vulnerability doesn't involve a command language other than OS commands.\n*   CWE-20: Improper Input Validation - Rejected because it is too high-level and not specific enough. The specific issue is **CRLF Injection**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a query intended to access or manipulate data in a data store such as a database, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that can modify the intended logic of the query.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
