Also, CWE-187 (Partial String Comparison) is a peer of CWE-183 (Permissive List of Allowed Inputs) and CWE-184 (Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs), all of which deal with issues of inadequate input validation. The variant level of CWE-1385 provided a focused representation of the missing origin validation, while CWE-187 highlighted the flaw in the comparison logic.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1385[\"CWE-1385: Missing Origin Validation in WebSockets\"]\n    cwe346[\"CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\"]\n    cwe187[\"CWE-187: Partial String Comparison\"]\n    cwe1023[\"CWE-1023: Improper Restriction of String Length\"]\n\n    cwe1385 -->|CHILDOF| cwe346\n    cwe187 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1023\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1385 primary\n    class cwe346,cwe187 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **mishandling of check_origin wildcarding**, specifically the **incorrect implementation of wildcard subdomain matching**. This leads to a **bypass of origin checks**, which allows an attacker to establish unauthenticated channel connections.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **mishandling of check_origin wildcarding** detailed in the vulnerability description. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary provided strong evidence, explaining the flawed logic in `compare_host?` and how `String.ends_with?(request_host, allowed_host)` failed to properly validate wildcard subdomains, leading to bypass origin checks.\n\nThe Retriever Results pointed to several potential CWEs, including CWE-625 (Permissive Regular Expression), CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output), and CWE-1385 (Missing Origin Validation in WebSockets). However, CWE-1385 stood out due to its specific focus on origin validation in WebSockets, aligning perfectly with the vulnerability's context.\n\nCWE-1385 is \"The product uses a WebSocket, but it does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\" The vulnerability description states \"**mishandles check_origin wildcarding**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary says \"The core issue is the flawed logic in `compare_host?`, specifically, `String.ends_with?(request_host, allowed_host)` did not properly validate wildcard subdomains.\". This is an origin validation error.\n\nCWE-187 is \"Partial String Comparison\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary says \"The code used `String.ends_with?` to compare the request origin against allowed origins, but it failed to properly account for the subdomain dot prefix when a wildcard (`*.`) was used.\" This is a partial string comparison.\n\nThe final decision prioritized CWE-1385 as the primary CWE due to its specific relevance to WebSocket origin validation and CWE-187 for it's partial string comparison. This selection is at the optimal level of specificity, addressing the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies",
