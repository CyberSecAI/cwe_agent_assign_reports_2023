The analysis considered its children to find a more specific Base or Variant CWE, but none were a better fit. CWE-862's parent is CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), which is a higher-level Class. The analysis also considered CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource), but it was deemed less appropriate due to the **missing permission check** being the root cause, rather than an incorrect assignment.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe280[\"CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\"]\n    cwe274[\"CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe280 --o|PEEROF| cwe862\n    cwe274 --o|PEEROF| cwe862\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe732,cwe280,cwe274 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing permission check**, leading to the ability to write permission usage records of an app, and ultimately resulting in local escalation of privilege. The chain is: **Missing permission check** (CWE-862) -> Write permission usage records -> Local escalation of privilege.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The key phrase \"missing permission check\" strongly suggests CWE-862.\n\nThe evidence:\n\n*   Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:\n    *   **rootcause:** **missing permission check**\n    *   **impact:** write permission usage records of an app\n*   CVE Reference Links Content Summary:\n    *   \"Root cause: Missing permission check\"\n    *   \"Weaknesses: Improper access control\"\n    *   \"Impact: Local escalation of privilege by writing permission usage records of an app.\"\n\nThe retriever results also support CWE-862 as the top candidate. Although CWE-862 is a Class, it is the most specific CWE that accurately describes the **missing permission check** (**missing authorization**) in the vulnerability. The alternatives considered were less precise.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that generates incorrect or unintended results that are later used in security-critical decisions or resource management.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. In many cases, lower-level children or descendants are more appropriate. However, sometimes this weakness is forced to be used due to the lack of in-depth weakness research.
