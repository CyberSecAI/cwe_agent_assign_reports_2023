While the description clearly indicates the root cause is an inefficient regular expression, the impact is resource consumption, which makes CWE-400 also relevant, even though it's a more general category.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    cwe407 -->|PARENT| cwe1333\n    cwe400 -->|PARENT| cwe407\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n    class cwe407 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the use of an inefficient regular expression (**CWE-1333**), which leads to excessive CPU consumption, resulting in a denial-of-service (**CWE-400**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points to **CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity)** as the primary weakness. The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** section highlights \"Regular Expression Denial of Service\" as the **weakness**, and the **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** confirms that the root cause is a vulnerable regular expression leading to catastrophic backtracking. The retriever results also lists CWE-1333 as the top candidate.\n\nThe **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** states: \"The vulnerability is caused by a regular expression used to handle custom fragments within the html-minifier library... The unbounded quantifiers `*` and `+` in this regular expression, used with the alternation `(?:...|...)`, can lead to catastrophic backtracking when processing specially crafted input strings.\"\n\nThe **Complete CWE Specifications** for CWE-1333 further solidify this choice, as it explicitly mentions \"attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike.\"\n\nWhile **CWE-1333** is the root cause, the resulting impact is **CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption)**. This is because the inefficient regular expression leads to excessive CPU consumption, effectively causing a denial-of-service.\n\n**CWE-1333** is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the coding error (inefficient regular expression).\n**CWE-400** is included as a secondary weakness to represent the resulting impact of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because the issue is not related to validation of input equivalence.*\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because it is too high-level.*\n\n## CWE-392: Missing Report of Error Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product encounters an error but does not provide a status code or return value to indicate that an error has occurred.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because the primary issue is not related to error reporting.*\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This CWE was not selected because the primary issue is not related to the improper handling of exceptional conditions.*\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because it does not involve a reachable assertion.*\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because it does not involve the exposure of resources to the wrong sphere.*\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because it is not related to an incomplete list of disallowed inputs.*\n\n## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because it does not involve an unchecked return value.*\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This CWE was not selected because it does not involve improper resource shutdown or release.*\n\n## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant",
