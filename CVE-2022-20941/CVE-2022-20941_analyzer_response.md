# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2022-20941

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CWE-862** | **Missing Authorization** | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |
| CWE-807 | Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is the hierarchical structure. CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** is a child of the higher-level CWE-285 **Improper Authorization** and CWE-284 **Improper Access Control**. Since the vulnerability description clearly indicates the *absence* of authorization, CWE-862 provides the most specific and accurate classification. CWE-306 **Missing Authentication** was considered as a secondary CWE, since the advisory could have been interpreted as the sensitive information should have had Authentication, but based on the summary, it was clear that this involved a lack of authorization checks, not authentication. CWE-807 **Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision** was also considered as a secondary CWE.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** and **insufficient entropy in resource names**. This leads to the ability to enumerate resources and ultimately retrieve sensitive information.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on the **missing authorization** aspect of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description clearly states, "This vulnerability is due to **missing authorization** for certain resources in the web-based management interface together with insufficient entropy in these resource names." This directly supports the selection of CWE-862 **Missing Authorization**. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section reinforces this by stating, "The root cause is **missing authorization** and insufficient entropy in resource names which allows unauthenticated remote attackers to enumerate and retrieve sensitive information from the device via HTTPS requests."

The selection of CWE-862 is further justified by its description: "The product does not perform any authorization check before allowing an actor to access a resource or perform an action." This aligns perfectly with the vulnerability where the Cisco FMC software fails to check authorization before allowing access to certain resources.

CWE-284 **Improper Access Control** and CWE-285 **Improper Authorization** were considered but deemed too general. While technically applicable, they do not capture the specific root cause as accurately as CWE-862. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-284 explicitly discourages its use when more specific descendants are available.

CWE-306 **Missing Authentication for Critical Function** was considered as a possible alternative but ultimately rejected as authentication is not the primary issue. The problem is that authorization checks are **missing** *after* a user (or lack thereof) attempts to access the resource.

CWE-807 **Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision** was also considered, but the primary issue isn't that the system relies on untrusted inputs for a *decision*, but rather that there isn't a decision (authorization check) happening at all.

The final selection of CWE-862 is based on the clear evidence of **missing authorization** in the vulnerability description, the supporting information in the CVE Reference Links, and the MITRE mapping guidance that favors specific CWEs over general ones. This provides a high level of confidence in the accuracy of the classification.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is "asymmetric."

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.



## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges 
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**
