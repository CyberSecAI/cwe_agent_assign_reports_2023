CWE-131 is a root cause, while CWE-787 is the direct consequence. Both are base-level CWEs. CWE-131 can precede CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), and CWE-787 is a more specific type of CWE-119.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe131[\"CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe131 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe119 --> cwe787\n    cwe131 --> cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe131 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect calculation of buffer size** (CWE-131). This **root cause** leads directly to an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787), which is the **weakness** that can then be exploited to achieve local escalation of privilege.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the out-of-bounds write is a consequence of an incorrect calculation of the buffer size: \"In throttling, there is a possible **out of bounds write** due to an **incorrect calculation of buffer size**.\" The primary CWE is therefore CWE-131, representing the root cause. CWE-787 represents the resulting vulnerability.\n\nThe retriever results support this by listing CWE-131 as the top combined result. The \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section lists CWE-787 as the primary match, however, that is the resulting vulnerability and not the root cause.\n\nBoth CWE-131 and CWE-787 are at the base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n**Rationale**: While input is involved, it is not the core issue. The core issue is the incorrect calculation, not the validation of input equivalence.\n\n## CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives a complex input with multiple elements or fields that must be consistent with each other, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually consistent.\n**Rationale**: Similar to CWE-1289, input validation is not the primary issue.\n\n## CWE-606: Unchecked Input for Loop Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly check inputs that are used for loop conditions, potentially leading to a denial of service or other consequences because of excessive looping.\n**Rationale**: This CWE is about unchecked input for loop conditions, which is not the specific issue here.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n**Rationale**: This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is not about relying on untrusted inputs for security decisions.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n**Rationale**: This is the **root cause** of the vulnerability, as the incorrect calculation leads to an out-of-bounds write. This is selected as the primary CWE.\n\n## CWE-179: Incorrect Behavior Order: Early Validation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product validates input before applying protection mechanisms that modify the input, which could allow an attacker to bypass the validation via dangerous inputs that only arise after the modification.\n**Rationale**: This is not relevant, as the issue is not about the order of validation.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n**Rationale**: This CWE does not apply, as the issue is not related to a permissive list of allowed inputs.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n**Rationale**: While integer calculations are involved, the primary issue is not an underflow specifically.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n**Rationale**: This is not relevant, as the issue is not about resource shutdown or release.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n**Rationale**: The vulnerability is not due to an incomplete list of disallowed inputs.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 7525.25\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value.\n**Rationale**: While integer calculations are involved, the primary issue is not an overflow specifically.\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 7150.89\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.\n**Rationale**: The primary issue is the incorrect calculation, not the validation of the specified quantity.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6968.51\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n**Rationale**: While integer calculations are involved, the primary issue is not an underflow specifically.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6900.91\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n**Rationale**: The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds *write*, not a read.",
