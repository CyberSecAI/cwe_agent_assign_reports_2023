CWE-789 is more specific because it focuses on the size of the memory allocation, aligning with the vulnerability description mentioning \"very large image files.\"\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe789 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n    class cwe400 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the application allocating memory for proxied images and **improperly controlling the amount of memory allocated**. This lack of control, especially when handling very large image files, leads to excessive memory consumption and ultimately causes the server to crash.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Improper Memory Allocation**\n  - **Weakness:** Allows links to very large image files\n  - **Impact:** Crash the server\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the **improper memory allocation** for proxied images, specifically when handling very large image files, leads to excessive memory consumption and a server crash. This aligns well with CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value), which focuses on allocating memory based on an untrusted size value without ensuring it's within expected limits. The vulnerability description key phrases indicate that the **rootcause** is **improper memory allocation**, and the **impact** is to crash the server using links to very large images.\n\nThe choice of CWE-789 is based on the following:\n\n*   The description explicitly mentions memory allocation based on \"very large image files,\" indicating an excessive size value.\n*   CWE-789 is a Variant, providing a more specific classification than its parent, CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling).\n*   CWE-789's description directly aligns with the vulnerability's details: \"**The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.**\"\n\nCWE-770 is considered a secondary CWE because it describes the broader issue of allocating resources without limits, which is a contributing factor to the vulnerability but not as specific as the excessive size value aspect covered by CWE-789.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is that the image proxy component in Mattermost allocates memory for multiple copies of a proxied image, which allows an authenticated attacker to crash the server via links to very large image files.\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n## Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives a complex input with multiple elements or fields that must be consistent with each other, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually consistent.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive -
