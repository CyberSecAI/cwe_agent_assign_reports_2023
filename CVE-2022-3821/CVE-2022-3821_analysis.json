This leads to an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787) which is a base level CWE and child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).

An attacker could supply specific values for time and accuracy that leads to **buffer overrun** in format_timespan(), leading to a Denial of Service.\"\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary states:\n- \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** An off-by-one error exists in the `format_timespan()` function within the `time-util.c` file of the systemd project.\"\n- \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer Overflow: The `format_timespan()` function calculates the number of bytes it will write to a buffer incorrectly, which leads to writing beyond the bounds of the provided buffer, resulting in a buffer overflow. Specifically, the line `n = MIN((size_t) k, l);` where `n` becomes the size of buffer `l`, followed by `p += n;` will cause `p` to point one byte after the buffer `buf`, which then leads to an overwrite when null-terminating with `*p=0;`\"\n- \"**Off-by-one Error:** The core issue is that the code allows `p` to be incremented to point beyond the end of the buffer, and then attempts to write a null terminator at that out-of-bounds location.\"\n\nBased on the evidence, CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error) and CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) are the most appropriate CWEs.\n\nCWE-193 is selected as the primary CWE because the root cause of the vulnerability is the **off-by-one error** in the calculation of the buffer size. This error allows the code to write one byte beyond the intended boundary of the buffer.\n\nCWE-787 is selected as a secondary CWE because the **off-by-one error** directly leads to an out-of-bounds write, causing a buffer overflow.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause and resulting weakness of the vulnerability.",
