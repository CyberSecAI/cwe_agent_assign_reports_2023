CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is considered as a possible contributing factor, especially as it relates to allocating resources without proper limits. CWE-401 directly addresses the **buffer leak** issue, which is the root cause of the vulnerability. CWE-770 could be seen as a prerequisite to the **buffer leak**, as allocating without limits can exacerbate the impact of the leak.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\"]\n    \n    cwe401 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    cwe770 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe401\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe401 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n    class cwe404 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a WebSocket PONG message being received. The **buffer leak** occurs because the allocated memory for the PONG message is not released due to a missing handler. This leads to memory exhaustion and ultimately a denial of service. The chain can be summarized as:\n\n1.  Incoming WebSocket PONG message.\n2.  **Buffer Leak** (CWE-401) due to missing handler.\n3.  Memory exhaustion.\n4.  Denial of Service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment was based on the provided vulnerability description, focusing on the root cause (**buffer leak**) and the impact (memory exhaustion, denial of service). The retriever results and complete CWE specifications were then analyzed to identify the most appropriate CWE(s).\n\nThe selection of CWE-401 is primarily based on the following evidence:\n\n*   The vulnerability description mentions a **buffer leak** that leads to memory exhaustion.\n*   The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause is a failure to deallocate a buffer after receiving a WebSocket PONG frame.\n*   CWE-401 is defined as \"The product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.\"\n*   The work around is to add a message handler which handles the incoming PONG and prevents the leak by releasing the buffer.\n\nCWE-770 was considered because the description notes that the **buffer leak** leads to memory exhaustion which can be thought of as a form of resource exhaustion. The description of CWE-770 is \"The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.\". This could be a contributing factor, as a lack of limits on memory allocation might exacerbate the leak.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-401 is a Variant that directly addresses the **buffer leak** issue. While CWE-770 is a Base, it provides additional context by highlighting the potential for resource exhaustion due to unlimited allocation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25
