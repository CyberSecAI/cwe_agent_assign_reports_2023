Given that the specifics of static vs dynamic injection are not provided, CWE-94 [Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')] is the most appropriate **Base** CWE.\n\nCWE-94 [Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')] is selected because the vulnerability involves the **improper control of code generation**, which can lead to code injection and subsequent remote code execution.
