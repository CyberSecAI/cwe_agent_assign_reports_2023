It is related to CWE-327 **Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm** and CWE-311 **Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data** via peer and child relationships. While CWE-326 is the best fit, CWE-327 is a close peer and could also be considered. CWE-311 is a parent of CWE-312 **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information** and CWE-319 **Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information**. These relationships help to understand the context of the weakness and potential alternative classifications.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe326[\"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    \n    cwe326 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe327 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe327 --|PEEROF| cwe311\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe326 primary\n    class cwe327,cwe311 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause**, an **inadequate encryption strength** (DES cipher). This leads to the impact of sensitive information being easily decrypted.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the use of DES cipher with **inadequate encryption strength** as the root cause. The retriever results and complete CWE specifications were then examined to find the best fit. The primary CWE is CWE-326 **Inadequate Encryption Strength**, as the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the use of a cipher with inadequate strength. This CWE aligns with the description stating that sensitive information can be easily decrypted due to the weak encryption.\n\nCWE-327 **Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm** was also considered, as DES is considered a broken algorithm. However, the description focuses more on the **inadequate strength** aspect rather than the algorithm being inherently broken. Therefore, CWE-326 is a more accurate fit.\n\nCWE-311 **Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data** was considered because the **inadequate encryption** could be interpreted as effectively missing encryption. However, the vulnerability description states that encryption is used, but it is weak. Therefore, CWE-326 is a more accurate fit.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause and the specific weakness described in the vulnerability description. The assessment is primarily based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description, specifically the key phrase \"**inadequate encryption strength**.\"\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
