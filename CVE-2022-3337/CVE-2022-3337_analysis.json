Its children, such as CWE-639 [CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key], were considered but did not perfectly fit. CWE-472 [CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter] is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-642 and CWE-471, suggesting a potential reliance on client-side data.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe472[\"CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe642[\"CWE-642: External Control of Critical State Data\"]\n    cwe471[\"CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe472 -->|CHILDOF| cwe642\n    cwe472 -->|CHILDOF| cwe471\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe472 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284,cwe642,cwe471 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing authorization** check (CWE-862) on the WARP mobile client, leading to the ability to **delete a VPN profile**. This bypasses the intended restrictions enforced by the Zero Trust platform, ultimately leading to a loss of control and monitoring capabilities. The secondary weakness is the **external control of assumed-immutable web parameter** (CWE-472) where data passed from the client-side (e.g., a request to delete the profile) is not sufficiently validated, allowing the deletion to proceed despite the \"Lock WARP switch\" being enabled.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **missing authorization** (CWE-862) aspect, as highlighted by the vulnerability description stating that a user could **delete a VPN profile** despite the \"Lock WARP switch\" being enabled. This indicates that the application **fails to properly check if the user is authorized to perform the delete operation** under the given conditions.\n\nThe evidence supporting this includes:\n- Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: \"**weakness:** **delete a VPN profile from WARP mobile client**\"\n- CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"The vulnerability lies in the insufficient protection of the VPN profile from deletion, bypassing the intended restriction of the 'Lock WARP switch' feature.\"\n\nThe relationship analysis further reinforces this, as CWE-862 is a child of CWE-285 [CWE-285: Improper Authorization] and CWE-284 [CWE-284: Improper Access Control], indicating a broader issue of access control.\n\nCWE-472 [CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter] was selected as a secondary CWE because the client is able to send a request that is not validated.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n- CWE-863 [CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization]: While relevant, CWE-862 is more precise because the authorization check is missing entirely rather than incorrectly performed.\n- CWE-284 [CWE-284: Improper Access Control]: This is too high-level (Pillar) and doesn't provide sufficient specificity.\n- CWE-1390 [CWE-1390: Weak Authentication], CWE-288 [CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel], CWE-290 [CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing]: These relate to authentication bypass, which is not the primary issue here. The user is assumed to be authenticated but lacks proper authorization to delete the profile.\n- CWE-319 [CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information], CWE-201 [CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data]: These relate to sensitive information handling, which is not the primary concern in this vulnerability.\n- CWE-639 [CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key]: Not the primary issue, which is a missing authorization check in the first place, regardless of user-controlled keys.\n- CWE-425 [CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')]: This CWE is not applicable because the issue isn't about directly requesting resources without authorization, but rather the **missing authorization** check on a specific action (deleting the profile).\n- CWE-471 [CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)]: This CWE is less relevant because the core issue is not about modifying data that is assumed to be immutable, but rather the ability to delete a VPN profile due to **missing authorization**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause (**missing authorization** check) and a contributing factor (**external control of assumed-immutable web parameter**) leading to the vulnerability. CWE-862 is a Class that can be more specific, but there isn't sufficient evidence.",
