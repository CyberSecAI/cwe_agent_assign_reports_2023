## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis

The primary CWE selected is CWE-287, Improper Authentication, which is a Class-level CWE. CWE-1390, Weak Authentication, is a child of CWE-287 and was considered as a more specific option, but the evidence suggests that the authentication mechanism was fundamentally flawed due to the **incorrect asynchronous handling**, which justifies the broader classification of Improper Authentication.

```

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain begins with the **incorrect use of asynchronous functions** (specifically, the lack of `await`), leading to the authentication bypass.

*   **Root Cause:** Incorrect asynchronous handling (**not using await to wait for the verification result**)
*   **Weakness:** Improper Authentication (CWE-287) or Weak Authentication (CWE-1390)
*   **Impact:** Authentication Bypass

## Summary of Analysis

The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the supporting CVE reference. The key piece of evidence is the statement that the `verifyAccessKey` function, an async function, was **not using await to wait for the verification result**, leading to authentication bypass.

The selection of CWE-287 is primarily driven by the root cause described, which clearly indicates a failure in the authentication process. While CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) is a more specific child of CWE-287, the lack of proper handling of the asynchronous function suggests a more fundamental flaw in the authentication process itself. Therefore, CWE-287 is deemed more appropriate.

The retriever results also support the selection of CWE-287 and CWE-1390. The "Mapping Guidance" for CWE-287 suggests considering children like CWE-1390, which was considered. However, the core issue isn't just a weak mechanism, but a broken one due to the asynchronous handling.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-31013

## Vulnerability Description
Chat Server is the chat server for Vartalap, an open-source messaging application. Versions 2.3.2 until 2.6.0 suffer from a bug in validating the access token, resulting in authentication bypass. The function `this.authProvider.verifyAccessKey` is an async function, as the code is not using `await` to wait for the verification result. Every time the function responds back with success, along with an unhandled exception if the token is invalid. A patch is available in version 2.6.0.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **not using await to wait for the verification result**
- **impact:** authentication bypass
- **product:** Vartalap
- **version:** 2.3.2 until 2.6.0
- **component:** Chat Server

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2022-31013:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the access token validation process within the chat-server application. Specifically, the `verifyAccessKey` function, which is asynchronous, was not being properly awaited before the code proceeded. This caused the authentication to be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Asynchronous Handling:** The code failed to use `await` when calling the async `this.authProvider.verifyAccessKey` function. This caused the function to return immediately without waiting for the verification to complete.
- **Authentication Bypass:** Due to the lack of proper await, the application always returned a successful (200) response, even when the access token was invalid. Any invalid access token would bypass the check and allow unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could bypass authentication, gaining unauthorized access to the chat server and potentially its functionalities and data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Invalid Access Token:** An attacker could use an invalid or malformed access token.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the chat server to send the malicious request with the invalid access token.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the chat server.
- No prior knowledge of valid tokens is required, as any token is sufficient to bypass authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code was present in chat-server versions >2.3.2.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 2.6.0 by adding the await keyword before calling `this.authProvider.verifyAccessKey`, ensuring that the function returns before proceeding to the next step, returning correct authorization status.
- The vulnerability is tracked under GHSA-xx4j-qqpp-v277.
- The related CWE is CWE-285 (Improper Authorization).

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).




## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.

### Extended Description
Some regular expression engines have a feature called "backtracking". If the token cannot match, the engine "backtracks" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.
 Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:


  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.

  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.

  - The input can be long enough.

 Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. 

### Alternative Terms
ReDoS: ReDoS is an abbreviation of "Regular expression Denial of Service".
Regular Expression Denial of Service: While this term is attack-focused, this is commonly used to describe the weakness.
Catastrophic backtracking: This term is used to describe the behavior of the regular expression as a negative technical impact.

### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-603: Use of Client-Side Authentication
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A client/server product performs authentication within client code but not in server code, allowing server-side authentication to be bypassed via a modified client that omits the authentication check.

### Extended Description
Client-side authentication is extremely weak and may be breached easily. Any attacker may read the source code and reverse-engineer the authentication mechanism to access parts of the application which would otherwise be protected.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.






## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.

### Extended Description
When a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by interfering in the communication path between the host and client. The product might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the product might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host.
