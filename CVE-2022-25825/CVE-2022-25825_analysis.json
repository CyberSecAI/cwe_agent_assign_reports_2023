This vulnerability could potentially be mapped to a more specific Base or Variant level CWE if more information was available.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control**, leading to the ability for attackers to access the authcode for sign-in. This is a direct cause-and-effect relationship.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **improper access control** as the root cause, which aligns with `CWE-284` (Improper Access Control). The provided evidence explicitly states \"**Improper access control** vulnerability in Samsung Account prior to version 13.1.0.1 allows attackers to access to the authcode for sign-in.\"\n\nThe retriever results suggest `CWE-287` (Improper Authentication), `CWE-285` (Improper Authorization), `CWE-863` (Incorrect Authorization), and other related CWEs. Given that the vulnerability description specifically mentions **improper access control**, which is closely related to authorization, focusing on authorization-related CWEs is appropriate.\n\n`CWE-863` (Incorrect Authorization) is considered as a secondary candidate because the authorization check is performed, but it's done incorrectly. `CWE-285` (Improper Authorization) is also considered because access control mechanisms might be missing or not performed correctly. However, the description leans more towards an existing mechanism being flawed rather than completely absent, which is why `CWE-863` is slightly favored over `CWE-285`.\n\n`CWE-284` is kept as the primary CWE despite the discouragement because the description uses the high level phrase **improper access control**. It should be considered for refactoring with a more precise child of `CWE-284` if more information is available.\n\n`CWE-284` is at the optimal level of specificity given the limited information. While more specific CWEs could be considered, the current evidence does not strongly support a lower-level mapping.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
