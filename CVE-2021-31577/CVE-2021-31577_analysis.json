The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a \"**missing permission check**,\" which directly corresponds to the definition of CWE-862: \"The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\"\n\nThe evidence for this mapping is substantial. The \"**missing permission check**\" in the Vulnerability Description Key Phrases is direct evidence supporting the selection of CWE-862.\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-862 is a child of CWE-285 **Improper Authorization** and CWE-284 **Improper Access Control**, but those parent CWEs are too high-level.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the lack of an authorization check.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
