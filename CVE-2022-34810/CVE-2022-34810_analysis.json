The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly states the **root cause** as the \"RQM Plugin does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint\" and identifies the weakness as \"**Missing authorization**.\" This evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-862 **CWE-862: Missing Authorization** as the primary CWE. The relationship graph reinforced the decision to choose the most specific applicable CWE, which in this case is CWE-862, over its more general parents. The selection of CWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity because the vulnerability is directly caused by the absence of an authorization check.\n\nCWE-538 **CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory** was also considered, as the enumeration of credential IDs does result in sensitive information being exposed. The vulnerability description supports this since the \"impact\" is that attackers can \"enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.\" This is sensitive information being exposed.\n\nThe retriever results suggested other CWEs such as CWE-256 **CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password**, CWE-522 **CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials**, and CWE-863 **CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization**. However, these were deemed less relevant. CWE-256 and CWE-522 were not selected because the vulnerability doesn't involve storing passwords in plaintext or using insufficiently protected credentials directly. CWE-863 was not selected because the core issue is not an incorrect authorization check but the complete absence of one.\n\nThe selection is primarily based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, both of which highlight the **missing authorization check**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community.
