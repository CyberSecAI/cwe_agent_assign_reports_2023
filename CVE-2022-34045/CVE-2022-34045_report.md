## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-321 | Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-798 | Use of Hard-coded Credentials | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the ChildOf relationship between CWE-321 and CWE-798. CWE-321 is a more specific variant of CWE-798, dealing specifically with cryptographic keys. Given the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **hardcoded encryption/decryption key**, CWE-321 was selected as the primary CWE due to its higher level of specificity.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events is straightforward: the root cause is the **hardcoded encryption/decryption key** (CWE-321) which directly leads to a potential compromise of the configuration files. There is no explicit mention of the impact or further weaknesses exploited, so the chain stops at the root cause.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis strongly suggested CWE-321 as the primary mapping due to the presence of a **hardcoded encryption/decryption key**.

The vulnerability description states: "Wavlink WN530HG4 M30HG4.V5030.191116 was discovered to contain a **hardcoded encryption/decryption key** for its configuration files at /etc_ro/lighttpd/www/cgi-bin/ExportAllSettings.sh."

This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-321: "The use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered."

The retriever results also support this selection, with CWE-321 being the top-ranked CWE. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-321 states that it is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level. Furthermore, the usage is ALLOWED and the rationale confirms its suitability.

CWE-798 "Use of Hard-coded Credentials" was considered as a secondary CWE because CWE-321 is a child of CWE-798. The hardcoded key falls under the broader category of hardcoded credentials. However, since the vulnerability explicitly involves a *cryptographic key*, CWE-321 is more specific and therefore the primary choice.

CWE-425 "Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')" was considered but not selected. While the configuration file might be accessed via a direct request, the root cause is the hardcoded key, not the lack of authorization on the file itself.

CWE-259 "Use of Hard-coded Password" was not selected because the vulnerability description refers to a key, not a password.

CWE-326 "Inadequate Encryption Strength" was considered but not selected because the problem isn't the strength of the encryption, but the fact that the key is hardcoded.

CWE-1240 "Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation" was considered, but the issue is not with the implementation of the algorithm but the use of a hardcoded key.

Based on the evidence and relationship analysis, CWE-321 is the most appropriate and specific CWE for this vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.84
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
To fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores or transmits sensitive data using an encryption scheme that is theoretically sound, but is not strong enough for the level of protection required.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
