While CWE-732 is a broader class, CWE-276 specifically addresses the **incorrect default permissions** set during installation, aligning directly with the udev rule configuration that made device nodes world-readable and writable.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe276[\"CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe276 -->|CHILDOF| cwe732\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe276 primary\n    class cwe732 secondary\n    class cwe319 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect udev rule** configuration (**incorrect default permissions**). This leads to the device nodes becoming world-readable and writable. Consequently, any process on the system could read traffic from keyboards, resulting in potential **information disclosure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-276 as the primary weakness due to the evidence highlighting the **incorrect default permissions** in the udev rule. The retriever results and the vulnerability description both support this assessment. The vulnerability description states that \"g810-led 0.4.2, a LED configuration tool for Logitech Gx10 keyboards, contained a **udev rule to make supported device nodes world-readable and writable**\". This directly indicates an **incorrect default permission**.\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this, stating: \"The `g810-led` package included udev rules that set the permissions of device nodes (specifically `/dev/input/event*`) to world-readable and writable (`MODE=\"666\"`). This allowed any user on the system to read input from these devices.\"\n\nCWE-276 is at the optimal level of specificity because it precisely describes the root cause: the misconfiguration of file permissions during installation. While CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) is a parent, CWE-276 is more specific and better captures the essence of the **incorrect default permissions** weakness. The evidence supports the selection of CWE-276 as the primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
