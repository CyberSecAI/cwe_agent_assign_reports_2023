The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**password hash with insufficient computational effort**\" aligning directly with the definition of CWE-916. Other CWEs considered, such as CWE-759 and CWE-760, are children of CWE-916, providing more specific scenarios, but the description lacks details to support those more specific cases.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of Insufficiently Protected Hash\"]\n    cwe759[\"CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt\"]\n    cwe760[\"CWE-760: Use of a One-Way Hash with a Predictable Salt\"]\n    \n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe328\n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    cwe759 -->|CHILDOF| cwe916\n    cwe760 -->|CHILDOF| cwe916\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe916 primary\n    class cwe328,cwe327,cwe759,cwe760 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a password hash with insufficient computational effort** [CWE-916], leading to a compromised password database and the attacker's ability to recover passwords, ultimately resulting in unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly suggests CWE-916 as the primary weakness, given the explicit mention of \"**password hash with insufficient computational effort**\" in both the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The retriever results also list CWE-916 as the top candidate.\n\nThe analysis is based heavily on the provided evidence, specifically:\n\n*   Vulnerability Description: \"A use of **password hash with insufficient computational effort** vulnerability [**CWE-916**] in FortiSandbox before 4.2.0 may allow an attacker with access to the password database to efficiently mount bulk guessing attacks to recover the passwords.\"\n*   CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"The vulnerability stems from the use of a password hash with insufficient computational effort in FortiSandbox. This makes it easier to crack passwords if the password database is compromised.\"\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-916 is a base-level weakness, and the description aligns perfectly with its definition. Therefore, selecting CWE-916 is at the optimal level of specificity.\n\n**CWEs Considered But Not Used:**\n\n*   **CWE-759 and CWE-760:** These are variants of CWE-916 related to the use of one-way hashes without a salt or with a predictable salt, respectively. While possible, the provided information does not specify whether a salt was used or not, making CWE-916 a more appropriate and general classification.\n*   **CWE-328:** This CWE relates to the use of a weak hash algorithm. Although related, the description focuses more on the computational effort rather than the specific hash algorithm being weak.\n*   **CWE-311:** Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data was considered, but the description explicitly mentions hashing, not a lack of encryption.\n*   **CWE-836:** Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication was considered but is not applicable because the issue is not about using a hash *instead* of a password, but rather the hash itself being weak.",
