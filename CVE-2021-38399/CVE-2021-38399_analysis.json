CWE-23, **Relative Path Traversal**, is a child of CWE-22 and represents a specific type of path traversal. CWE-73, **External Control of File Name or Path**, can precede CWE-22, indicating that external control of a file name or path can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe23[\"CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    \n    cwe23 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe22\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe23,cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events for this vulnerability starts with the external input used to construct a pathname. The software then fails to properly neutralize special elements in the pathname, leading to path traversal. This allows an attacker to access unauthorized files and directories.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **relative path traversal** as the key weakness, supported by the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary. The Retriever Results and Complete CWE Specifications were used to refine the classification.\n\nThe selection of CWE-22 is based on its broad applicability to path traversal issues where external input is used to construct a pathname without proper sanitization, which directly aligns with the vulnerability description. CWE-23 is a more specific child of CWE-22 that deals with **relative path traversal**, which is mentioned in the description, but CWE-22 is a better fit. CWE-73 was considered because external control of the file name or path is often a prerequisite for path traversal, but the core issue is the **improper limitation of the pathname**, making CWE-22 a more direct and accurate classification.\n\nThe evidence for CWE-22 is found in the vulnerability description: \"Honeywell Experion PKS C200, C200E, C300, and ACE controllers are vulnerable to **relative path traversal**, which may allow an attacker access to unauthorized files and directories.\" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"* The root cause is a **Relative Path Traversal vulnerability** present in the affected Honeywell Experion PKS controllers.\"\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.83\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
