Although CWE-285 is broader, CWE-862 directly addresses the specific **missing authorization** issue described in the vulnerability. The absence of a permission check is the core of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing authorization** check in the form validation method.\n2.  **Weakness:** Attackers with Overall/Read permission can exploit this **missing permission check**.\n3.  **Impact:** Attackers can check for the existence of attacker-specified file paths on the Jenkins controller file system, leading to potential information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the Jenkins Buckminster Plugin 1.1.1 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation. The key phrase \" **missing permission check** \" directly points to an authorization issue.\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating: \" **Root Cause:** The plugin does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation\" and \" **Vulnerability:** Missing permission check.\"\n\nThe primary CWE match suggested is CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), which aligns perfectly with the vulnerability's root cause. The retriever results also list CWE-862 as the top combined result.\n\nCWE-862 is a Class-level CWE. While it might have Base-level children, none of them are more appropriate for this specific scenario. The description of CWE-862 directly matches the vulnerability: \"The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\"\n\nOther CWEs were considered but deemed less appropriate:\n\n*   CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization): This CWE implies that an authorization check is present but implemented incorrectly. In this case, there is no authorization check at all, making CWE-862 a more accurate fit.\n*   CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')): While the impact of the vulnerability involves checking for the existence of files, the root cause is not related to path traversal.\n*   CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource): This CWE is relevant when a resource is given the wrong permissions. However, the problem here is not incorrect permission assignment, but rather the **lack of any permission check** during form validation.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence and the MITRE mapping guidance, CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe

directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not

level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction

validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 4835.15\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-",
