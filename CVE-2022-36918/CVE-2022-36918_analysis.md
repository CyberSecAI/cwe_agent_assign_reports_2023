# Analysis for CVE-2022-36918

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 1.0 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the ChildOf relationship between CWE-862 and its parent CWE-285 (Improper Authorization). Although CWE-285 is broader, CWE-862 directly addresses the specific **missing authorization** issue described in the vulnerability. The absence of a permission check is the core of the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events is as follows:
1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing authorization** check in the form validation method.
2.  **Weakness:** Attackers with Overall/Read permission can exploit this **missing permission check**.
3.  **Impact:** Attackers can check for the existence of attacker-specified file paths on the Jenkins controller file system, leading to potential information disclosure.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly states that the Jenkins Buckminster Plugin 1.1.1 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation. The key phrase " **missing permission check** " directly points to an authorization issue.

The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating: " **Root Cause:** The plugin does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation" and " **Vulnerability:** Missing permission check."

The primary CWE match suggested is CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), which aligns perfectly with the vulnerability's root cause. The retriever results also list CWE-862 as the top combined result.

CWE-862 is a Class-level CWE. While it might have Base-level children, none of them are more appropriate for this specific scenario. The description of CWE-862 directly matches the vulnerability: "The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action."

Other CWEs were considered but deemed less appropriate:

*   CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization): This CWE implies that an authorization check is present but implemented incorrectly. In this case, there is no authorization check at all, making CWE-862 a more accurate fit.
*   CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')): While the impact of the vulnerability involves checking for the existence of files, the root cause is not related to path traversal.
*   CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource): This CWE is relevant when a resource is given the wrong permissions. However, the problem here is not incorrect permission assignment, but rather the **lack of any permission check** during form validation.

Therefore, based on the evidence and the MITRE mapping guidance, CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
