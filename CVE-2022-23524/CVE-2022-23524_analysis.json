The vulnerability description mentions \"**stack overflow**\" directly, which is an alternative term for stack-based buffer overflow. CWE-789, Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value, is also considered because excessive memory allocation on the stack can lead to a stack overflow. CWE-674 Uncontrolled Recursion is related to stack exhaustion, where the amount of recursion is not properly controlled.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe788[\"CWE-788: Allocation of Memory Without Limits\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe674[\"CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\"]\n    cwe834[\"CWE-834: Excessive Iteration\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe788\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe789 -->|PEEROF| cwe1325\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    cwe674 -->|CHILDOF| cwe834\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe789,cwe674 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **input to functions** in the `strvals` package causing a **stack overflow**. This leads to uncontrolled resource consumption and ultimately results in a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary selection is CWE-121, Stack-based Buffer Overflow, which directly aligns with the vulnerability description's mention of \"**stack overflow**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also indicates that the root cause is due to parsing of string inputs causing a stack overflow.\n\nThe evidence provided states: \"**Input to functions in the _strvals_ package can cause a stack overflow**\". The Retriever Results also list CWE-121 as the top combined result with a score of 0.800. This evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-121 as the primary CWE.\n\nCWE-789 and CWE-674 are considered as secondary CWEs. Although the vulnerability is directly described as a stack overflow, the root cause involves excessive memory allocation and potentially uncontrolled recursion. These factors contribute to the stack overflow condition.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-121 is a variant that directly addresses the stack-based buffer overflow, while CWE-789 and CWE-674 represent contributing factors at the base and class levels, respectively.\n\nRelevant CWE

Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads from a

conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may\n         become a very small or negative number.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is",
