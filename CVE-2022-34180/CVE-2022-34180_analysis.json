It's a child of CWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**). CWE-862 (**Missing Authorization**) is also a child of CWE-285. The vulnerability description states that the plugin \"**does not correctly perform the ViewStatus permission check**\", which aligns directly with the definition of CWE-863. While CWE-862 could also be considered, the explicit mention of performing the check, albeit incorrectly, makes CWE-863 a more precise fit. CWE-285 is a high-level class and discouraged.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe862,cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect performance of the ViewStatus permission check**, leading to the impact of unauthorized attackers being able to **obtain the build status badge icon**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The description clearly states the plugin \"**does not correctly perform the ViewStatus permission check**\". This statement directly supports the selection of CWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also states the root cause is \"**does not correctly perform the ViewStatus permission check**\" and lists \"**Improper authorization**\" as a weakness. This further reinforces the selection of CWE-863. While CWE-862 (**Missing Authorization**) was considered, the explicit mention of performing a check (albeit incorrectly) makes CWE-863 a more accurate and specific classification. The selection of CWE-863 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it is a Class-level CWE and accurately represents the **incorrect authorization** mechanism.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n#

Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly

abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an

of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**:

This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 5195.89\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
