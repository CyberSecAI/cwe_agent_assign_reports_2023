CWE-862 is a class-level CWE, and the description fits well since the product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. CWE-425, **Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')**, is a related weakness because the **lack of authorization** allows direct access to the AJAX action. CWE-425 is a child of CWE-862, indicating a more specific scenario where authorization is missing, allowing direct access to resources.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe425 secondary\n    class cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper authorization check** (CWE-862). This allows unauthenticated or improperly authenticated users to directly request sensitive information via an AJAX action (CWE-425). The final impact is the disclosure of sensitive information, such as the list of active plugins, PHP version, cURL version, and WordPress version.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **lack of proper authorization check** as the root cause of the vulnerability. The retriever results and the vulnerability description key phrases both support this assessment. The primary CWE is CWE-862, **Missing Authorization**, as the plugin **lacks an authorization check** for the AJAX action. This allows direct access to sensitive information. The evidence from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section states \"**rootcause: lack of proper authorization check**\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also indicates that \"The Shareaholic plugin had an AJAX action (`shareaholic_debug_info`) that **lacked proper authorization checks**.\"\n\nCWE-425, **Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')**, is considered as a secondary CWE because the **lack of authorization** allows attackers to directly request the sensitive information. This CWE is a child of CWE-862, representing a specific scenario where authorization is missing, thus enabling direct access.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-862 accurately captures the root cause, and CWE-425 further specifies how the missing authorization leads to direct access.\n\nCWE-284, **Improper Access Control**, was considered but not used as it is a high-level Pillar, and CWE-862 and CWE-425 are more specific and relevant.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n- CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')",
