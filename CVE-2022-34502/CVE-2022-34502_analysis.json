CWE-122, Heap-based Buffer Overflow, is a variant of CWE-787. CWE-119, Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, is a class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-787. The relationships show a clear path from the generic buffer handling issue (CWE-119) to the specific out-of-bounds write (CWE-787), which occurs on the heap (CWE-122). Choosing CWE-787 provides a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability than its parent, CWE-119.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe122,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the radare2 application **improperly handling** a crafted WASM binary file, leading to a **heap buffer overflow** when the `consume_encoded_name_new` function writes past the allocated buffer. This out-of-bounds write then results in a denial of service (DoS).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified a **heap buffer overflow**, which points towards CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow). The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary strongly supports this. The content summary states: \"**Heap Buffer Overflow:** The core weakness is a heap buffer overflow. This occurs when the program writes data beyond the allocated boundary of a heap buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory regions.\"\n\nCWE-787 is the most accurate base-level representation of the vulnerability: \"The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\" This aligns precisely with the heap buffer overflow described. CWE-122, Heap-based Buffer Overflow, is a variant that specifies the location of the buffer as the heap, which is also accurate and relevant.\n\nCWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) was considered but is a more general, class-level CWE. While technically applicable, it does not provide the specificity of CWE-787 or CWE-122. The MITRE mapping guidance discourages using CWE-119 when more specific CWEs are available.\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 and CWE-122 is based on direct evidence from the provided vulnerability description and is supported by the retriever results. These CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, accurately representing the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs
