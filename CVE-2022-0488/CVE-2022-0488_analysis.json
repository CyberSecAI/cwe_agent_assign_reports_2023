While CWE-400 is a broader class, CWE-1333 more precisely describes the **root cause** of the resource consumption. There's also a peer relationship between CWE-400 and other resource management issues like CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling), but the regex inefficiency is the more direct cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Insufficiently Protected Resource\"]\n\n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    cwe1333 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe400\n    cwe400 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n    class cwe407,cwe664 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the introduction of an inefficient regular expression (CWE-1333) in the markdown processing logic. This **inefficient regex** allows an attacker to craft input (a specific amount of blockquotes) that triggers excessive backtracking, leading to high CPU consumption and ultimately causing a timeout (resource exhaustion/denial of service).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the **root cause** of the timeout. The description clearly states that a \"specific amount of block-quotes\" can \"trigger a timeout on a page with markdown.\" While the result is a timeout (which could be related to resource exhaustion), the underlying issue is the **inefficient regular expression**.\n\nThe Retriever Results identified CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity) as the top candidate, which aligns directly with the vulnerability description. CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) was also considered, but it is a more general class and less specific to the **root cause**.\n\nThe decision to prioritize CWE-1333 is based on the following evidence:\n\n*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** The phrase \"trigger timeout on page with markdown by using a specific amount of block-quotes\" suggests a parsing or processing inefficiency related to markdown syntax.\n*   **Retriever Results:** CWE-1333 has the highest similarity score and directly addresses the complexity of regular expressions.\n*   **CWE Description:** The description of CWE-1333 mentions \"crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike,\" which aligns perfectly with the vulnerability.\n\nWhile CWE-400 could be considered a secondary effect, mapping it as the primary CWE would obscure the underlying weakness related to the regular expression's complexity. Therefore, CWE-1333 is chosen as the primary CWE due to its specificity and direct relevance to the **root cause**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
