The relationship shows how a specific use of the GET method results in the insertion of sensitive information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe598[\"CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    \n    cwe598 -->|CHILDOF| cwe201\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe598 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **CSRF token visible in the URL** which leads to **Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data** which results in information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis concludes that the primary weakness is CWE-598, with CWE-201 as a related weakness. This is based on the vulnerability description of a **CSRF token visible in the URL**, which may lead to information disclosure. The retriever results also support this classification.\n\nThe **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** section states that the **rootcause** is \"**CSRF token visible in URL**\" and the **impact** is \"information disclosure\". This aligns with CWE-598's description: \"The web application uses the HTTP GET method to process a request and includes sensitive information in the query string of that request.\"\n\nCWE-201 is a valid secondary CWE since it describes the insertion of sensitive information into sent data.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6017.09\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.129\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application uses the HTTP GET method to process a request and includes sensitive information in the query string of that request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n### CWE Selection and Justification\n\n1.  **CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings**\n    *   **Match:** The vulnerability description states that the **CSRF token is visible in the URL**. Using the GET method includes the token in the URL, which matches CWE-598's description.\n    *   **Abstraction:** Variant. This is the most specific CWE that matches the **rootcause**.\n    *   **Usage:** Allowed.\n    *   **Rationale:** The vulnerability description clearly indicates the use of the GET method with sensitive information (CSRF token) in the query string.\n    *   **Confidence:** 0.8\n\n2.  **CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data**\n    *   **Match:** The **CSRF token visible in the URL** being sent is sensitive information, which is what CWE-201 describes.\n    *   **Abstraction:** Base.\n    *   **Usage:** Allowed.\n    *   **Rationale:** The **CSRF token visible in the URL** qualifies as sensitive information being inserted into sent data.\n    *   **Confidence:** 0.7\n\n### CWEs Considered but Not Used\n\n*   **CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** - While the vulnerability involves a CSRF token, the core issue is the exposure of the token itself, not the CSRF vulnerability directly. Therefore, CWE-352 is not the primary weakness.\n*   **CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')** - This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability description does not mention redirection to an untrusted site.\n*   **CWE-214: Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information** - This CWE is not relevant because it relates to process invocation with sensitive command-line arguments, which is not the case in this vulnerability.\n*   **CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag** - This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability description does not mention cookies.\n*   **CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')** - This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability description does not mention XSS.\n*   **CWE-862: Missing Authorization** - This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability description does not mention authorization issues.\n*   **CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy** - This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability description does not mention any timing discrepancies.\n*   **CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse** - This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability description does not involve resource reuse.",
