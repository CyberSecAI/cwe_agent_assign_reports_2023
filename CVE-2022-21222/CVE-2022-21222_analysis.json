CWE-625 (Permissive Regular Expression) and CWE-777 (Regular Expression without Anchors) are related to regular expression issues. CWE-625 is a base-level CWE and describes that the product uses a regular expression that does not sufficiently restrict the set of allowed values and is a peer of CWE-184 and CWE-183. CWE-777 is a variant of CWE-625, specifying that the regular expression lacks anchors, potentially allowing malicious data to slip through. CWE-1333 is a child of CWE-407.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe625[\"CWE-625: Permissive Regular Expression\"]\n    cwe777[\"CWE-777: Regular Expression without Anchors\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    cwe777 -->|CHILDOF| cwe625\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe625,cwe777 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the use of an **inefficient regular expression (CWE-1333)**. This leads to excessive CPU consumption, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the inefficient regular expression, as stated in the vulnerability description: \"Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to the usage of insecure regular expression\". This directly corresponds to **CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity)**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating the \"vulnerability is due to the usage of an insecure regular expression\".\n\nCWE-625 and CWE-777 were considered as secondary candidates due to the involvement of regular expressions, but CWE-1333 is more specific to the ReDoS aspect of the vulnerability. The description of **CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity)** mentions that the product \"uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.\" This aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description's mention of \"Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)\". Therefore, CWE-1333 is the most appropriate choice. CWE-625 and CWE-777 might be contributing factors but are not the primary cause of the ReDoS.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-1333 is a base-level CWE, which is preferred for root cause analysis. While CWE-777 is a variant, it only describes a specific type of regular expression issue (lack of anchors), which isn't the core problem here. The core problem is the inefficient complexity of the regular expression itself, as stated in **CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity)**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-625: Permissive Regular Expression\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a regular expression that does not sufficiently restrict the set of allowed values.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-777: Regular Expression without Anchors\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a regular expression to perform neutralization, but the regular expression is not anchored and may allow malicious or malformed data to slip through.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-185: Incorrect Regular Expression\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product specifies a regular expression in a way that causes data to be improperly matched or compared.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-186: Overly Restrictive Regular Expression\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA regular expression is overly restrictive, which prevents dangerous values from being detected.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
