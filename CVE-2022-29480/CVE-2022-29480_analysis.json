While broad, it aligns with the reported impact of increased CPU utilization. CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE, and the mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific options exist. Given the available information, two potential child CWEs are relevant: CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) and CWE-410 (Insufficient Resource Pool). CWE-770 suggests a weakness in limiting resource allocation, while CWE-410 indicates that the resource pool is not large enough to handle peak demand. These two CWEs explain the general CWE-400. Also, CWE-1176 is a child of CWE-405 (Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)). \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe410[\"CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool\"]\n    cwe1176[\"CWE-1176: Inefficient CPU Computation\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe410 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe1176 -->|PEEROF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe410,cwe1176 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves undisclosed requests to big3d, leading to increased CPU resource utilization due to a lack of proper resource management or inefficient CPU computation. This results in uncontrolled resource consumption.\n  - **Root Cause**: Undisclosed requests\n  - **Weakness**: **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)** due to **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (CWE-770)** or **Insufficient Resource Pool (CWE-410)** which causes **Inefficient CPU Computation (CWE-1176)**\n  - **Impact**: increase in CPU resource utilization\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed towards CWE-400 as the primary weakness, supported by the description's emphasis on increased CPU resource utilization. However, the mapping guidance for CWE-400 discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available. Given the limited information, CWE-770 and CWE-410 are potential contributing factors, as they represent specific resource management issues. In addition, CWE-1176 represents the inefficient CPU computation that can lead to uncontrolled resource consumption. The final decision involves selecting CWE-400 as the primary weakness, acknowledging its limitations as a Class-level CWE, and including CWE-770, CWE-410, and CWE-1176 as secondary CWEs to provide a more detailed explanation of the vulnerability.\n\nThe assessment is primarily based on the vulnerability description, which states that undisclosed requests to big3d can cause an increase in CPU resource utilization. The evidence is limited due to the lack of specific details about the underlying cause of the resource consumption. The graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting potential child CWEs of CWE-400 that could provide a more precise classification. The selected CWEs represent the optimal level of specificity given the available evidence, balancing the need for accuracy with the limitations of the provided information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\nCWE-1289 was not selected because the vulnerability description doesn't suggest any issues with validating equivalence of inputs.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\nCWE-807 was not selected because the description does not emphasize the reliance on inputs in a security decision.\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\nCWE-405 was not selected as its Class status is less preferred, and CWE-1176 (child of CWE-405) is a better fit to the description.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\nCWE-183 was not selected because the description doesn't suggest any issues with the product using a protection mechanism that relies on a permissive list of allowed inputs.\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\nCWE-653 was not selected because the vulnerability description doesn't indicate any issues with isolating or compartmentalizing functionality, processes, or resources.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\nCWE-184 was not selected because the description doesn't suggest any issues with the product using a protection mechanism that relies on an incomplete list of disallowed inputs.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\nCWE-274 was not selected because the vulnerability description doesn't indicate any issues with the product incorrectly handling when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\nCWE-668 was not selected because the description doesn't indicate any issues with exposing a resource to the wrong control sphere.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\nCWE-280 was not selected because the vulnerability description doesn't indicate any issues with the product incorrectly handling when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\nCWE-41 was not selected because the description doesn't suggest any path equivalence issues.\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\nCWE-22 was not selected because the vulnerability description doesn't suggest any path traversal issues.\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\nCWE-23 was not selected because the vulnerability description doesn't suggest any path traversal issues.\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\nCWE-863 was not selected because the vulnerability description doesn't indicate any authorization issues.\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\nCWE-770 was selected as a secondary weakness because it is a child of CWE-400.
