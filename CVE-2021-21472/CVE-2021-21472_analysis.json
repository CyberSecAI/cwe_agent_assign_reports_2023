CWE-1393 is a child of CWE-1392, \"Use of Password-Based Authentication,\" indicating a more specific scenario related to default passwords. CWE-22 is related to one of the impacts listed which is directory traversal.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1393[\"CWE-1393: Use of Default Password\"]\n    cwe1392[\"CWE-1392: Use of Password-Based Authentication\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n\n    cwe1393 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1392\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1393 primary\n    class cwe22 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of a password setting option** during installation (CWE-1393), which allows for attacks like Directory Traversal (CWE-22), Password Brute force Attack, SMB Relay attack, and Security Downgrade.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-1393 as the primary weakness due to the **lack of a password setting option** during installation, as indicated in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\". This directly aligns with the description of CWE-1393, \"Use of Default Password,\" which states that the product uses default passwords for potentially critical functionality. The \"Retriever Results\" also listed CWE-1393 with a high score of 0.515, which is the highest score.\n\nThe vulnerability description also mentions \"Directory Traversal\" as an impact. CWE-22, \"Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\", is added as a secondary candidate as it is listed as one of the impacts of the vulnerability, but the **rootcause** is the **lack of a password setting option**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1393 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability, the **lack of password setting option** during installation. The evidence is explicitly stated in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\": \"**rootcause:** **lack of password setting option**\".\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
