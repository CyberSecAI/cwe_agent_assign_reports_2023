It has child relationships to CWE-285 and CWE-284, both of which are improper authorization CWEs, but less specific. CWE-668 is a class level CWE that is discouraged. CWE-1230 is a base level CWE which is more specific, however the description focuses on exposure of *sensitive* information, whereas the vulnerability description is clear that only *non-sensitive* metadata is exposed.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe1230[\"CWE-1230: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Metadata\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|ChildOf| cwe284\n    cwe1230 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe668,cwe1230 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper authorization** where a workload identity token can list non-sensitive metadata of other jobs in the same namespace. This leads to **exposure of metadata**, which, while non-sensitive, could provide context to an attacker.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **improper authorization** aspect. The vulnerability allows a workload identity token to list metadata for paths belonging to other jobs in the same namespace. The fact that only non-sensitive metadata is exposed is a key factor.\n\nThe primary CWE candidate is CWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**). The vulnerability description clearly states that the **improper authorization** logic allows listing metadata of other jobs. This matches the description of CWE-863: \"The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\"\n\nCWE-668 (**Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere**) was considered but ultimately not selected as the primary CWE. While the vulnerability does involve exposure of metadata, CWE-668 is a high-level class and is discouraged. The root cause is more specifically related to **incorrect authorization**, making CWE-863 a better fit.\n\nCWE-1230 (**Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Metadata**) was also considered. However, the vulnerability description emphasizes that the exposed metadata is *non-sensitive*. CWE-1230 specifically deals with *sensitive* information, making it less appropriate.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-863 is based on the evidence that the **incorrect authorization** check is the root cause of the vulnerability, and the exposed metadata is explicitly stated as non-sensitive. The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, as it captures the essence of the vulnerability without being overly broad or narrow.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
