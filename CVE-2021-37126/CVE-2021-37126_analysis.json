The **directory traversal** is the key aspect of the vulnerability. |\n| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. The **impact** is the **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the choice of CWE-22 is its connection to path traversal, as it directly addresses the vulnerability's mechanism. CWE-200 is included as a secondary CWE because it reflects the impact of the vulnerability but is a higher-level abstraction. The hierarchical relationships (ChildOf) and chain relationships (CanFollow) were considered but did not lead to the selection of additional CWEs, as CWE-22 and CWE-200 adequately capture the root cause and impact.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe22 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe668 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with the **improper limitation of a pathname** (CWE-22), which allows an attacker to perform **directory traversal**. This then leads to the **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200) to an unauthorized actor.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which indicates a directory traversal vulnerability leading to the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nThe key phrases from the description are \"**impact:** Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\" and \"**vector:** directory traversal\".\n\nCWE-22 accurately describes the **root cause** of the vulnerability, as it specifically addresses the **improper limitation of a pathname** that leads to directory traversal. CWE-200 is included because the description explicitly mentions **exposure of sensitive information**, although it's a more general impact.\n\nThe selection of CWE-22 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly relates to the technical weakness described in the vulnerability. While other CWEs like CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) were considered, they are higher-level and less specific than CWE-22. CWE-200, though also high-level, is included to represent the described impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
