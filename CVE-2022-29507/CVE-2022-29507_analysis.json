It is related to CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) via a ChildOf relationship, meaning CWE-256 is a more specific type of CWE-522. CWE-522 is also a ChildOf CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe522 primary\n    class cwe256,cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficiently protected credentials**, leading to potential information disclosure via local access.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Insufficiently protected credentials** (CWE-522)\n  - **Impact:** Information Disclosure\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identifies CWE-522 as the primary weakness, due to the vulnerability description stating \"**Insufficiently protected credentials**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also explicitly mentions \"Insufficiently protected credentials\" as the root cause and weakness.\n\nCWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is chosen as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**Insufficiently protected credentials**\" as the root cause. The description states: \"**Insufficiently protected credentials** in the Intel(R) Team Blue mobile application in all versions may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.\"\nThe summary of the CVE also mentions: \"Insufficiently protected credentials in the Intel(R) Team Blue mobile application\" as the root cause. The retriever results also list CWE-522 as the top combined result.\n\nCWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) was considered because storing a password in plaintext would qualify as insufficiently protected credentials. However, there isn't enough information in the provided description to confirm that the credentials are being stored in plaintext, so it's a possible but unconfirmed root cause.\n\nCWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) was considered since insufficiently protected credentials could lead to exposing resources to the wrong sphere. However, this is a higher-level classification, and CWE-522 is more specific to the identified weakness.\n\nThe selection of CWE-522 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the **root cause** described in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30018:** A messaging platform serializes all elements of User/Group objects, making private information available to adversaries\n- **CVE-2022-29959:** Initialization file contains credentials that can be decoded using a \"simple string transformation\"\n- **CVE-2022-35411:** Python-based RPC framework enables pickle functionality by default, allowing clients to unpickle untrusted data.",
