It has a ChildOf relationship to CWE-684 (Inappropriately High Resource Consumption). The abstraction level influenced the selection, with a preference for a more specific Base or Variant if available.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe912[\"CWE-912: Hidden Functionality\"]\n    cwe684[\"CWE-684: Inappropriately High Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe912 -->|CHILDOF| cwe684\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe912 primary\n    class cwe684 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability involves a **non-NULL k value** leading to the export of collection metadata. The chain starts with the existence of **hidden functionality**, which is then exploited to export sensitive data.\n  - **Root Cause:** Hidden functionality (CWE-912)\n  - **Impact:** Export collection metadata\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified several potential CWEs, including CWE-1236 (Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File), CWE-252 (Unchecked Return Value), CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference), CWE-824 (Access of Uninitialized Pointer), CWE-23 (Relative Path Traversal), CWE-617 (Reachable Assertion), CWE-456 (Missing Initialization of a Variable), and CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code).\n\nHowever, based on the description \"**non-NULL k value**\", the best fit seems to be CWE-912 (Hidden Functionality).\nThe vulnerability description states, \"csv_export_results_metadata.php allows attackers to export collection metadata via a **non-NULL k value**.\" This suggests the presence of an undocumented or unexpected means of accessing the export functionality, which aligns with the definition of CWE-912. The \"**non-NULL k value**\" is the weakness.\n\nI am selecting CWE-912 because the vulnerability description explicitly states that there is a way to export collection metadata via a **non-NULL k value**, suggesting that it is not part of the obvious interface for using the ResourceSpace application. This is the weakness.\nI am setting the confidence to 0.7 due to the lack of more explicit information in the description and the NOINFO status of the CVE Reference Links Content Summary section.\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n- CWE-1236: Ruled out because the vulnerability doesn't involve improper neutralization of formula elements in a CSV file.\n- CWE-252: Ruled out because there is no explicit mention of unchecked return values.\n- CWE-476: Ruled out because there is no explicit mention of null pointer dereference.\n- CWE-824: Ruled out because there is no explicit mention of access of uninitialized pointer.\n- CWE-23: Ruled out because there is no explicit mention of path traversal.\n- CWE-617: Ruled out because there is no explicit mention of reachable assertion.\n- CWE-456: Ruled out because there is no explicit mention of missing initialization of a variable.\n- CWE-393: Ruled out because there is no explicit mention of wrong status code.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
