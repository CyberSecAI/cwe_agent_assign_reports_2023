# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-912: Hidden Functionality
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product contains functionality that is not documented, not part of the specification, and not accessible through an interface or command sequence that is obvious to the product's users or administrators.

### Extended Description
Hidden functionality can take many forms, such as intentionally malicious code, "Easter Eggs" that contain extraneous functionality such as games, developer-friendly shortcuts that reduce maintenance or support costs such as hard-coded accounts, etc. From a security perspective, even when the functionality is not intentionally malicious or damaging, it can increase the product's attack surface and expose additional weaknesses beyond what is already exposed by the intended functionality. Even if it is not easily accessible, the hidden functionality could be useful for attacks that modify the control flow of the application.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-684

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-31260:** Chain: a digital asset management program has an undisclosed backdoor in the legacy version of a PHP script (CWE-912) that could allow an unauthenticated user to export metadata (CWE-306)
- **CVE-2022-3203:** A wireless access point manual specifies that the only method of configuration is via web interface (CWE-1059), but there is an undisclosed telnet server that was activated by default (CWE-912).




## CWE-158: Improper Neutralization of Null Byte or NUL Character
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes NUL characters or null bytes when they are sent to a downstream component.

### Extended Description
As data is parsed, an injected NUL character or null byte may cause the product to believe the input is terminated earlier than it actually is, or otherwise cause the input to be misinterpreted. This could then be used to inject potentially dangerous input that occurs after the null byte or otherwise bypass validation routines and other protection mechanisms.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-138

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be a factor in multiple interpretation errors, other interaction errors, filename equivalence, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2008-1284:** NUL byte in theme name causes directory traversal impact to be worse
- **CVE-2005-2008:** Source code disclosure using trailing null.
- **CVE-2005-3293:** Source code disclosure using trailing null.




## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

### Extended Description


If the pointer contains an uninitialized value, then the value might not point to a valid memory location. This could cause the product to read from or write to unexpected memory locations, leading to a denial of service. If the uninitialized pointer is used as a function call, then arbitrary functions could be invoked. If an attacker can influence the portion of uninitialized memory that is contained in the pointer, this weakness could be leveraged to execute code or perform other attacks.


Depending on memory layout, associated memory management behaviors, and product operation, the attacker might be able to influence the contents of the uninitialized pointer, thus gaining more fine-grained control of the memory location to be accessed.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.

**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of "memory corruption" or "memory safety." As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-32878:** LLM product has a free of an uninitialized pointer
- **CVE-2010-0211:** chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) leads to free of invalid, uninitialized pointer (CWE-824).
- **CVE-2009-2768:** Pointer in structure is not initialized, leading to NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) and system crash.




## CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
NPD: Common abbreviation for Null Pointer Dereference
null deref: Common abbreviation for Null Pointer Dereference

- **CVE-2005-0772:** packet with invalid error status value triggers NULL dereference




## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

### Extended Description
This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.

### Alternative Terms
Zip Slip: "Zip slip" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282]. It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).

- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)
- **CVE-2019-20916:** Python package manager does not correctly restrict the filename specified in a Content-Disposition header, allowing arbitrary file read using path traversal sequences such as "../"




## CWE-1236: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product saves user-provided information into a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as a command when the file is opened by a spreadsheet product.

### Extended Description
User-provided data is often saved to traditional databases. This data can be exported to a CSV file, which allows users to read the data using spreadsheet software such as Excel, Numbers, or Calc. This software interprets entries beginning with '=' as formulas, which are then executed by the spreadsheet software. The software's formula language often allows methods to access hyperlinks or the local command line, and frequently allows enough characters to invoke an entire script. Attackers can populate data fields which, when saved to a CSV file, may attempt information exfiltration or other malicious activity when automatically executed by the spreadsheet software.

### Alternative Terms
CSV Injection
Formula Injection
Excel Macro Injection

### Relationships

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-12134:** Low privileged user can trigger CSV injection through a contact form field value
- **CVE-2019-4521:** Cloud management product allows arbitrary command execution via CSV injection
- **CVE-2019-17661:** CSV injection in content management system via formula code in a first or last name




## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.

### Extended Description
Two common programmer assumptions are "this function call can never fail" and "it doesn't matter if this function call fails". If an attacker can force the function to fail or otherwise return a value that is not expected, then the subsequent program logic could lead to a vulnerability, because the product is not in a state that the programmer assumes. For example, if the program calls a function to drop privileges but does not check the return code to ensure that privileges were successfully dropped, then the program will continue to operate with the higher privileges.

### Alternative Terms
None

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-17533:** Chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) of some functions for policy enforcement leads to authorization bypass (CWE-862)
- **CVE-2020-6078:** Chain: The return value of a function returning a pointer is not checked for success (CWE-252) resulting in the later use of an uninitialized variable (CWE-456) and a null pointer dereference (CWE-476)
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).




## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.

### Extended Description


While assertion is good for catching logic errors and reducing the chances of reaching more serious vulnerability conditions, it can still lead to a denial of service.


For example, if a server handles multiple simultaneous connections, and an assert() occurs in one single connection that causes all other connections to be dropped, this is a reachable assertion that leads to a denial of service.


### Alternative Terms
assertion failure

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness is a major factor in a number of resultant weaknesses, especially in web applications that allow global variable initialization (such as PHP) with libraries that can be directly requested.

**[Research Gap]** It is highly likely that a large number of resultant weaknesses have missing initialization as a primary factor, but researcher reports generally do not provide this level of detail.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-6078:** Chain: The return value of a function returning a pointer is not checked for success (CWE-252) resulting in the later use of an uninitialized variable (CWE-456) and a null pointer dereference (CWE-476)
- **CVE-2009-2692:** Chain: Use of an unimplemented network socket operation pointing to an uninitialized handler function (CWE-456) causes a crash because of a null pointer dereference (CWE-476).
- **CVE-2020-20739:** A variable that has its value set in a conditional statement is sometimes used when the conditional fails, sometimes causing data leakage




## CWE-393: Return of Wrong Status Code
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A function or operation returns an incorrect return value or status code that does not indicate an error, but causes the product to modify its behavior based on the incorrect result.

### Extended Description
This can lead to unpredictable behavior. If the function is used to make security-critical decisions or provide security-critical information, then the wrong status code can cause the product to assume that an action is safe, even when it is not.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-684
ChildOf -> CWE-703

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be primary or resultant, but it is probably most often primary to other issues.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2003-1132:** DNS server returns wrong response code for non-existent AAAA record, which effectively says that the domain is inaccessible.
- **CVE-2001-1509:** Hardware-specific implementation of system call causes incorrect results from geteuid.
- **CVE-2001-1559:** Chain: System call returns wrong value (CWE-393), leading to a resultant NULL dereference (CWE-476).
