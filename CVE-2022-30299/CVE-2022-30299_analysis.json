It has parent relationships with CWE-706 and CWE-668, reflecting how it fits into broader categories of resource handling and control sphere issues. CWE-23 [Relative Path Traversal] is a child of CWE-22, representing a more specific case, but CWE-22 is a better fit because the description does not specify that relative path traversal is the only method of exploiting the vulnerability. CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] is a Class level CWE representing the impact of the Path Traversal, but is less specific to the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe23[\"CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe706[\"CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference\"]\n    \n    cwe23 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    cwe22 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe22 -->|CHILDOF| cwe706\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe23,cwe668,cwe706 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Path Traversal** [CWE-22] vulnerability, which allows an attacker to **retrieve specific parts of files** from the underlying file system, leading to **Exposure of Sensitive Information** [CWE-200].\n  - The root cause is the **improper limitation of a pathname**, which enables the exploit\n  - The weakness is the ability to **retrieve files** due to the path traversal\n  - The impact is the **exposure of sensitive information**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points to CWE-22 [Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')] as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary both explicitly state a **path traversal** issue.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"A **path traversal** vulnerability [CWE-23] in the API of FortiWeb...may allow an authenticated attacker to **retrieve specific parts of files** from the underlying file system via specially crafted web requests.\"\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"The vulnerability is due to a **path traversal** issue in the web API of FortiWeb.\" and \"**Path Traversal (CWE-23):** The web API is susceptible to path traversal, which allows an attacker to navigate the file system outside of the intended directory.\"\n\nThe Retriever Results also strongly support CWE-22, with a score of 1.0. While CWE-23 [Relative Path Traversal] is also listed, CWE-22 is more appropriate as the description does not limit the traversal to only relative paths.\n\nCWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] is considered as a secondary weakness, as it represents the impact of the path traversal. However, CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE and is often misused. It's included here to represent the information disclosure aspect, but the focus remains on the root cause, which is the path traversal.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-22 being a Base-level CWE directly addressing the **path traversal** root cause, and CWE-200 representing the resulting information exposure.\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-23 [Relative Path Traversal]: While related, the vulnerability description doesn't explicitly limit the traversal to relative paths, making CWE-22 a broader and more accurate fit.\n*   CWE-639 [Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key]: This CWE is related to authorization bypass, but the primary issue is path traversal, not a flaw in authorization mechanisms.\n*   CWE-113 [Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')]: This is not relevant as the vulnerability is about path traversal, not HTTP header manipulation.\n* CWE-78 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')]: This is not relevant as the vulnerability is about path traversal, not OS Command injection.",
