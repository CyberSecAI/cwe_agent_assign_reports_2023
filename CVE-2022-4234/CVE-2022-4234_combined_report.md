## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper input sanitization**, leading to the XSS vulnerability.
  - Root Cause: **Improper Input Sanitization**
  - Weakness: CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
  - Impact: Cross-site scripting vulnerability

## Summary of Analysis
The primary assessment is based on the provided evidence which clearly indicates an XSS vulnerability due to **improper input sanitization**.

The "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" section explicitly states:
- **rootcause:** **improper input sanitization**
- **impact:** cross site scripting

The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section supports this by stating:
- The application fails to properly neutralize user-supplied input, specifically the `brand_name` argument, before using it in the output of a web page.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue (CWE-79). The application doesn't sanitize user-provided input, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the output.
- **Improper Neutralization of Input:** The system does not neutralize user-controllable input before placing it into the output, leading to the XSS.

CWE-79 is selected as the primary CWE due to its direct relation to the **improper input sanitization** and resulting XSS vulnerability. CWE-184 is considered a secondary factor as the **improper input sanitization** could be the result of an incomplete list of disallowed inputs.

CWE-79 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) for the described vulnerability.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

### Extended Description


Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:


  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.

  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.

  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.

  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.

  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.

  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.

There are three main kinds of XSS:

  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.

  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. 

  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. 

Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as "drive-by hacking."

In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.


### Alternative Terms
XSS: A common abbreviation for Cross-Site Scripting.
HTML Injection: Used as a synonym of stored (Type 2) XSS.
CSS: In the early years after initial discovery of XSS, "CSS" was a commonly-used acronym. However, this would cause confusion with "Cascading Style Sheets," so usage of this acronym has declined significantly.

ChildOf -> CWE-74
CanPrecede -> CWE-494
PeerOf -> CWE-352

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

There can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.


**[Applicable Platform]** 

XSS flaws are very common in web applications, since they require a great deal of developer discipline to avoid them.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-25926:** Python Library Manager did not sufficiently neutralize a user-supplied search term, allowing reflected XSS.
- **CVE-2021-25963:** Python-based e-commerce platform did not escape returned content on error pages, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.
- **CVE-2021-1879:** Universal XSS in mobile operating system, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
SQL injection: a common attack-oriented phrase
SQLi: a common abbreviation for "SQL injection"

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-943

**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** SQL injection can be resultant from special character mismanagement, MAID, or denylist/allowlist problems. It can be primary to authentication errors.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-32530:** SQL injection in security product dashboard using crafted certificate fields
- **CVE-2021-42258:** SQL injection in time and billing software, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-27101:** SQL injection in file-transfer system via a crafted Host header, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Unrestricted File Upload: Used in vulnerability databases and elsewhere, but it is insufficiently precise. The phrase could be interpreted as the lack of restrictions on the size or number of uploaded files, which is a resource consumption issue.

### Relationships

**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

This can have a chaining relationship with incomplete denylist / permissive allowlist errors when the product tries, but fails, to properly limit which types of files are allowed (CWE-183, CWE-184).


This can also overlap multiple interpretation errors for intermediaries, e.g. anti-virus products that do not remove or quarantine attachments with certain file extensions that can be processed by client systems.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-5227:** PHP-based FAQ management app does not check the MIME type for uploaded images
- **CVE-2001-0901:** Web-based mail product stores ".shtml" attachments that could contain SSI
- **CVE-2002-1841:** PHP upload does not restrict file types




## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction:** Compound
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

### Extended Description
When a web server is designed to receive a request from a client without any mechanism for verifying that it was intentionally sent, then it might be possible for an attacker to trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server which will be treated as an authentic request. This can be done via a URL, image load, XMLHttpRequest, etc. and can result in exposure of data or unintended code execution.

### Alternative Terms
Session Riding
Cross Site Reference Forgery
XSRF

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-345
ChildOf -> CWE-345
Requires -> CWE-346
Requires -> CWE-441
Requires -> CWE-642
Requires -> CWE-613

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.
**Comments:** While attack-oriented composites are supported in CWE, they have not been a focus of research. There is a chance that future research or CWE scope clarifications will change or deprecate them. Perform root-cause analysis to determine if other weaknesses allow CSRF attacks to occur, and map to those weaknesses. For example, predictable CSRF tokens might allow bypass of CSRF protection mechanisms; if this occurs, they might be better characterized as randomness/predictability weaknesses.
**Reasons:**
- Other


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

There can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.


**[Theoretical]** 

The CSRF topology is multi-channel:


  - Attacker (as outsider) to intermediary (as user). The interaction point is either an external or internal channel.

  - Intermediary (as user) to server (as victim). The activation point is an internal channel.





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2004-1703:** Add user accounts via a URL in an img tag
- **CVE-2004-1995:** Add user accounts via a URL in an img tag
- **CVE-2004-1967:** Arbitrary code execution by specifying the code in a crafted img tag or URL




## CWE-1241: Use of Predictable Algorithm in Random Number Generator
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The device uses an algorithm that is predictable and generates a pseudo-random number.

### Extended Description


Pseudo-random number generator algorithms are predictable because their registers have a finite number of possible states, which eventually lead to repeating patterns. As a result, pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) can compromise their randomness or expose their internal state to various attacks, such as reverse engineering or tampering. It is highly recommended to use hardware-based true random number generators (TRNGs) to ensure the security of encryption schemes. TRNGs generate unpredictable, unbiased, and independent random numbers because they employ physical phenomena, e.g., electrical noise, as sources to generate random numbers.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-330

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, "randomness" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-3692:** PHP framework uses mt_rand() function (Marsenne Twister) when generating tokens




## CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-94

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** "HTML injection" (see CWE-79: XSS) could be thought of as an example of this, but the code is injected and executed on the client side, not the server side. Server-Side Includes (SSI) are an example of direct static code injection.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-0495:** Perl code directly injected into CGI library file from parameters to another CGI program.
- **CVE-2005-1876:** Direct PHP code injection into supporting template file.
- **CVE-2005-1894:** Direct code injection into PHP script that can be accessed by attacker.




## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Denylist / Deny List: This is used by CWE and CAPEC instead of other commonly-used terms. Its counterpart is allowlist.
Blocklist / Block List: This is often used by security tools such as firewalls, email or web gateways, proxies, etc.
Blacklist / Black List: This term is frequently used, but usage has been declining as organizations have started to adopt other terms.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

Multiple interpretation errors can indirectly introduce inputs that should be disallowed. For example, a list of dangerous shell metacharacters might not include a metacharacter that only has meaning in one particular shell, not all of them; or a check for XSS manipulations might ignore an unusual construct that is supported by one web browser, but not others.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the "\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.
- **CVE-2008-2309:** product uses a denylist to identify potentially dangerous content, allowing attacker to bypass a warning
- **CVE-2005-2782:** PHP remote file inclusion in web application that filters "http" and "https" URLs, but not "ftp".




## CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

### Extended Description
This may allow such characters to be treated as control characters, which are executed client-side in the context of the user's session. Although this can be classified as an injection problem, the more pertinent issue is the improper conversion of such special characters to respective context-appropriate entities before displaying them to the user.
