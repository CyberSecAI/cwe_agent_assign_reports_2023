The description mentions parsing avi files as the vector, and the impact is information disclosure.\n\nThe selection of CWE-126 is based on the explicit mention of \"**buffer over-read**\" in the vulnerability description key phrases. The \"**rootcause**\" is identified as \"**buffer over-read**\".\n\nCWE-126: Buffer Over-read is the most appropriate CWE because it accurately describes the vulnerability. It is a variant of \"Out-of-bounds Read\" (CWE-125), indicating that the read occurs beyond the intended buffer boundaries.

This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-1733:** Text editor has out-of-bounds read past end of line while indenting C code\n- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: \"Heartbleed\" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.\n\nI considered other CWEs such as CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), CWE-822 (Untrusted Pointer Dereference), and CWE-823 (Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset).
