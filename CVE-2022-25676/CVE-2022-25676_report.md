# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2022-25676

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-126 | Buffer Over-read | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is the ChildOf relationship between CWE-126 and its parent CWEs (CWE-125 and CWE-788). CWE-126 is a variant of the more general "Out-of-bounds Read" (CWE-125), specifying that the read occurs after the targeted buffer.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain involves a **buffer over-read** while parsing avi files, leading to information disclosure.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description explicitly states "**buffer over-read**", which directly corresponds to CWE-126. The description mentions parsing avi files as the vector, and the impact is information disclosure.

The selection of CWE-126 is based on the explicit mention of "**buffer over-read**" in the vulnerability description key phrases. The "**rootcause**" is identified as "**buffer over-read**".

CWE-126: Buffer Over-read is the most appropriate CWE because it accurately describes the vulnerability. It is a variant of "Out-of-bounds Read" (CWE-125), indicating that the read occurs beyond the intended buffer boundaries. The confidence level is high (1.0) due to the direct match between the vulnerability description and the CWE definition.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.

### Extended Description
This typically occurs when the pointer or its index is incremented to a position beyond the bounds of the buffer or when pointer arithmetic results in a position outside of the valid memory location to name a few. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-1733:** Text editor has out-of-bounds read past end of line while indenting C code
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.

I considered other CWEs such as CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), CWE-822 (Untrusted Pointer Dereference), and CWE-823 (Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset). However, CWE-126 is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability because the description explicitly mentions "**buffer over-read**."
