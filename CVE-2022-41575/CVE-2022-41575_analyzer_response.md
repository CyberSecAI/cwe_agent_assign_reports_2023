# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-256 | Plaintext Storage of a Password | 1 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-532 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the selection was the hierarchical relationship between CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) and its child CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password). Given that the vulnerability explicitly involves storing credentials in plaintext, the more specific CWE-256 was chosen over its parent. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was considered as a secondary impact, resulting from the root cause of plaintext storage.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **plaintext storage** of S3 access credentials within support bundles. This leads to the **exposure** of these credentials when the support bundles are accessed by unauthorized actors. The final impact is that attackers can use these credentials to read and write Build Scan data, potentially causing data breaches or manipulation.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability based on the provided evidence. The key phrase "**credential-exposure**" and the detailed description in the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" clearly pointed to the **plaintext storage** of sensitive information.

The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" stated: "The vulnerability stems from the exposure of S3 access credentials in plaintext within support bundles generated by Gradle Enterprise." This statement provides strong evidence for the root cause being CWE-256.

The retriever results also supported this conclusion, with CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) being the top-ranked CWE. Although CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) and CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) were also considered, they were deemed secondary because they represent the impact rather than the root cause. CWE-200 is discouraged per MITRE guidance, and CWE-532 doesn't fully describe the method of exposure, as it's the support bundle, not exclusively log files.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-256 accurately describes the underlying coding error, while the other CWEs describe impacts that stem from the root cause.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.



## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.



## CWE-213: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product's intended functionality exposes information to certain actors in accordance with the developer's security policy, but this information is regarded as sensitive according to the intended security policies of other stakeholders such as the product's administrator, users, or others whose information is being processed.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-669: Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly transfer a resource/behavior to another sphere, or improperly imports a resource/behavior from another sphere, in a manner that provides unintended control over that resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an externally controlled name or reference that resolves to a resource that is outside of the intended control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-402: Transmission of Private Resources into a New Sphere ('Resource Leak')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product makes resources available to untrusted parties when those resources are only intended to be accessed by the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to
