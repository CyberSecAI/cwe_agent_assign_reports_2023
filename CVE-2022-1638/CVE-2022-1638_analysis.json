CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-787, specifically related to heap-based buffer overflows, making it a strong secondary candidate. CWE-119 is a class-level CWE that encompasses buffer overflows in general, but it is discouraged as a primary mapping when more specific CWEs like CWE-787 or CWE-122 are applicable.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe122,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **heap buffer overflow** (CWE-787), leading to potential **heap corruption** (impact).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which includes the vulnerability description, key phrases, and CVE reference summary. The core issue is identified as a **heap buffer overflow**, which directly corresponds to CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write).\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"Heap **buffer overflow** in V8 Internationalization in Google Chrome prior to 101.0.4951.64 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit **heap corruption** via a crafted HTML page.\"\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this: \"Root cause of vulnerability: Heap buffer overflow\" and \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Heap buffer overflow in V8 Internationalization.\"\n\nGiven this information, the primary CWE is CWE-787. CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is a more specific variant of CWE-787 and accurately describes the location of the buffer overflow. CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is a more general class that includes buffer overflows but is discouraged when more specific CWEs are available.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in
