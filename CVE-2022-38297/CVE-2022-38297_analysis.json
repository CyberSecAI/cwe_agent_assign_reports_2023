It is related to CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) as a child. The secondary CWE, CWE-784, focuses on the specific case of relying on cookies without proper validation. This is also a variant of CWE-807. The hierarchical relationship shows that CWE-302 is more general and CWE-784 is a specific type of CWE-302 that relies on cookies.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe302[\"CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data\"]\n    cwe784[\"CWE-784: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe807[\"CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\"]\n    \n    cwe302 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe784 -->|CHILDOF| cwe807\n    cwe302 -->|CHILDOF| cwe807\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe302 primary\n    class cwe784,cwe1390 secondary\n    class cwe807 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **authentication bypass** due to cookie poisoning. The server is **relying on cookies without validation**, allowing an attacker to modify the cookies and bypass authentication.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **authentication bypass** via cookie poisoning as the root cause. The subsequent analysis, including the retriever results, supports mapping this to CWE-302 (Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data). The vulnerability description states, \"UCMS v1.6.0 contains an **authentication bypass** vulnerability which is exploited via cookie poisoning.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicates \"The root cause is a 'cookies poisoning attack vulnerability' affecting UCMS v1.6.\"\n\nCWE-302 accurately captures the essence of the vulnerability, where the system assumes the immutability of cookie data used for authentication, which can be modified by an attacker. CWE-784 is a more specific variant of CWE-807 and a more specific type of the primary weakness.\n\nThe retriever also suggested CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) which is a parent of CWE-302, but CWE-302 is more descriptive.\n\nI am overriding the retriever which gave a higher rating to CWE-784, since the evidence points to the more general CWE-302.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-784: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.132\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of a cookie, but it does not properly ensure that the cookie is valid for the associated user.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Explanation of Selected CWEs:\n\n*   **CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data**\n    *   The vulnerability involves **authentication bypass** by manipulating cookies, which are assumed to be immutable for authentication purposes.\n    *   The security implication is unauthorized access to the system.\n    *   CWE-302 is a child of CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) and CWE-807 (Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision).\n    *   This is the primary weakness.\n    *   MITRE mapping guidance ALLOWED.\n*   **CWE-784: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision**\n    *   The vulnerability involves a reliance on cookies for a security decision (authentication) without proper validation.\n    *   The security implication is **authentication bypass** or privilege escalation.\n    *   CWE-784 is a more specific case of CWE-807.\n    *   This is a secondary candidate.\n    *   MITRE mapping guidance ALLOWED.\n*   **CWE-1390: Weak Authentication**\n    *   The vulnerability involves a weakness in the authentication mechanism, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication.\n    *   The security implication is unauthorized access to the system.\n    *   CWE-1390 is a Class-level weakness, and CWE-302 is a more specific child.\n    *   This is a secondary candidate.\n    *   MITRE mapping guidance ALLOWED-WITH-REVIEW.\n\n### Explanation of Other Considered CWEs:\n\n*   **CWE-287: Improper Authentication** - This is a very general class and less descriptive than CWE-302 and therefore is not a good fit.
