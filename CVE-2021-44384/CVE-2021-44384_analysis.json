The relationship influenced the decision by guiding the selection of a more specific CWE (CWE-1287) over its more general parent (CWE-20).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1287[\"CWE-1287: Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe1287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1287 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of validation of the input type**, which leads to an assertion failure and finally a reboot (DoS).\n  - Root Cause: **Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input** (CWE-1287)\n  - Impact: Denial of Service (DoS)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified a denial of service vulnerability due to improper input validation. The `SetPtzTattern` command parser assumes that the `param` JSON element is an object but doesn't validate this assumption. When a string or other non-object is provided, it leads to an assertion failure and device reboot.\n\nThe retriever results suggested CWE-1287 (Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input), CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), and other CWEs. After reviewing the descriptions and mapping guidance, CWE-1287 was selected as the primary CWE because it specifically addresses the **lack of type validation**, aligning perfectly with the vulnerability's **root cause**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" mentions: \"The code does not validate the type of the 'param' JSON element before accessing it as an object.\"\n\nCWE-20 was considered as well, but the mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available. Since CWE-1287 directly addresses the type validation issue, it's the more appropriate choice.\n\nThe relationship between CWE-1287 and CWE-20 (child-parent) reinforced the decision to prioritize the more specific child CWE.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-1287 is based on the direct evidence of **missing type validation** and the mapping guidance's recommendation to use the most specific CWE available.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives a complex input with multiple elements or fields that must be consistent with each other, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually consistent.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
