# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Discouraged |
| CWE-770 | Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |
| CWE-410 | Insufficient Resource Pool | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-400. Although it is discouraged, the CVE description and summary clearly indicate an **uncontrolled resource consumption** issue, which makes it a suitable, albeit high-level, starting point.
CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) and CWE-410 (Insufficient Resource Pool) are both related to CWE-400 as children and provide more specific details about the resource allocation issue.
CWE-770 describes the lack of limits, while CWE-410 describes a resource pool that is too small.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400). This leads to blocking new communication channel connections, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
Specifically, the system allows unlimited TCP connections (CWE-770), which leads to an exhaustion of available communication channels (CWE-410) and ultimately prevents legitimate users from connecting.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified CWE-400 as a potential match due to the vulnerability description's focus on **uncontrolled resource consumption**. However, CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE and is discouraged due to its generality. A more specific CWE is preferred.

The CVE summary provides more detail: the CODESYS runtime system allows a limited number of incoming TCP connections, and an attacker can exhaust these connections. This points to a lack of proper resource management, making CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) and CWE-410 (Insufficient Resource Pool) relevant.

The graph relationships show that CWE-770 and CWE-410 are children of CWE-400, providing a more granular view of the vulnerability.

The selected CWEs are at a suitable level of specificity, capturing the root cause of the vulnerability (lack of resource control) and the specific mechanism (exhaustion of communication channels).

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is "asymmetric."

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.

## CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, i.e., after the resource is no longer needed.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
An algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 5964.06
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry
