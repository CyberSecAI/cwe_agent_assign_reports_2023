While it's discouraged, it's the best fit given the provided information. Secondary CWEs like CWE-784 and CWE-73 provide more specific potential root causes. CWE-784 focuses on the validation of cookies, while CWE-73 addresses external control of file names or paths. These relationships help provide a more complete understanding of the vulnerability, but without more specific details on the root cause, CWE-200 remains the most appropriate primary classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe784[\"CWE-784: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    \n    cwe784 -->|CHILDOF| cwe807[\"CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\"]\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe59[\"CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\"]\n\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe784,cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a weakness that allows an attacker to create invalid requests. This leads to the exposure of potentially sensitive information. The exact nature of the **WEAKNESS** that allows the creation of invalid requests isn't fully clear from the description but could involve **External Control of File Name or Path (CWE-73)** or **Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision (CWE-784)**. The ultimate impact is **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the primary **WEAKNESS** that leads to the exposure of sensitive information. The vulnerability description states that \"PhpMyAdmin 5.1.1 and before allows an attacker to retrieve potentially sensitive information by creating invalid requests.\"\n\nBased on the provided evidence, **CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor)** is the most relevant primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the retrieval of potentially sensitive information as the impact. However, CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE and is discouraged for direct mapping when more specific CWEs are available.\n\nThe \"Retriever Results\" provide several potential candidates. **CWE-784 (Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision)** is a possible secondary **WEAKNESS**, as the description mentions the cookie section being affected. Similarly, **CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path)** could be relevant if the invalid requests involve manipulation of file names or paths.\n\nThe choice of CWE-200 is justified because the primary impact is the exposure of sensitive information. While the root cause is not explicitly stated, the provided context points to a potential issue with request validation or parameter handling, which leads to this exposure. The selection of CWE-200 acknowledges the high-level nature of the available information while still capturing the core security concern.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
