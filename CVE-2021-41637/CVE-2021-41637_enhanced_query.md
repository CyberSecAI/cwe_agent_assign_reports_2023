# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-41637

## Vulnerability Description
Weak access control permissions in MELAG FTP Server 2.2.0.4 allow the Everyone group to read the local FTP configuration file, which includes among other information the unencrypted passwords of all FTP users.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **weak access control permissions**
- **impact:** read unencrypted passwords of FTP users
- **attacker:** Everyone group
- **product:** MELAG FTP Server
- **version:** 2.2.0.4

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities found in the MELAG FTP Server:

**Vulnerability 1: User Enumeration**

*   **Root Cause:** The FTP server responds differently when a valid username is provided versus an invalid username during the `USER` command, making it possible to enumerate valid users.
*   **Weakness:** Information disclosure via different server responses.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can create a list of valid usernames, making password-based attacks easier and more effective.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending `USER` commands with different usernames to the FTP server.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Unauthenticated network access.

**Vulnerability 2: Authentication Bypass**

*   **Root Cause:** After a valid username is sent via the `USER` command, the `RefUserAccount` attribute of the connection is set to the matching user's details *before* password authentication occurs. Subsequent FTP commands, like `LIST` and `RETR`, use this `RefUserAccount` without any password validation.
*   **Weakness:** Missing authentication check on subsequent FTP commands after a username is submitted.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can access user files and directories without providing the user's password.
*   **Attack Vector:** Send a `USER` command with a valid username, followed by FTP commands such as `LIST` or `RETR`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Unauthenticated network access; valid username required

**Vulnerability 3: Path Traversal**

*   **Root Cause:** The `CWD` command implementation lacks proper input sanitization, allowing an attacker to specify paths outside of the user's base directory using `..`.
*   **Weakness:** Missing input validation for the `CWD` command
*   **Impact:** An attacker can access and read arbitrary files and directories on the host system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a `CWD` command with a path containing ".." sequences to traverse out of the user's home directory.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Authenticated access using the authentication bypass

**Vulnerability 4: Storage of Cleartext Passwords**

*   **Root Cause:** FTP user passwords are stored in plaintext in the `config.dat` file.
*   **Weakness:** Cleartext storage of sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** An attacker who has access to the config.dat file can obtain all FTP user passwords.
*   **Attack Vector:** Accessing the `config.dat` file using path traversal or local file access.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Authenticated access using the authentication bypass and path traversal or local system access to the server.

**Vulnerability 5: Weak File Permissions**

*   **Root Cause:** The `config.dat` file has overly permissive file permissions, granting "Everyone" full control.
*   **Weakness:** Insecure file permissions on a sensitive configuration file.
*   **Impact:** Any user on the local system can access and modify the `config.dat` file to compromise user accounts.
*   **Attack Vector:** Directly accessing the file through the file system.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Local system access.

**Vulnerability 6: High System Privileges**

*   **Root Cause:** The FTP server can be installed as a Windows service, which runs with "NT Authority\SYSTEM" privileges by default.
*  **Weakness:** The application running with high system privileges.
*   **Impact:** A compromised FTP server could be used to compromise the entire host system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting the existing vulnerabilities of the server process when running with elevated privileges
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Unauthenticated network access through the other vulnerabilities

**Exploitation Chain:**

The vulnerabilities can be chained together:
1.  Use user enumeration to identify valid usernames.
2.  Use the authentication bypass to access the FTP server without a password.
3.  Use path traversal to access and read the config.dat file, obtaining cleartext passwords.
4.  If the service is running as SYSTEM, the attacker has already gained elevated privileges

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
During installation, installed file permissions are set to allow anyone to modify those files.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-732
ChildOf -> CWE-732

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-1941:** Executables installed world-writable.
- **CVE-2002-1713:** Home directories installed world-readable.
- **CVE-2001-1550:** World-writable log files allow information loss; world-readable file has cleartext passwords.




## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.

### Extended Description
When a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-285
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which "permissions" are not checked, which is an "authorization" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].
**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.
- **CVE-2009-3482:** Anti-virus product sets insecure "Everyone: Full Control" permissions for files under the "Program Files" folder, allowing attackers to replace executables with Trojan horses.
- **CVE-2009-3897:** Product creates directories with 0777 permissions at installation, allowing users to gain privileges and access a socket used for authentication.




## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.

### Extended Description
Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.

### Alternative Terms

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** CWE-280 and CWE-274 are too similar. It is likely that CWE-274 will be deprecated in the future.

**[Relationship]** This can be both primary and resultant. When primary, it can expose a variety of weaknesses because a resource might not have the expected state, and subsequent operations might fail. It is often resultant from Unchecked Error Condition (CWE-391).

**[Theoretical]** Within the context of vulnerability theory, privileges and permissions are two sides of the same coin. Privileges are associated with actors, and permissions are associated with resources. To perform access control, at some point the software makes a decision about whether the actor (and the privileges that have been assigned to that actor) is allowed to access the resource (based on the permissions that have been specified for that resource).

**[Research Gap]** This type of issue is under-studied, since researchers often concentrate on whether an object has too many permissions, instead of not enough. These weaknesses are likely to appear in environments with fine-grained models for permissions and privileges, which can include operating systems and other large-scale software packages. However, even highly simplistic permission/privilege models are likely to contain these issues if the developer has not considered the possibility of access failure.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2003-0501:** Special file system allows attackers to prevent ownership/permission change of certain entries by opening the entries before calling a setuid program.
- **CVE-2004-0148:** FTP server places a user in the root directory when the user's permissions prevent access to the their own home directory.




## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-285
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.
