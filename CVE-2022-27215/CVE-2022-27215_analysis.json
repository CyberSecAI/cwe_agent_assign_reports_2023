It is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), both of which are more abstract. CWE-941 (Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel) is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-923 (Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints). It can precede CWE-406 (Insufficient Control of Network Message Volume (Network Amplification)).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe941[\"CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\"]\n    cwe923[\"CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\"]\n    cwe406[\"CWE-406: Insufficient Control of Network Message Volume (Network Amplification)\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe941 -->|CHILDOF| cwe923\n    cwe941 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe406\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284,cwe941,cwe923,cwe406 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing permission check** (CWE-862), which allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials (CWE-941).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which includes a clear description of the vulnerability, key phrases, and CVE reference links. The **root cause** of the vulnerability is a **missing permission check**, which aligns with CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). The impact of the vulnerability is that an attacker can connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials. This can be classified as CWE-941 (Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel), but only loosely.\n\nCWE-862 is a Class-level CWE, and the mapping guidance suggests examining its children for a better fit. However, none of the children of CWE-862 appear to be a better fit.\n\nCWE-941 describes a scenario where the product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor. The vulnerability description indicates the attacker can specify the URL, which aligns with this CWE.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the **root cause** and impact of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
