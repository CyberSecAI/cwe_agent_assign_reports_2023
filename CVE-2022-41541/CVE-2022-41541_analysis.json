The description clearly states that the vulnerability allows attackers to bypass authentication by replaying a previously transmitted encrypted authentication message. The Abstraction level influenced the selection by choosing the Base level CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe294[\"CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe294 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe294 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe294 primary\n    class cwe1390,cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of the **improper use of authentication token** leading to the ability to login as an admin user through a replay attack.\n  - **Root Cause**: **Improper Use of Authentication Token**/**Lack of Replay Protection**\n  - **Weakness**: Authentication Bypass\n  - **Impact**: Unauthorized Admin Access\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence which clearly points towards a replay attack vulnerability. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly mentions the \"lack of measures to prevent replay attacks\". The vulnerability description key phrases also note the **\"improper use of authentication token\"** as a rootcause.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by confirming that **CWE-294 (Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay)** is a more specific child of broader authentication-related CWEs.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the vulnerability mechanism - the ability to bypass authentication by replaying captured authentication messages.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were
