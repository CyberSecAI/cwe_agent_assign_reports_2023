CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400. This hierarchical relationship suggests a path from a general resource consumption issue (CWE-400) to a more specific problem of allocating memory with an excessive size (CWE-789). The vulnerability chain includes the lack of validation of input that specifies the size, which leads to memory allocation with an excessive size, which in turn leads to denial of service.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe789\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    classDef quartenary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n\n    class cwe789 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n    class cwe400 tertiary\n    class cwe1284 quartenary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the improper handling of deserialized `JsonNode` objects through JDK serialization. The attacker can craft a malicious payload that leads to:\n1.  **Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (CWE-1284)**: The input stream contains a size or quantity that is not properly validated.\n2.  **Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value (CWE-789)**: The system attempts to allocate a large amount of memory based on the attacker-controlled size, without proper checks.\n3.  **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)**: The excessive memory allocation leads to resource exhaustion.\n4.  **Denial of Service (Impact)**: The exhaustion of memory resources results in a denial-of-service condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly suggests CWE-789 as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description and the retriever results. The description explicitly mentions \"2 GB transient heap usage per read,\" indicating a memory allocation issue. The **root cause** involves **improper handling of deserialized JsonNode objects** through JDK serialization, allowing a crafted payload to cause excessive heap memory usage.\n\nThe final decision is based on:\n1.  **Evidence:** The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly states that the vulnerability allows for \"excessive heap memory usage during deserialization,\" leading to a denial of service.\n2.  **Relationship Analysis:** The hierarchical relationship between CWE-400, CWE-770, and CWE-789 helps to narrow down the specific weakness. CWE-789 is a variant of CWE-770, which is a child of CWE-400.\n3.  **Mapping Guidance:** CWE-789 is a Variant, which is a preferred level of abstraction. The mapping guidance for CWE-789 allows its usage.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because:\n*   CWE-789 directly reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the memory allocation with an excessive size value.\n*   CWE-770 provides a broader context of allocating resources without limits or throttling.\n*   CWE-400 represents the high-level consequence of the vulnerability, which is uncontrolled resource consumption.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this

transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**:
