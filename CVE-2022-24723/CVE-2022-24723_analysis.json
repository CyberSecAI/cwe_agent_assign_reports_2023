The selection of CWE-156 as the primary weakness is based on the fact that it specifically addresses the vulnerability of **improper neutralization of whitespace**, which is the **root cause** described in the vulnerability description. CWE-20 is a high level class that broadly applies to improper input validation and is a parent of CWE-156, but lacks the specificity to describe the vulnerability accurately.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe156[\"CWE-156: Improper Neutralization of Whitespace\"]\n    cwe138[\"CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe156 -->|CHILDOF| cwe138\n    cwe138 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe156 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n    class cwe138 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events in this vulnerability is as follows:\n  1. **Root Cause:** The URI.js library **fails to remove leading whitespace from the beginning of the protocol** in a URL. (CWE-156)\n  2. **Weakness:** This **improper input validation** leads to URLs not being parsed properly. (CWE-20)\n  3. **Impact:** Applications relying on URI.js for URL parsing may exhibit unexpected behavior.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified that the **root cause** of the vulnerability is the URI.js library's **failure to remove leading whitespace** from the beginning of a URL's protocol string. This leads to a vulnerability where protocol validation can be bypassed because the parser does not recognize the protocol due to leading whitespace.\n\nThe evidence for this assessment is derived from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section, which states: \" **rootcause:** **whitespace characters are not removed from the beginning of the protocol**\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which states: \"The vulnerability stems from the URI.js library's failure to properly remove leading whitespace characters from the beginning of a URL's protocol string. This causes the URL parsing to fail, and protocol validation mechanisms can be bypassed.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by illustrating that CWE-156 is a more specific variant of CWE-138, which in turn is a child of the more general CWE-20. Since the vulnerability description clearly indicates that the issue is related to whitespace, CWE-156 is the most appropriate choice.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-156 directly addresses the **improper neutralization of whitespace**, while CWE-20 provides a broader classification of **improper input validation**. The specificity of CWE-156 makes it the most accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction,

entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of

the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize

or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
