The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the use of a **broken or risky cryptographic algorithm**. |\n| CWE-1240 | Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. This CWE is a child of CWE-327 and provides more specific details about the implementation of the algorithm. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-327, a Class-level CWE. A more specific, Base-level CWE that is a child of CWE-327 is CWE-1240. CWE-327 describes the use of a **broken or risky cryptographic algorithm**, while CWE-1240 details the use of a cryptographic primitive with a risky implementation. This relationship influences the decision to include CWE-1240 as a secondary CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe1240[\"CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\"]\n    \n    cwe1240 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe327 primary\n    class cwe1240 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with the use of a **broken or risky cryptographic algorithm** (CWE-327/CWE-1240), which leads to a vulnerability that a remote unprivileged attacker can exploit, ultimately resulting in full system access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-327 as the primary CWE due to the explicit mention of a **broken or risky cryptographic algorithm** in the vulnerability description. The \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" also lists CWE-327 as the primary match.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-327 as the second best match after CWE-639 which is not relevant. Further analysis of the CWE relationships and the specific vulnerability details suggests that CWE-1240, a child of CWE-327, provides a more specific description of the root cause. Therefore, CWE-1240 is included as a secondary CWE.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause of the vulnerability while also providing relevant details about the implementation of the cryptographic algorithm. The assessment is primarily based on the provided evidence, including the vulnerability description, key phrases, and CVE reference links content summary.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product violates well-established principles for secure design.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
