While CWE-285 is a broader class, the vulnerability description points to a more specific issue of access control granularity, leading to the inclusion of CWE-1220 as a secondary classification. This demonstrates a parent-child relationship enhancing the overall classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe1220[\"CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe1220 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe1220 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient access controls**, leading to the **information disclosure** impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause and impact described in the vulnerability description. The key phrase \"**insufficient access controls**\" directly indicates a problem related to authorization or access control mechanisms.\n\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-285 **Improper Authorization**. The vulnerability description states \"**Insufficient access controls** in the AMD Link Android app may potentially result in information disclosure.\" The content summary states that the root cause is \"**Insufficient access controls** in the AMD Link Android app\". CWE-285 is described as: \"The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\" This aligns well with the **insufficient access controls** allowing unauthorized access to data, which is the root cause presented in the description. While CWE-285 is discouraged, it is selected as the primary since there is **insufficient information to determine the exact authorization checks** that were not performed or incorrectly performed.\n\nThe secondary CWE selected is CWE-1220 **Insufficient Granularity of Access Control**. CWE-1220 is described as: \"The product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.\" The **insufficient access controls** implies that the implemented access controls policy is not granular enough.\n\nThe selection of CWE-285 and CWE-1220 is based on the provided evidence, with the primary emphasis on the **insufficient access controls** as the root cause. The hierarchical relationship where CWE-1220 is a child of CWE-285 further validates this selection. The abstraction levels are deemed appropriate, with CWE-285 as a Class providing a general classification and CWE-1220 as a Base providing more specific detail regarding the granularity of access control.\n\nCWE-284 was considered, but it is too high level (Pillar) and the mapping guidance strongly discourages its use. CWE-274 was considered, but the mapping guidance indicates that it may be deprecated in the future. CWE-926 was considered, but it is specific to exported Android application components, and there isn't enough information to determine if this is applicable.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
