CWE-256 [Plaintext Storage of a Password] is a child of CWE-522 [Insufficiently Protected Credentials]. While CWE-522 could be considered, the description clearly indicates that the password is stored in plaintext, making CWE-256 a more specific and accurate choice. CWE-312 [Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information] is also a good candidate, but CWE-256 focuses specifically on passwords.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe256 -->|PEEROF| cwe312\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe522,cwe312 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause**, where the passwords are not encrypted before storage. This leads to the impact of information disclosure, where database users can read the data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description, indicated that the **passwords are not encrypted** in the database. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this, stating, \"The root cause is the storage of Dashlane and KeePass server passwords in plain text within the database.\"\n\nThe Retriever Results also supports this, with CWE-256 [Plaintext Storage of a Password] being the top result. The Complete CWE Specifications for CWE-256 states: \"Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.\" This aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description.\n\nCWE-522 [Insufficiently Protected Credentials] was considered, as it is a parent of CWE-256. However, the vulnerability description is specific about the passwords being stored in plaintext, making CWE-256 the more appropriate choice. CWE-312 [Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information] was also considered, but CWE-256 is more specific.\n\nThe final decision to select CWE-256 is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description, the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\", the Retriever Results, and the Complete CWE Specifications. The selection of CWE-256 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it accurately represents the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users. In fact, it should be noted that recoverable encrypted passwords provide no significant benefit over plaintext passwords since they are subject not only to reuse by malicious attackers but also by malicious insiders.
