The vulnerability involves skipping the generation of a random nonce during SASL authentication. |\n| CWE-330 | Use of Insufficiently Random Values | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability can lead to insufficient randomness being used during authentication. |\n| CWE-1204 | Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV) | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. When a remote server advertises support for channel binding during a SCRAM-based SASL authentication, an empty nonce is used by the client. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE, CWE-304, is a Base level weakness that is a child of CWE-303 (Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm) and CWE-573 (Missing Synchronization). CWE-330 is a Class level weakness and a parent of CWE-1204. CWE-1204 is a Base level weakness and a child of CWE-330. The relationship between CWE-330 and CWE-1204 is that the insufficient randomness (CWE-330) manifests as the generation of a weak initialization vector (CWE-1204).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe304[\"CWE-304: Missing Critical Step in Authentication\"]\n    cwe303[\"CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\"]\n    cwe573[\"CWE-573: Missing Synchronization\"]\n    cwe330[\"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\"]\n    cwe1204[\"CWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)\"]\n\n    cwe304 -->|CHILDOF| cwe303\n    cwe304 -->|CHILDOF| cwe573\n    cwe1204 -->|CHILDOF| cwe330\n    cwe330 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe804\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe304 primary\n    class cwe330,cwe1204 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing random nonce generation** step (CWE-304) during SCRAM-based SASL authentication. This leads to **insufficient randomness** (CWE-330), which then results in the **generation of a weak initialization vector** (CWE-1204), potentially weakening the authentication process.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-304 as the primary weakness due to the **missing step** in the authentication process. This is further supported by the description stating \"**no random nonce is generated**\". The retriever results also listed CWE-304 as the top combined result, increasing the confidence in the selection. The subsequent weaknesses of CWE-330 and CWE-1204 are included to provide a more complete picture of the vulnerability, detailing the implications of the missing step.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by illustrating the hierarchical structure of the weaknesses. While CWE-330 is a broader class, CWE-1204 provides more specific details about the weak IV.\nCWE-304 is the most specific and accurately describes the root cause, making it the most appropriate selection. The selection of CWE-304 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **missing step** in the authentication process as stated in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
