## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-304 | Missing Critical Step in Authentication | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability involves skipping the generation of a random nonce during SASL authentication. |
| CWE-330 | Use of Insufficiently Random Values | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability can lead to insufficient randomness being used during authentication. |
| CWE-1204 | Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV) | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. When a remote server advertises support for channel binding during a SCRAM-based SASL authentication, an empty nonce is used by the client. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-304, is a Base level weakness that is a child of CWE-303 (Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm) and CWE-573 (Missing Synchronization). CWE-330 is a Class level weakness and a parent of CWE-1204. CWE-1204 is a Base level weakness and a child of CWE-330. The relationship between CWE-330 and CWE-1204 is that the insufficient randomness (CWE-330) manifests as the generation of a weak initialization vector (CWE-1204).

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **missing random nonce generation** step (CWE-304) during SCRAM-based SASL authentication. This leads to **insufficient randomness** (CWE-330), which then results in the **generation of a weak initialization vector** (CWE-1204), potentially weakening the authentication process.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified CWE-304 as the primary weakness due to the **missing step** in the authentication process. This is further supported by the description stating "**no random nonce is generated**". The retriever results also listed CWE-304 as the top combined result, increasing the confidence in the selection. The subsequent weaknesses of CWE-330 and CWE-1204 are included to provide a more complete picture of the vulnerability, detailing the implications of the missing step.

The graph relationships influenced the selection by illustrating the hierarchical structure of the weaknesses. While CWE-330 is a broader class, CWE-1204 provides more specific details about the weak IV.
CWE-304 is the most specific and accurately describes the root cause, making it the most appropriate selection. The selection of CWE-304 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **missing step** in the authentication process as stated in the vulnerability description.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs authentication based on the name of a resource being accessed, or the name of the actor performing the access, but it does not properly check all possible names for that resource or actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-304: Missing Critical Step in Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements an authentication technique, but it skips a step that weakens the technique.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base
