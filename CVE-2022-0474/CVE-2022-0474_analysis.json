CWE-201 is a child of CWE-200, making it a more specific representation of the vulnerability. The decision favored the more specific Base level CWE-201 over the more general Class level CWE-200 due to the nature of the vulnerability being focused on data being sent.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  The OTRS application **fails to properly handle individual recipient settings** when sending notification emails.\n2.  This **failure** leads to the inclusion of a full list of recipients in the notification emails.\n3.  As a result, sensitive information (the list of recipients) is **inserted into sent data** (CWE-201).\n4.  This results in the **exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor** (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-201 as the primary candidate based on the vulnerability description and the retriever results. The **root cause of the vulnerability** is the **improper handling of individual recipient settings**, which leads to the **insertion of sensitive information into sent data**. This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-201, which focuses on the inclusion of sensitive information in data transmitted to another actor.\n\nThe relationship graph also influenced the final selection, reinforcing the choice of CWE-201 as a more specific child of CWE-200. While CWE-200 is a broader category, CWE-201 more accurately captures the specific mechanism of the vulnerability.\n\nThe assessment is primarily based on the provided evidence, specifically:\n\n*   \"The vulnerability lies in the OTRSCustomContactFields module where notification emails were not properly handling individual recipient settings, leading to the disclosure of the full list of recipients.\"\n*   \"Specifically, a vulnerability where the email addresses of all recipients in a contact field could be disclosed in notification emails, even when the notification was configured to send to each recipient individually.\"\n\nThese excerpts directly support the selection of CWE-201, as they indicate the direct insertion of sensitive information (email addresses) into sent data (notification emails).\n\nThe selected CWE, CWE-201, is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the weakness of inserting sensitive information into sent data. It is a base-level CWE, which is generally preferred for mapping to root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is not related to CRLF injection or HTTP request/response splitting.*\n\n## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is not related to CRLF injection.*\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is not related to injection of special elements.*\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is not related to files or directories.*\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE is related, but not as precise as CWE-201.
