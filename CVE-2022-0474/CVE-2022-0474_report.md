## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.5 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship considered was the parent-child relationship between CWE-200 and CWE-201. CWE-201 is a child of CWE-200, making it a more specific representation of the vulnerability. The decision favored the more specific Base level CWE-201 over the more general Class level CWE-200 due to the nature of the vulnerability being focused on data being sent.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events is as follows:
1.  The OTRS application **fails to properly handle individual recipient settings** when sending notification emails.
2.  This **failure** leads to the inclusion of a full list of recipients in the notification emails.
3.  As a result, sensitive information (the list of recipients) is **inserted into sent data** (CWE-201).
4.  This results in the **exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor** (CWE-200).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified CWE-201 as the primary candidate based on the vulnerability description and the retriever results. The **root cause of the vulnerability** is the **improper handling of individual recipient settings**, which leads to the **insertion of sensitive information into sent data**. This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-201, which focuses on the inclusion of sensitive information in data transmitted to another actor.

The relationship graph also influenced the final selection, reinforcing the choice of CWE-201 as a more specific child of CWE-200. While CWE-200 is a broader category, CWE-201 more accurately captures the specific mechanism of the vulnerability.

The assessment is primarily based on the provided evidence, specifically:

*   "The vulnerability lies in the OTRSCustomContactFields module where notification emails were not properly handling individual recipient settings, leading to the disclosure of the full list of recipients."
*   "Specifically, a vulnerability where the email addresses of all recipients in a contact field could be disclosed in notification emails, even when the notification was configured to send to each recipient individually."

These excerpts directly support the selection of CWE-201, as they indicate the direct insertion of sensitive information (email addresses) into sent data (notification emails).

The selected CWE, CWE-201, is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the weakness of inserting sensitive information into sent data. It is a base-level CWE, which is generally preferred for mapping to root causes of vulnerabilities.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is not related to CRLF injection or HTTP request/response splitting.*

## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is not related to CRLF injection.*

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

*This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is not related to injection of special elements.*

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is not related to files or directories.*

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE is related, but not as precise as CWE-201. CWE-201 focuses on the "insertion" into sent data, which better describes the case.*

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is not related to resource reuse.*

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is not related to path equivalence.*

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is not related to input validation.*

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.7
