CWE-1240 is a more specific instance of CWE-327, but it requires more specific evidence about the cryptographic primitive implementation being risky. Both CWEs are related to the use of cryptography, but at different levels of abstraction. CWE-327 is a class-level CWE, whereas CWE-1240 is a base-level CWE. The evidence supports the use of a risky cryptographic algorithm; however, it is not clear that it is a risky *implementation* which would require more evidence, and hence the slightly lower confidence.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe1240[\"CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\"]\n    \n    cwe1240 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe327 primary\n    class cwe1240 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of the **use of weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms** (CWE-327) leading to the ability of an attacker to decrypt highly sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed to CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) as the primary candidate, supported by the vulnerability description's key phrase \"**weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms**.\" The retriever results also listed CWE-327 as the top match.
