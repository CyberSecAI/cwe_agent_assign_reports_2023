While CWE-200 is broader, CWE-201 more accurately captures the specific vulnerability where sensitive information (hashed password and session ID) is being inserted into data sent in the customer detail view. The relationship between CWE-201 and CWE-200 influenced the selection, choosing the more specific base-level CWE over the class-level CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** Implicit inclusion of sensitive data (hashed password, session ID) in customer detail view requests.\n2.  **Weakness:** CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data.\n3.  **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data to unauthorized actors.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-201 as the primary candidate due to the **insertion of sensitive data** into the customer detail view request. This aligns well with the CWE's description: \"The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also mentions \"**sensitive data exposure**\" as a weakness.\n\nCWE-200 was considered but deemed less specific. While the vulnerability does lead to exposure, the root cause is the **improper inclusion of sensitive information into sent data**, making CWE-201 a more accurate fit. The official MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-200 discourages its use when more specific options are available.\n\nThe final decision to prioritize CWE-201 is based on its closer alignment with the root cause and the MITRE mapping guidance favoring more specific CWEs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
