The **weakness** is the **regular expression denial of service** due to **insecure usage of regular expressions**. The CVE reference links confirm this by stating, \"The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of regular expressions within the `terser` library,\".\n\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity). This selection is based on the fact that the vulnerability's **root cause** is the use of a regular expression with inefficient complexity, leading to excessive CPU consumption. The description states, \"The core issue is the potential for catastrophic backtracking in the regular expression engine when processing specific patterns.\" This aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-1333.\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) was considered as a secondary CWE since the ReDoS leads to excessive CPU consumption. While ReDoS is a type of resource consumption, the **root cause** is the inefficient regular expression and CWE-1333 is a more precise classification.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1333 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base). It directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the inefficient regular expression. While CWE-400 is also relevant as a consequence of the vulnerability, CWE-1333 provides a more precise and actionable classification for the **root cause**.\n### Relevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 1.00\n**Source**: alternate_terms\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: N/A\n**Source**: N/A\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the consumption of resources, which leads to a resource exhaustion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate.\n\nThe other CWEs in the Retriever Results, such as CWE-617 (Reachable Assertion), CWE-777 (Regular Expression without Anchors), and CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)), were not selected as they did not directly address the **root cause** of the vulnerability.
