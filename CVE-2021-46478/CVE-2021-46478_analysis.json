CWE-122, Heap-based Buffer Overflow, is a variant of CWE-787 and a child of CWE-119 as well. While the description explicitly mentions a \"heap buffer overflow\", the root cause is the **out-of-bounds write** that leads to it. Therefore, CWE-787 is a more precise base level classification, while CWE-122 is a more specific variant of buffer overflow. CWE-119 is a more general class, and its usage is discouraged, as the other CWEs are more specific to the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe122,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **heap buffer overflow** in `jsiClearStack`, which leads to memory corruption and ultimately a Denial of Service (DoS). The crafted JavaScript code triggers the overflow, indicating a potential lack of input validation or boundary checks.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Heap buffer overflow** (CWE-787) due to **improper** memory management.\n  - **Weakness:** Memory corruption.\n  - **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **heap buffer overflow** reported in the vulnerability description. The primary CWE match from similar CVE descriptions was CWE-416 (Use After Free). However, the CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions a **heap-buffer-overflow** in the `jsiClearStack` function, indicating an out-of-bounds write.\n\nThe evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states: \"A **heap-buffer-overflow** vulnerability exists in the `jsiClearStack` function within the `src/jsiEval.c` file of the jsish project.\" It also notes: \"The vulnerability is a **heap-buffer-overflow**, which occurs when the program attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer on the heap.\"\n\nConsidering the provided evidence and the CWE specifications, CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is the most appropriate primary CWE. It accurately reflects the root cause of the vulnerability, which is writing data beyond the allocated buffer. CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is included as a secondary CWE, as it describes the specific type of buffer overflow. CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is also considered, but it is a more general class and less specific than CWE-787 and is discouraged.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-787 being the base level and CWE-122 being a variant.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n\nNot selected.
