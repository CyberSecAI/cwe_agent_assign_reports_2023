CWE-613 can precede CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) because insufficient session expiration can lead to authentication vulnerabilities. CWE-384 (Session Fixation) is a compound weakness that requires multiple conditions to occur simultaneously.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe613[\"CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource after Expiry\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe384[\"CWE-384: Session Fixation\"]\n\n    cwe613 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe613 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe287\n    cwe384 -->|CHILDOF| cwe610\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe613 primary\n    class cwe384,cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insecure session management**, specifically **insufficient session expiration** (CWE-613). This leads to a situation where an unauthenticated attacker can gain access to user accounts, potentially leading to unauthorized viewing or modification of user data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **insecure session management** as the root cause, leading to the selection of CWE-613 (Insufficient Session Expiration) as the primary CWE. This selection is based on the vulnerability description stating \"Due to **insecure session management**, SAP Enable Now allows an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to users account.\"\n\nThe retriever results suggested other potential CWEs, including CWE-384 (Session Fixation) and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication). However, given the information provided, CWE-613 appears to be the most accurate representation of the root cause. CWE-384 may be a secondary factor if the application uses predictable session identifiers, and CWE-287 could be a consequence if the insufficient session expiration allows an attacker to bypass authentication checks.\n\nThe evidence provided focuses on the **insecure session management**, and the CWE-613 description matches this well: \"According to WASC, 'Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization.'\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-613 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **insecure session management** mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-99: Improper Control of Resource Identifiers ('Resource Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not restrict or incorrectly restricts the input before it is used as an identifier for a resource that may be outside the intended sphere of control.\nNOT USED: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability is not related to resource injection.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\nNOT USED: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability is not related to injection.\n\n## CWE-470: Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input with reflection to select which classes or code to use, but it does not sufficiently prevent the input from selecting improper classes or code.\nNOT USED: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability is not related to unsafe reflection.\n\n## CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component that specifies multiple attributes, properties, or fields that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control which attributes can be modified.\nNOT USED: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability is not related to modification of dynamically-determined object attributes.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\nNOT USED: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability is not related to reliance on untrusted inputs in a security decision.\n\n## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.\nNOT USED: This CWE is too general and does not accurately describe the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
