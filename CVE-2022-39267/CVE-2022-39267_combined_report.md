# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-287 | Improper Authentication | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Discouraged |
| CWE-1390 | Weak Authentication | 0.8 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.6 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-287, which is a Class-level CWE. CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) is a child of CWE-287, providing a more specific classification. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a peer, representing a closely related but distinct weakness. While CWE-1390 is more specific than CWE-287, the evidence points more strongly to a general failure to properly authenticate, rather than a specific weakness in the authentication mechanism itself. Thus, CWE-287 is preferred, though its usage is discouraged.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper authentication** mechanism in Bifrost. The application **weakly** relies on the presence of the `X-Requested-With` header for authentication checks. The absence of this header leads to an **authentication bypass**, ultimately granting unauthorized access to admin and monitor functionalities.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified **authentication bypass** as the core issue. The vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly indicate that the application **fails to properly authenticate** requests lacking the `X-Requested-With` header.

The retriever results suggested CWE-287 (**Improper Authentication**) as the top candidate, along with CWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**) and CWE-1390 (**Weak Authentication**).

The graph relationships highlight that CWE-1390 is a child of CWE-287, making it a more specific classification. However, the vulnerability's root cause is the **lack of robust authentication**, rather than a specific weakness in an existing authentication mechanism. The application simply skips authentication if the header is missing.

Therefore, CWE-287 is selected as the primary CWE, despite the discouraged usage, because it accurately reflects the fundamental problem: **the application does not properly authenticate** requests.

The evidence supporting this decision is:

*   Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: "**weakness: authentication bypass**"
*   CVE Reference Links Content Summary: "The application uses the presence of the `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` header to determine if a request should be subject to authentication checks. By removing this header, an attacker can bypass the authentication."

CWE-1390 is a secondary candidate because the authentication *is* weak, relying on a easily-spoofed header, but the primary issue is the complete bypass. CWE-863 is also a secondary candidate as the application ultimately authorizes the request, however, first it improperly authenticates it.

Other CWEs Considered:

*   CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data), CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)), CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input), CWE-204 (Observable Response Discrepancy), CWE-613 (Insufficient Session Expiration), CWE-93 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')), and CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity) were considered but deemed less relevant as they did not directly address the core issue of **authentication bypass**.

Ultimately, the selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, capturing both the fundamental flaw (**improper authentication**) and the resulting vulnerability (**authentication bypass**).

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-39267

## Vulnerability Description
Bifrost is a heterogeneous middleware that synchronizes MySQL, MariaDB to Redis, MongoDB, ClickHouse, MySQL and other services for production environments. Versions prior to 1.8.8-release are subject to **authentication bypass** in the admin and monitor user groups by deleting the X-Requested-With XMLHttpRequest field in the request header. This issue has been patched in 1.8.8-release. There are no known workarounds.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **authentication bypass**
- **vector:** deleting the X-Requested-With XMLHttpRequest field in the request header
- **attacker:** admin and monitor user groups
- **product:** Bifrost
- **version:** prior to 1.8.8-release

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application uses the presence of the `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` header to determine if a request should be subject to authentication checks. By removing this header, an attacker can bypass the authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authentication bypass due to reliance on a client-controlled header for security decisions. The vulnerability is that the authentication mechanism is not robust and depends on the presence of the `X-Requested-With` header, which is easily manipulated by an attacker.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthenticated users can access admin and monitor user groups' functionalities.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a crafted request without the `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` header, an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific position or prior access is required, meaning a remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).




## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-285
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-200
CanAlsoBe -> CWE-209
CanAlsoBe -> CWE-202

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Sensitive information could include data that is sensitive in and of itself (such as credentials or private messages), or otherwise useful in the further exploitation of the system (such as internal file system structure).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses




## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
XSPA: Cross Site Port Attack
SSRF: Server-Side Request Forgery

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-441
ChildOf -> CWE-610

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** CWE-918 (SSRF) and CWE-611 (XXE) are closely related, because they both involve web-related technologies and can launch outbound requests to unexpected destinations. However, XXE can be performed client-side, or in other contexts in which the software is not acting directly as a server, so the "Server" portion of the SSRF acronym does not necessarily apply.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-32786:** Chain: LLM integration framework has prompt injection (CWE-1427) that allows an attacker to force the service to retrieve data from an arbitrary URL, essentially providing SSRF (CWE-918) and potentially injecting content into downstream tasks.
- **CVE-2021-26855:** Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in mail server, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-21973:** Server Side Request Forgery in cloud platform, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-20
ChildOf -> CWE-20
CanPrecede -> CWE-789

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2008-1440:** lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop
- **CVE-2008-2374:** lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read




## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.

### Extended Description
This issue frequently occurs during authentication, where a difference in failed-login messages could allow an attacker to determine if the username is valid or not. These exposures can be inadvertent (bug) or intentional (design).

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-203

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** can overlap errors related to escalated privileges



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-2094:** This, and others, use ".." attacks and monitor error responses, so there is overlap with directory traversal.
- **CVE-2001-1483:** Enumeration of valid usernames based on inconsistent responses
- **CVE-2001-1528:** Account number enumeration via inconsistent responses.




## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
According to WASC, "Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization."

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-672
ChildOf -> CWE-672
CanPrecede -> CWE-287

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.






## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

### Extended Description


Attackers may be able to bypass weak authentication faster and/or with less effort than expected.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-287

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).
- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
- **CVE-2021-3116:** Chain: Python-based HTTP Proxy server uses the wrong boolean operators (CWE-480) causing an incorrect comparison (CWE-697) that identifies an authN failure if all three conditions are met instead of only one, allowing bypass of the proxy authentication (CWE-1390)




## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-74
CanPrecede -> CWE-117

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-1771:** CRLF injection enables spam proxy (add mail headers) using email address or name.
- **CVE-2002-1783:** CRLF injection in API function arguments modify headers for outgoing requests.
- **CVE-2004-1513:** Spoofed entries in web server log file via carriage returns




## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.

### Extended Description
Some regular expression engines have a feature called "backtracking". If the token cannot match, the engine "backtracks" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.
 Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:


  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.

  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.

  - The input can be long enough.

 Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. 

### Alternative Terms
ReDoS: ReDoS is an abbreviation of "Regular expression Denial of Service".
Regular Expression Denial of Service: While this term is attack-focused, this is commonly used to describe the weakness.
Catastrophic backtracking: This term is used to describe the behavior of the regular expression as a negative technical impact.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-5243:** server allows ReDOS with crafted User-Agent strings, due to overlapping capture groups that cause excessive backtracking.
- **CVE-2021-21317:** npm package for user-agent parser prone to ReDoS due to overlapping capture groups
- **CVE-2019-16215:** Markdown parser uses inefficient regex when processing a message, allowing users to cause CPU consumption and delay preventing processing of other messages.
