CWE-416 is a variant, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The chains involving CWE-416 like `CanPrecede -> CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition)` helped to contextualize potential impacts.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource after Expiration\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n    \n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe416 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe120\n    cwe416 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe123\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe825,cwe672,cwe120,cwe123 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use after free** (**CWE-416**) condition in the Safe Browsing component of Google Chrome on Android. This can lead to **heap corruption**, potentially allowing a remote attacker to exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious HTML page.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is a **use after free** (**CWE-416**) in the Safe Browsing component of Google Chrome on Android. This allows a remote attacker to potentially exploit **heap corruption** via a crafted HTML page. The vulnerability description clearly indicates the **rootcause** as \"use after free,\" and the description of CVE-2022-0979 in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-416** is based on the following evidence:\n*   The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** includes \"**rootcause: use after free**\".\n*   The **Vulnerability Description** states \"**Use after free** in Safe Browsing\".\n*   The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** states \"**Root cause of vulnerability: Use-after-free** in Safe Browsing.\"\n\nThe CWEs considered but not selected include:\n*   CWE-366 (Race Condition within a Thread): Although race conditions can sometimes lead to use-after-free vulnerabilities, there is no explicit mention of a race condition in this vulnerability description.\n*   CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow): The vulnerability results in **heap corruption**, but the **rootcause** is **use after free**, not a buffer overflow.\n*   CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write): While **heap corruption** could involve out-of-bounds writes, the **rootcause** is specifically a **use after free** condition.\n*   CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition): This could be a consequence of the **use after free**, but is not the **rootcause**.\n*   CWE-415 (Double Free): Similar to the above, the **rootcause** is specifically a **use after free** condition.\n\nThe provided evidence strongly supports the selection of **CWE-416** as the primary CWE. It is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is preferred, and it directly reflects the stated **rootcause** of the vulnerability.",
