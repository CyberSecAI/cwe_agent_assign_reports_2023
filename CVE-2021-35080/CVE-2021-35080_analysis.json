It is related to CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass) and CWE-420 (Unprotected Critical Parameters), suggesting potential avenues for exploitation. CWE-200 is considered as a secondary candidate, reflecting the information disclosure impact of the vulnerability. It is a Class level weakness that is often misused, hence its lower confidence.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1299[\"CWE-1299: Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface\"]\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Channel\"]\n    cwe420[\"CWE-420: Unprotected Critical Parameters\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe1299 -->|CHILDOF| cwe288\n    cwe1299 -->|CHILDOF| cwe420\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1299 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing protection mechanism** (CWE-1299) for the System Memory Management Unit (SMMU) when the RPM is assigned a secure stream. This **SMMU bypass** allows unauthorized access, leading to **information disclosure** (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description which clearly indicates a **missing SMMU protection mechanism** and a resulting **information disclosure** impact. The key phrase \"SMMU bypass\" directly supports the selection of a CWE related to missing or inadequate protection mechanisms. While the description mentions information disclosure, it is a consequence of the **SMMU bypass** rather than the root cause itself. Therefore, CWE-1299 is selected as the primary CWE due to its direct relevance to the root cause, and CWE-200 is considered as a secondary candidate because it represents the resulting impact.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-1299 is related to authentication bypass and unprotected parameters, which further strengthens its appropriateness for this vulnerability. The abstraction level of Base for CWE-1299 is also preferred for root cause analysis.\n\nCWE-200 was considered because the vulnerability description mentions information disclosure. However, CWE-200 is often misused and represents the impact rather than the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially
