CWE-327 is a `Class` level CWE. The relationships indicate that CWE-916 is more specific than CWE-327.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n    \n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe328\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe916 primary\n    class cwe327,cwe328 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a weak encryption algorithm** for storage and transmission of sensitive data, specifically password hashes, leading to an increased risk of an attacker obtaining system credentials.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **weak encryption algorithm** as the root cause of the vulnerability, making it easier for attackers to obtain credentials.\n\nThe vulnerability description states that the affected products utilize a **weak encryption algorithm** for storage and transmission of sensitive data, which may allow an attacker to more easily obtain credentials used for access. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause is the **use of a weak encryption algorithm** for storing and transmitting sensitive data, specifically password hashes. It also highlights CWE-916, \"Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort,\" as the primary weakness.\n\nThe retriever results also suggests CWE-916 as the top candidate. The CWE specification for CWE-916 describes a scenario where the product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive. This description aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description, making CWE-916 the most appropriate choice.\n\nCWE-327 \"Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\" was considered as a secondary option because the vulnerability description mentioned a **weak encryption algorithm**. However, CWE-916 is a more specific and accurate representation of the weakness since it directly relates to the **use of password hashes with insufficient computational effort**.\n\nTherefore, the final selection is CWE-916 as the primary CWE, with CWE-327 considered as a secondary, broader classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
