The description mentions a \"logic error\" that leads to this out-of-bounds write, suggesting an error in calculation or logic that determines where to write. This calculation error would be CWE-682, which is a class-level CWE. CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), indicating a more general class of memory safety issues. There is also a CANPRECEDE relationship between CWE-682 and CWE-787.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe682[\"CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe682 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe682 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **logic error** (potentially leading to CWE-682), resulting in an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787), and ultimately leading to local escalation of privilege.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) because the vulnerability description explicitly states \"**out of bounds write** due to a **logic error** in the code.\" The evidence is strong. The description also indicates a \"**logic error**\", suggesting that the out-of-bounds write is a consequence of some form of incorrect calculation or logic. The CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation) could be the cause of the out-of-bounds write.\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the nature of the memory corruption vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1419: Incorrect Initialization of Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to initialize a resource but does not correctly do so, which might leave the resource in an unexpected, incorrect, or insecure state when it is accessed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This CWE was not selected because the description does not point to issues with resource initialization.*\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
