# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2022-22107

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 1.0 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 0.7 | Pillar | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-862 [Missing Authorization], is a child of CWE-285 [Improper Authorization] and CWE-284 [Improper Access Control]. CWE-284 is a high-level Pillar, and the mapping guidance discourages its use in favor of more specific descendants. CWE-862, being a Class-level CWE, is more specific but still general. However, given the available information, it best describes the **missing authorization** issue. There isn't enough information to determine a more specific Base or Variant CWE.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Root Cause:** **Missing Authorization** (CWE-862)
**Impact:** Low-privileged users can view appointments of all users, including administrators.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified that the vulnerability description explicitly states "**Missing Authorization**" as the root cause. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating, "Missing authorization check for calendar view." The attack involves a low-privileged user accessing the calendar view without proper authorization.

The Retriever Results listed CWE-284 [Improper Access Control], CWE-639 [Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key], and CWE-862 [Missing Authorization] as potential candidates.

CWE-284 [Improper Access Control] is a Pillar-level CWE and is too general, as the mapping guidance suggests using more specific descendants. Therefore, it was considered but ultimately deemed less suitable as the primary CWE. However, it can be considered as a secondary CWE because it is a parent of CWE-862.

CWE-639 [Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key] involves modifying a key value to access another user's data. While the vulnerability description mentions that an attacker with a low-privileged account can access the calendar by directly manipulating the URL, appending `/appointments/calendar`, there is not enough information to determine if a key is being modified.

CWE-862 [Missing Authorization] directly aligns with the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. It is the most accurate representation of the **root cause** weakness.

Therefore, CWE-862 [Missing Authorization] is selected as the primary CWE with high confidence (1.0), and CWE-284 is selected as the secondary CWE with a confidence score of 0.7. This assessment is based on the explicit evidence in the vulnerability description and supporting information in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs authentication based on the name of a resource being accessed, or the name of the actor performing the access, but it does not properly check all possible names for that resource or actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-424: Improper Protection of Alternate Path
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently protect all possible paths that a user can take to access restricted functionality or resources.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-1299: Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The lack of protections on alternate paths to access
                control-protected assets (such as unprotected shadow registers
                and other external facing unguarded interfaces) allows an
                attacker to bypass existing protections to the asset that are
		only performed against the primary path.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
