The product uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms. |\n| CWE-1240 | Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. The vulnerability description indicates the use of a potentially risky cryptographic implementation, but it does not provide specific details. |\n| CWE-326 | Inadequate Encryption Strength | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate.

CWE-1240, a Base-level weakness, is a child of CWE-327 and describes the use of a cryptographic primitive with a risky implementation. CWE-326, a Class, describes inadequate encryption strength and is related to CWE-327.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe1240[\"CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\"]\n    cwe326[\"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n\n    cwe327 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe1240 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    cwe326 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe327 primary\n    class cwe1240,cwe326 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of weak cryptographic algorithms** (CWE-327). This leads to the potential for an attacker to **decrypt highly sensitive information**, which is the impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-327 as the primary weakness due to the **root cause** being **\"weak cryptographic algorithms\"**. The retriever results also listed CWE-327 as the top candidate.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states the use of \"weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms,\" which directly aligns with CWE-327's description: \"The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.\" The impact, as stated, is that an attacker could \"decrypt highly sensitive information.\"\n\nCWE-1240 was considered because it is a more specific Base-level CWE related to the use of cryptographic primitives with risky implementations. However, without more details about the specific cryptographic primitives used, CWE-327 is a more appropriate fit.\n\nCWE-326 was also considered, as \"Inadequate Encryption Strength\" is closely related to using weak or risky cryptographic algorithms. However, CWE-327 is a more direct match for the vulnerability description.\n\nThe final decision is primarily based on the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**, particularly the **root cause** of **\"weak cryptographic algorithms\"** and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary that indicates the use of weak cryptography.\n\nThe selection of CWE-327 is at the optimal level of specificity because the description focuses on the algorithm itself being weak or risky. While further analysis could potentially identify a more specific weakness related to the implementation (CWE-1240) or strength (CWE-326) of the encryption, the available evidence does not support such a determination.",
