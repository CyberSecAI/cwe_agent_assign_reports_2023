# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2022-23501

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1390 | Weak Authentication | 0.8 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE |
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-1390 **Weak Authentication**, is a child of CWE-287 **Improper Authentication**, indicating a hierarchical relationship where CWE-1390 is a more specific type of authentication failure. CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** is a peer that represents a distinct but related flaw in access control. Selecting CWE-1390 provides a more targeted classification due to the specific nature of the authentication **weakness**, while acknowledging the potential overlap with authorization concerns.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of **weaknesses** begins with **Improper Authentication**, where the system fails to adequately verify a user's identity. This leads to a bypass of intended access restrictions, allowing a potential attacker to access a different account if the attacker knows the credentials.

## Summary of Analysis
Initial analysis identified **Improper Authentication** as the root cause, as stated in the vulnerability description: "TYPO3 is vulnerable to **Improper Authentication**." However, considering the retriever results and the CWE specifications, a more specific classification is needed.

The retriever results suggest CWE-1390 **Weak Authentication** and CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** as top candidates. The CVE reference link content summary also mentions "Weak authentication (CWE-287 **Improper Authentication**)" and "Improper Authorization (CWE-302)" as present **weaknesses**.

CWE-1390 **Weak Authentication** is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability involves a **weakness** in the authentication mechanism, specifically related to the way TYPO3 handles frontend login for users organized in different storage folders. The description states: "Restricting frontend login to specific users, organized in different storage folders (partitions), can be bypassed," which indicates a flaw in how user identities are verified. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-1390 suggests examining child entries for a better fit, but no child entry is more appropriate.

CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** is a secondary candidate because the vulnerability also involves a bypass of access restrictions. The description states: "A potential attacker might use this ambiguity in usernames to get access to a different account," which suggests that the authorization mechanism is not correctly enforcing access controls.

The evidence supports the selection of CWE-1390 **Weak Authentication** as the primary CWE, with CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** as a secondary candidate. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, providing a clear and accurate classification of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].

## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of
