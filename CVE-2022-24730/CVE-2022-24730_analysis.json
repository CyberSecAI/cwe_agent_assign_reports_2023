This is compounded by an improper access control issue (CWE-284), which permits users with read-only access to exploit the path traversal. The combination allows attackers to bypass intended restrictions and leak sensitive information. CWE-22 is a base level CWE and is parent of CWE-23 (Relative Path Traversal). CWE-284 is also a base level CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe23[\"CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\"]\n    \n    cwe23 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    cwe22 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n    class cwe23 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **path traversal bug** (CWE-22) which, when combined with an **improper access control bug** (CWE-284), leads to the **leak of sensitive files**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified two key weaknesses: a **path traversal bug** and an **improper access control bug**. The vulnerability description states: \"Argo CD starting with version 1.3.0 but before versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0 is vulnerable to a **path traversal bug**, compounded by an **improper access control bug**, allowing a malicious user with read-only repository access to leak sensitive files from Argo CDs repo-server.\" This clearly points to both CWE-22 and CWE-284. The combination of these weaknesses allows for unauthorized access to sensitive files.\n\nCWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory) is the primary root cause because the software fails to properly neutralize special elements within pathnames, allowing the attacker to access files outside the intended directory. The description mentions that a malicious user can craft an API request to leak the contents of out-of-bounds files, directly indicating path traversal.\n\nCWE-284 (Improper Access Control) is a secondary weakness, as the vulnerability can only be exploited because the access controls are insufficient. The description states that a malicious user with read-only repository access can exploit the path traversal, indicating that access controls are not properly preventing unauthorized access.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they accurately represent the root causes of the vulnerability. More general CWEs would not capture the specific nature of the weaknesses.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
