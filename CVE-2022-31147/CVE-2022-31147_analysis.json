CWE-1333 is a child of CWE-407 (Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity), indicating a more general class of algorithmic efficiency issues. CWE-20 is a high-level class that is often misused.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    cwe1333 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe407 secondary\n    class cwe20 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the use of an inefficient regular expression (CWE-1333) which leads to excessive CPU consumption and ultimately a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-1333 as the primary candidate due to the presence of a **regular expression denial of service** (**ReDoS**) vulnerability, which stems from an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-43306 in the `url2` method of the `jquery-validation` npm package. The evidence supports this selection because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions ReDoS and the CVE reference links content summary confirms that the root cause is an inefficient regular expression used for URL validation.\n\nThe vulnerability description key phrases also identify the **weakness** as **regular expression denial of service**.\n\nThe retriever results also listed CWE-1333 as the top candidate with a score of 1.0.\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) was considered because the vulnerability involves validating URLs, but it's a high-level class and less specific than CWE-1333. The MITRE mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-20 when lower-level CWEs are available.\n\nThe decision to use CWE-1333 is based on its direct relevance to the **ReDoS** vulnerability and its base-level abstraction, which aligns with the mapping guidance.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
