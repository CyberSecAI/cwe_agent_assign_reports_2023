CWE-1240, \"Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation,\" is a child of CWE-327 and a Base-level CWE and was considered as a more specific alternative. However, the description of the vulnerability did not provide enough detail to definitively determine if the issue was with the implementation of a cryptographic primitive rather than the algorithm itself, so CWE-327 was chosen as the primary CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe1240[\"CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\"]\n    \n    cwe1240 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe327 primary\n    class cwe1240 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of the **use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm** (CWE-327), which leads to the exposure of sensitive information.\n  - Root Cause: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\n  - Impact: Exposure of Sensitive Information\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The key phrase \"**broken or risky cryptographic algorithm**\" in the vulnerability description and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" directly pointed to issues related to cryptography. Both the retriever results and the vulnerability description support CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm as a strong candidate.\n\nThe vulnerability description states, \"The use of a **broken or risky cryptographic algorithm** is an unnecessary risk that may result in the exposure of sensitive information.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" further validates this, stating, \"The vulnerability stems from the use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm\" and \"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm: The system employs a flawed cryptographic algorithm, increasing the risk of exposing sensitive information during communication.\"\n\nCWE-327 is a Class-level CWE, and the guidance suggests examining child CWEs for a better fit. CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation, which is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-327, was considered. However, the provided information did not specify whether the issue was with the algorithm itself or its specific implementation. Therefore, CWE-327 was chosen as the primary CWE because it more accurately represents the available information.\n\nCWE-1240 is included as a secondary candidate.\n\nThe retriever results listed several other CWEs, including CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash, CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort, and CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy. However, these were not chosen because the vulnerability description and CVE summary clearly indicate a problem with the cryptographic algorithm itself, not specifically with hashing or timing discrepancies.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.\n\n### Extended Description\nCryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors.
