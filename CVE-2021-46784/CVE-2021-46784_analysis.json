CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400, making it a more specific case of uncontrolled resource consumption. The choice of CWE-770 is also supported by the description referring to **improper buffer management** during the processing of long Gopher server responses, suggesting that resources (buffers) are being allocated without appropriate limits.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper buffer management** and leads to excessive resource allocation, ultimately causing a Denial of Service (DoS). The root cause is the lack of limits or throttling on resource allocation, and the impact is the exhaustion of resources leading to service disruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nMy analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions **improper buffer management** as the root cause of the Denial of Service. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also supports this by stating \"Improper buffer management when processing Gopher server responses\".\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is a more specific type of CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption), which aligns well with the vulnerability's root cause.\n\nThe selection of CWE-770 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **improper allocation of resources** without limits, which is the core issue described in the vulnerability. While CWE-400 is a broader category, CWE-770 provides a more precise classification of the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as
