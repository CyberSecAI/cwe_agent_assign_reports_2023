This is a variant of the more general weakness, Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798). The password is \"hard-coded\" in the sense that it's derived from static device information and a known algorithm. Although a hash is involved, the hashing scheme lacks sufficient computational effort, leading to CWE-916.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    \n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe916 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe259\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe259 primary\n    class cwe798,cwe916 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** of using a predictable method to generate the password for the engineering account. The password is created by combining the serial number and model of the device, and then hashing that value with SHA256. The hash is then truncated, meaning the computational effort is weak. This leads to the **impact** of unauthorized access to the CPE admin website. The chain is: Predictable Password Generation -> **CWE-259** -> **CWE-916** -> Unauthorized Access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified several potential CWEs related to the use of weak credentials and hard-coded values. After careful review, the most specific and accurate classification is CWE-259, Use of Hard-coded Password, because the vulnerability description and CVE details clearly state that the password for the 'verizon' account is derived in a predictable manner from the device's serial number and model. This predictable derivation makes it effectively a **hard-coded** password, even though it's not literally stored in the firmware.\n\nThe supporting evidence for this decision is found in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\":\n\"The vulnerability arises from the pre-generation of a static password for the 'verizon' engineering account in both the IDU (InDoor Unit) and ODU (OutDoor Unit) of the Verizon 5G LVSKIHP modem/router.\"\n\"The static password is derived from a predictable combination of the device's serial number and model number via a SHA256 hash.\"\n\nCWE-916, Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort, is a secondary consideration. The password uses a SHA256 hash which is then truncated. This truncation weakens the computational effort needed to crack the password.\n\nCWE-798, Use of Hard-coded Credentials, is also a secondary consideration, since CWE-259 is a variant of CWE-798 and is therefore more specific.\n\nCWE-1391, Use of Weak Credentials, was considered but deemed too general. While the derived password can be considered weak, the weakness stems from the specific **hard-coded** nature and insufficient computational effort, which are better captured by CWE-259 and CWE-916. The mapping guidance for CWE-1391 suggests examining its children for a better fit, which led to the selection of CWE-259.\n\nCWE-291, Reliance on IP Address for Authentication, was deemed irrelevant as the authentication **weakness** doesn't rely on IP addresses but rather on a predictable password.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
