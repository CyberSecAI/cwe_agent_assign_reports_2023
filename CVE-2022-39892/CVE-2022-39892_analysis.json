CWE-285 and CWE-863 are both children of CWE-284. While CWE-284 is very general (Pillar), CWE-285 and CWE-863 are more specific (Class). Since there is evidence supporting that the **improper access control** is caused by **incorrect authorization**, CWE-863 is also chosen.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of root cause and weaknesses is as follows:\n1.  Root Cause: **Improper access control** due to missing or incorrect authorization checks.\n2.  Impact: Attackers gain unauthenticated access.\n3.  Vector: Exploitation of the \"keep open\" feature.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the root cause: **improper access control** in Samsung Pass. The CVE description and key phrases point to authorization issues, with attackers gaining unauthenticated access.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision comes from the vulnerability description: \"**Improper access control** in Samsung Pass prior to version 4.0.05.1 allows attackers to unauthenticated access via keep open feature.\" and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which states: \"Root cause: **Improper access control** in Samsung Pass via the keep open feature.\" and \"Weaknesses: [**Improper access control**]\".\n\nThe retriever results also suggest CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) as potential candidates.\n\nCWE-284 is a Pillar and discouraged. CWE-285 is a Class and discouraged. CWE-863 is a Class and Allowed-with-Review.\n\nCWE-285 and CWE-863 were selected because they are more specific than CWE-284. CWE-863 was selected as a secondary CWE since the **improper access control** is more accurately described as **incorrect authorization**.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but not used:\n*   CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) - While unauthenticated access is mentioned, the root cause is not a failure in authentication, but rather in authorization after authentication.\n*   CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) - While the impact could lead to exposure of information, the root cause is access control, not direct information exposure.\n\nBased on the evidence, relationship analysis, and mapping guidance, the selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
