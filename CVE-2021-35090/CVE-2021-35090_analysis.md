# Analysis for CVE-2021-35090

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-367 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-367, is a child of CWE-362. This indicates a hierarchical relationship where CWE-367 is a more specific type of race condition. Since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions "TOCTOU race condition," mapping to the base CWE-367 is more accurate than the class CWE-362.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability involves a **TOCTOU race condition** leading to hypervisor memory corruption.
  - Root Cause: **TOCTOU race condition** (CWE-367)
  - Impact: hypervisor memory corruption

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**TOC TOU race condition**" as the root cause. The best match for this is CWE-367 "Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition." The description of CWE-367 states: "The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state." This aligns directly with the vulnerability description.

CWE-362 "Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')" is a broader class of race conditions. While relevant, it is less specific than CWE-367. The mapping guidance for CWE-362 suggests examining its children for a better fit, which further supports selecting CWE-367.

The choice of CWE-367 is made with high confidence because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **TOC TOU race condition**, making it a direct and specific match.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
If two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not lock or does not correctly lock a resource when the product must have exclusive access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product obtains a value from an untrusted source, converts this value to a pointer, and dereferences the resulting pointer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 7484.65
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition.
