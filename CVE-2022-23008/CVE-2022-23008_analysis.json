CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] is potentially a secondary weakness if the injected JavaScript code is directly related to manipulating the web page. CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization] could be considered if the **incorrect authorization** allows access to API endpoints which then can be exploited to inject JavaScript code. This relationship impacts the selection as CWE-94 is favored when the injected code alters the intended control flow of the product.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe94 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe79\n    cwe94 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe79,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of weaknesses starts with potentially **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863) which allows access to the API endpoint, followed by the **improper control of code generation** (CWE-94) where JavaScript code is injected. If this leads to a web page manipulation, this will result in **improper neutralization of input during web page generation** (CWE-79).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability and associated weaknesses. The core issue is the injection of JavaScript code, which points towards CWE-94 [Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')]. This is supported by the vulnerability description stating that an attacker can \"**inject JavaScript code** that is executed on managed NGINX data plane instances.\" The analysis considered CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] and CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization] as secondary CWEs due to the possibility of web page manipulation and **incorrect authorization** respectively.\n\nThe graph relationships helped refine the selection by visualizing the potential flow of the vulnerability. CWE-94 [Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')] remains the primary CWE due to its direct connection to the code injection.\n\nThe final decision prioritizes CWE-94 [Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')] as the most specific and relevant CWE based on the provided evidence. The selection is at the Base level, which is the optimal level of specificity. CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] and CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization] are considered as secondary issues that may arise from the injected code or that may allow the attacker to inject code through undisclosed API endpoints.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-99: Improper Control of Resource Identifiers ('Resource Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not restrict or incorrectly restricts the input before it is used as an identifier for a resource that may be outside the intended sphere

List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n##

abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component that specifies multiple attributes, properties, or fields that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control which attributes can be modified.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. However, classification research is limited for weaknesses of this type, so there can be gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE that force use of this weakness, even at",
