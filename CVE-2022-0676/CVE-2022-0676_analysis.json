CWE-131 **Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size** can **CanPrecede** CWE-787 if the size calculation leads to an undersized buffer allocation, causing an out-of-bounds write.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe131[\"CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\"]\n    cwe788[\"CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe788\n    cwe788 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe131 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe122,cwe131 secondary\n    class cwe119,cwe788 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **incorrect calculation of the buffer size** (CWE-131), leading to a **heap-based buffer overflow** (CWE-122), which results in an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is a **heap-based buffer overflow**, which is an instance of **Out-of-bounds Write**. The vulnerability description and reference links indicate that the root cause is an **incorrect size calculation** in the `read_cache_accel` function when parsing dyldcache files.\n\nThe evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary states:\n- \"**Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is the potential for writing data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.\"\n- \"The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `bin_dyldcache.c` file within the radare2 project, specifically within the dyldcache parser. This occurs due to an **incorrect calculation of the size** of data to be read while parsing the dyldcache.\"\n\nCWE-787 **Out-of-bounds Write** is the primary CWE because the core issue involves writing data beyond the intended buffer boundary. CWE-122 **Heap-based Buffer Overflow** is included as a secondary CWE to provide more context about the location of the buffer. CWE-131 **Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size** is included because the root cause of the overflow is an incorrect size calculation.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-787 being a **Base** CWE and CWE-122 being a **Variant** CWE. This provides a balance between accurately representing the vulnerability and providing enough detail about its specific nature.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
