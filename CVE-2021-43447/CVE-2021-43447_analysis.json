The retriever also suggested CWE-284 Improper Access Control, but this is a Pillar level CWE and is too high level. CWE-306 is a child of CWE-287 Improper Authentication, which is a child of CWE-284. Since we have enough information to select the Base level CWE-306, we will do so.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** on the WebSocket endpoint (CWE-306), which then leads to the impact of allowing attackers to edit documents without authentication and potentially leading to data exposure, session hijacking, and remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **Incorrect Access Control** as the root cause, leading to an **authentication bypass**. The retriever results and the CVE reference links content summary strongly support the selection of CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function, as the WebSocket endpoint lacks any authentication mechanism.\n\nThe CVE reference links content summary states:\n*   **Root Cause:** The ONLYOFFICE document editor's WebSocket endpoint did not require authentication, allowing unauthenticated connections.\n\nThe vulnerability description states:\n*   ONLYOFFICE all versions as of 2021-11-08 is affected by **Incorrect Access Control**. An **authentication bypass** in the document editor allows attackers to edit documents without authentication.\n\nThe selection of CWE-306 is based on the direct evidence of the **missing authentication** for the WebSocket endpoint and the resulting impact. The CWE is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) and is supported by the retriever results and the vulnerability details. Other CWEs like CWE-284 Improper Access Control are too general. CWE-305 Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness was considered, but the primary weakness is the **missing authentication** itself, making CWE-306 a more direct fit.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: There is no authentication algorithm used.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe

There is no authorization used.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: There is no protection mechanism.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is

0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant

0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: There are no assumed-immutable parameters.\n\n## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: There is no authentication.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: There are no credentials used.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: The document does not reference validation.\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does

check.\n\n## CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 5971.00\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: This is not an XML issue.\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 5925.20\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n**Rationale for not
