CWE-1295 is a peer of CWE-209 and child of CWE-200, indicating that both CWE-532 and CWE-1295 involve the exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200). CWE-201 can precede CWE-226 and CWE-212. The base level abstraction accurately represents the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe1295[\"CWE-1295: Debug Messages Revealing Unnecessary Information\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe538[\"CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe226[\"CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\"]\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe538\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe1295 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe1295 -->|PEEROF| cwe209\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe201 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe226\n    cwe201 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe212\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe1295,cwe201 secondary\n    class cwe538,cwe200,cwe209,cwe226,cwe212 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the logging of potentially sensitive information (PII) through `StatusBarNotification.getKey()` in the `CarNotificationListener.java` component of Android 12L.\n  - **Root Cause:** The **StatusBarNotification.getKey() could contain sensitive information**.\n  - **Weakness:** Failure to prevent the logging of this sensitive information in user builds.\n  - **Impact:** Exposure of users account names or other PII in logs.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-532 as the primary weakness due to the direct logging of sensitive information. This is supported by the vulnerability description: \"prints out the StatusBarNotification.getKey() directly in logs, which could contain users account name (i.e. PII), in Android user build.\" The retriever results also strongly support CWE-532. The relationship analysis confirmed that CWE-532 is a base-level weakness related to the exposure of sensitive information and insertion of sensitive information.\n\nCWE-1295 was considered as an additional weakness, as the logging occurs in debug messages. However, the description does not specifically mention debug builds. It states, \"in Android user build\", so the logging of PII is not limited to debugging scenarios.\nCWE-201 was considered because sensitive information is inserted into sent data. The log file represents the sent data.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-532 is based on the evidence that sensitive information is directly written to log files. The abstraction level is appropriate because it is a base-level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
