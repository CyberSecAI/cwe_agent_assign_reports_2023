While CWE-285 could be considered, CWE-862 is more specific and directly reflects the **missing permission check** described in the vulnerability. CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is related to CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) and CWE-549 (Missing Password Field Masking) as a parent. However, since the vulnerability describes the enumeration of credential IDs and not the exposure of the credentials themselves, CWE-522 is only a secondary consideration.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe549[\"CWE-549: Missing Password Field Masking\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe549 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe256,cwe549 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing permission check** (CWE-862), which allows attackers to enumerate credential IDs. The potential next step in the chain, as noted in the CVE description, is the use of these IDs to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) because the vulnerability description explicitly states a **missing permission check**. This aligns with the CWE's description: \"The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\" The impact is that attackers with Overall/Read permission can enumerate credential IDs. The evidence is strong, as the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section identifies the **\"missing permission check\"** as the root cause. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also confirms this by stating \"**Missing permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.**\"\n\nCWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) was considered because the vulnerability allows enumeration of credential IDs. However, the vulnerability doesn't directly expose the credentials themselves, but rather the IDs. Therefore, CWE-522 is a secondary concern.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the root cause **(missing permission check)**. The MITRE mapping guidance allows for CWE-862, but suggests examining children for a better fit, but there isn't a more specific child. The analysis relies heavily on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary, which both point to the **missing permission check**.",
