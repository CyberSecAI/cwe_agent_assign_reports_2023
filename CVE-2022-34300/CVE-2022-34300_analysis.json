CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is also considered because the buffer is allocated on the heap. The relationships show a clear path from the more general out-of-bounds read to the specific case of an over-read, and the heap allocation further refines the context.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe788[\"CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe125\n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe788\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe788\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe126 primary\n    class cwe125,cwe122 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with the **heap-based buffer over-read**, which is the root cause. This leads to reading beyond the allocated buffer on the heap, potentially causing information disclosure or a crash.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified a **heap-based buffer over-read** in tinyexr 1.0.1, specifically within the `tinyexrDecodePixelData` function. The ASan output confirms a heap-buffer-overflow, indicating a write beyond the allocated buffer.\n\nThe primary selection, CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read), is based on the evidence that the code reads past the end of the allocated buffer. This is supported by the vulnerability description stating a \"**heap-based buffer over-read**\" and the ASan output showing a read of size 1 beyond the allocated region. The evidence is sufficient to support this classification with high confidence.\n\nCWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is also considered due to the heap allocation aspect, but the core issue is the reading past the buffer, making CWE-126 more directly relevant.\n\nCWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is a broader category, and while applicable, CWE-126 is more specific to the \"over-read\" scenario, providing a more precise classification.\n\nThe final selection is at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-126 being a Variant that accurately describes the vulnerability's characteristics. This decision is supported by the MITRE mapping guidance, which allows for the use of Variant-level CWEs when they provide a better fit.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize a critical resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
