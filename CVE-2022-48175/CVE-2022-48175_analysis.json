CWE-89 is a prerequisite, where **SQL injection** is exploited to inject malicious code into the database.

This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code. The vulnerability description states, \"The vulnerability stems from the ability to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code by manipulating database entries... The `configuration` field of a `fieldtype_ajax_request` is designed to store configuration data but is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject PHP code for execution.\"\n\nCWE-89 is a secondary vulnerability because the attacker leverages an **SQL injection** vulnerability to insert the malicious code into the database. The description states, \"The attacker leverages an unspecified SQL injection vulnerability to insert a malicious entry into the `app_fields` table.\"\n\nCWE-95 is at the Variant level, which is the preferred level of abstraction. CWE-89 is at the Base level, which is also preferred.\n\nCWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')) was considered because the RCE could lead to the execution of arbitrary OS commands. However, the root cause is the **improper neutralization** of code directives, not OS command elements. Therefore, CWE-78 is not an appropriate mapping.\n\nCWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) was considered, but it involves the generation of web pages with unsanitized input, which is not the case here.",
