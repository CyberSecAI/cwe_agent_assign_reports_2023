|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-620 | Unverified Password Change | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the ChildOf relationship from CWE-620 to CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication). However, since CWE-620 is a Base-level CWE and directly describes the **lack of password change protection** without requiring the original password, it was chosen over the more general Class-level CWE-1390.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain consists of a **lack of password change protection**, leading to a remote attacker being able to change the password of a compromised session without knowing the existing user's password.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **lack of password change protection**. The description clearly states that a remote attacker can change the password of a compromised session without knowing the existing user's password.

The Retriever Results highlighted CWE-620 (Unverified Password Change) as the top candidate, which aligns directly with the vulnerability description. CWE-620 is a Base-level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The Complete CWE Specifications for CWE-620 explicitly state that it applies when "setting a new password for a user, the product does not require knowledge of the original password, or using another form of authentication." This matches the vulnerability description perfectly.

Other CWEs were considered but not chosen:

*   CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)): While CSRF could potentially be involved, the core weakness is the **lack of password change protection**, not the mechanism by which the request is made.
*   CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials): This CWE is about the insecure storage or transmission of credentials, which is not the case here. The problem is the **lack of a requirement for the existing password** during a password change.
*   CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication): This is a more general Class-level CWE, and CWE-620 is a more specific child that better describes the vulnerability.
*   CWE-285 (Improper Authorization): This CWE is about incorrect authorization checks, which is not the primary issue here. The main issue is the **lack of a check for the existing password**.
*   CWE-640 (Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password): This CWE is for a weak password recovery mechanism, but the vulnerability description is about changing a password, not recovering a forgotten one.

The decision to map to CWE-620 is based on the following evidence from the vulnerability description: "**lack of password change protection** vulnerability...allows a remote attacker to change the password of a compromised session without knowing the existing users password."

The final selection of CWE-620 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.

## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not implement sufficient measures to prevent multiple failed authentication attempts within a short time frame.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
