It is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), indicating a more general class of memory safety issues. No other relationships significantly influenced the selection, as the description clearly points to an out-of-bounds write scenario leading to **memory corruption**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward: the scripting engine contains a flaw that allows for an **out-of-bounds write**, leading to **memory corruption**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** which indicates \"**weakness:** **memory corruption**\" in the **Scripting Engine**. The **CWE for similar CVE Descriptions** section lists CWE-787 as the primary and top CWE. The Retriever Results also strongly support CWE-787 with a score of 1.000.\n\nThe relationship analysis confirms that CWE-787 is at the appropriate level of specificity (Base) and is a type of memory safety issue. The provided information is sufficient to confidently map this vulnerability to CWE-787. The \"Alternative Terms\" for CWE-787 mentions \"Memory Corruption\" which further confirms the selection.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nMemory Corruption: Often used to describe the consequences of writing to memory outside the bounds of a buffer, or to memory that is otherwise invalid.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-1017:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to write 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.\n- **CVE-2021-21220:** Chain: insufficient input validation (CWE-20) in browser allows heap corruption (CWE-787), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-28664:** GPU kernel driver allows memory corruption because a user can obtain read/write access to read-only pages, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n## Other Considered CWEs:\n\n*   CWE-416: Use After Free was considered but rejected because the description indicates a **memory corruption** issue, not a use-after-free.\n*   CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read was considered but rejected because the description indicates a **memory corruption** issue, which implies a write operation.\n*   CWE-415: Double Free was considered but rejected because there is no evidence of double freeing in the description.\n*   CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition was considered, but is less specific than CWE-787 which directly addresses out-of-bounds writes.",
