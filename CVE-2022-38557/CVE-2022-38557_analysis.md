# Analysis for CVE-2022-38557

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1392 | Use of Default Credentials | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-259 | Use of Hard-coded Password | 0.8 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-798 | Use of Hard-coded Credentials | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is that CWE-1392 **Use of Default Credentials** is a child of CWE-1391 **Use of Weak Credentials**. CWE-259 **Use of Hard-coded Password** is a variant of CWE-798 **Use of Hard-coded Credentials**. The base CWE-1392 is chosen because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the presence of static default credentials. While the credentials could technically be hard-coded, the description doesn't explicitly state that, making the broader "default credentials" more appropriate.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events is as follows:
1.  **Root Cause:** The device is configured with **static default credentials** (CWE-1392).
2.  **Weakness:** An attacker can use these credentials to gain unauthorized access.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which states that the D-Link DIR845L contains a **static default credential** vulnerability.

The vulnerability description states: "D-Link DIR845L v1.00-v1.03 contains a Static Default Credential vulnerability in /etc/init0.d/S80telnetd.sh."

The primary CWE is CWE-1392 **Use of Default Credentials**, because the vulnerability description key phrases contain the term "static default credential".

CWE-259 **Use of Hard-coded Password** and CWE-798 **Use of Hard-coded Credentials** were considered as the credentials could be technically hard-coded, but the description uses the broader term "default credentials" making CWE-1392 a better fit.

The selected CWE, CWE-1392, is at the optimal level of specificity, as it accurately reflects the vulnerability's root cause.
Relevant CWE Information:
# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:
## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
## CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product uses default credentials (such as passwords or cryptographic keys) for potentially critical functionality.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
To fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
## CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
