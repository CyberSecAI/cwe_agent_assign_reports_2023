CWE-259 **Use of Hard-coded Password** is a variant of CWE-798 **Use of Hard-coded Credentials**. The base CWE-1392 is chosen because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the presence of static default credentials. While the credentials could technically be hard-coded, the description doesn't explicitly state that, making the broader \"default credentials\" more appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1392[\"CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe1392 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1391\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1392 primary\n    class cwe259,cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** The device is configured with **static default credentials** (CWE-1392).\n2.  **Weakness:** An attacker can use these credentials to gain unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which states that the D-Link DIR845L contains a **static default credential** vulnerability.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"D-Link DIR845L v1.00-v1.03 contains a Static Default Credential vulnerability in /etc/init0.d/S80telnetd.sh.\"\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-1392 **Use of Default Credentials**, because the vulnerability description key phrases contain the term \"static default credential\".\n\nCWE-259 **Use of Hard-coded Password** and CWE-798 **Use of Hard-coded Credentials** were considered as the credentials could be technically hard-coded, but the description uses the broader term \"default credentials\" making CWE-1392 a better fit.\n\nThe selected CWE, CWE-1392, is at the optimal level of specificity, as it accurately reflects the vulnerability's root cause.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n## CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product uses default credentials (such as passwords or cryptographic keys) for potentially critical functionality.\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
