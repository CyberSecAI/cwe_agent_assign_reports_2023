It is a child of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials), indicating that it represents a more specific case of credential protection issues. The peer relationship to CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) suggests that while the password isn't hard-coded, the weakness lies in how it is stored, making it recoverable.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe257[\"CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    \n    cwe257 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe257 -->|PEEROF| cwe259\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe257 primary\n    class cwe522,cwe259 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** of storing user passwords encrypted in flash memory. This leads to the impact where an attacker with physical access can retrieve the file and decrypt the passwords, ultimately leading to unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is storing passwords in a recoverable format. The analysis is based on the provided evidence, particularly the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which states: \" **CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format:** The passwords, though encrypted, can be decrypted by an attacker with physical access to the device.\"\n\nThe graph relationships helped confirm that CWE-257 is the most appropriate base-level CWE, given its relation to more general credential protection issues (CWE-522) and other password-related weaknesses (CWE-259). The selection of CWE-257 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately describes the vulnerability where the encryption is insufficient to prevent password recovery by an attacker with physical access.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users.
