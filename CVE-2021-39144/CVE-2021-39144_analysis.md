# Analysis for CVE-2021-39144

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-502 | Deserialization of Untrusted Data | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability involves deserializing untrusted data leading to command execution. |
| CWE-915 | Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE: The vulnerability allows modification of object attributes during deserialization, which can lead to code execution. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-502, which directly addresses the deserialization of untrusted data. CWE-915 is a peer of CWE-502 and focuses on the modification of dynamically determined object attributes, providing a more specific view of the actions performed during the deserialization process. These relationships help to refine the understanding of the vulnerability by highlighting both the overall process (deserialization) and the specific actions that lead to the exploit (attribute modification).

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the deserialization of untrusted data (CWE-502). This process allows an attacker to inject or replace objects in the input stream. These injected objects can then be used to modify object attributes (CWE-915), ultimately leading to the execution of arbitrary commands on the host system.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis pointed strongly towards CWE-502 due to the description of deserializing untrusted data. The key phrases "**improper input sanitization**" and "**XML injection**" in the vulnerability description, along with the ability for a remote attacker to manipulate the processed input stream to execute commands, support this classification. The evidence from CVE-2021-39144 description confirms that the attacker can manipulate the processed input stream to inject objects, resulting in local command execution on the server.

CWE-915 was considered because the manipulation of the input stream leads to the modification of object attributes, which is a core aspect of CWE-915. While CWE-502 captures the overall process, CWE-915 provides a more granular view of the actions performed during deserialization.

The final decision is based on a comprehensive analysis of the vulnerability description, CVE reference, and the relationships between the candidate CWEs. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, providing a detailed and accurate representation of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Marshaling, Unmarshaling: Marshaling and unmarshaling are effectively synonyms for serialization and deserialization, respectively.
Pickling, Unpickling: In Python, the "pickle" functionality is used to perform serialization and deserialization.
PHP Object Injection: Some PHP application researchers use this term when attacking unsafe use of the unserialize() function; but it is also used for CWE-915.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-913
ChildOf -> CWE-913
PeerOf -> CWE-915

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between CWE-502 and CWE-915 need further exploration. CWE-915 is more narrowly scoped to object modification, and is not necessarily used for deserialization.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-12799:** chain: bypass of untrusted deserialization issue (CWE-502) by using an assumed-trusted class (CWE-183)
- **CVE-2015-8103:** Deserialization issue in commonly-used Java library allows remote execution.
- **CVE-2015-4852:** Deserialization issue in commonly-used Java library allows remote execution.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2016-9948**: Improperly controlled modification of dynamically-determined object attributes in Tiki Wiki allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by modifying the values of certain serialized PHP objects.
- **CVE-2013-4562**: In Jenkins, remote authenticated users with the Overall/Read permission can bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code by triggering deserialization of a crafted serialized Java object, leading to modification of dynamically-determined object attributes.
