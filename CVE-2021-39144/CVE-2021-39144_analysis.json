CWE-915 is a peer of CWE-502 and focuses on the modification of dynamically determined object attributes, providing a more specific view of the actions performed during the deserialization process. These relationships help to refine the understanding of the vulnerability by highlighting both the overall process (deserialization) and the specific actions that lead to the exploit (attribute modification).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    cwe915[\"CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Values\"]\n    \n    cwe502 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    cwe915 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    cwe502 -- PEEROF -- cwe915\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe502 primary\n    class cwe915 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the deserialization of untrusted data (CWE-502). This process allows an attacker to inject or replace objects in the input stream. These injected objects can then be used to modify object attributes (CWE-915), ultimately leading to the execution of arbitrary commands on the host system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed strongly towards CWE-502 due to the description of deserializing untrusted data. The key phrases \"**improper input sanitization**\" and \"**XML injection**\" in the vulnerability description, along with the ability for a remote attacker to manipulate the processed input stream to execute commands, support this classification. The evidence from CVE-2021-39144 description confirms that the attacker can manipulate the processed input stream to inject objects, resulting in local command execution on the server.\n\nCWE-915 was considered because the manipulation of the input stream leads to the modification of object attributes, which is a core aspect of CWE-915. While CWE-502 captures the overall process, CWE-915 provides a more granular view of the actions performed during deserialization.\n\nThe final decision is based on a comprehensive analysis of the vulnerability description, CVE reference, and the relationships between the candidate CWEs. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, providing a detailed and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nMarshaling, Unmarshaling: Marshaling and unmarshaling are effectively synonyms for serialization and deserialization, respectively.\nPickling, Unpickling: In Python, the \"pickle\" functionality is used to perform serialization and deserialization.\nPHP Object Injection: Some PHP application researchers use this term when attacking unsafe use of the unserialize() function; but it is also used for CWE-915.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-913\nChildOf -> CWE-913\nPeerOf -> CWE-915\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
