CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) is also selected because the **default password** cannot be changed by a user via any normally accessible means, which indicates that the **default password** is effectively **hard-coded**. CWE-1188 (Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default) is considered because the account is initialized with an insecure **default password**. CWE-912 (Hidden Functionality) is a potential secondary CWE because the account appears to be a backdoor for Technical Support staff, which is a functionality that is not documented.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1393[\"CWE-1393: Use of Default Password\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe1392[\"CWE-1392: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n    cwe1188[\"CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default\"]\n    cwe912[\"CWE-912: Hidden Functionality\"]\n    \n    cwe1393 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1392\n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1391\n    cwe1188 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1419\n    cwe1188 -->|CHILDOF| cwe665\n    cwe912 -->|CHILDOF| cwe684\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1393 primary\n    class cwe798,cwe1188,cwe912 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **default password** for the support user account, which leads to unauthorized access to the device.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-1393 (Use of Default Password) because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the presence of a **default password** for the support user account.
