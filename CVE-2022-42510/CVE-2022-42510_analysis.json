Its parent is CWE-119 **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**, a Class. It has child CWEs like CWE-127. The **rootcause** is the **improper input validation**, thus the relationship would be CWE-20 **Improper Input Validation** CanPrecede CWE-125. CWE-20 is a Class.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe125\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20), leading to an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125), which could then lead to local escalation of privilege.\n  - Root Cause: CWE-20 **Improper Input Validation**\n  - Weakness: CWE-125 **Out-of-bounds Read**\n  - Impact: Local escalation of privilege\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-125 **Out-of-bounds Read** as the primary weakness, based on the vulnerability description stating \"there is a possible **out of bounds read** due to **improper input validation**\". The provided information from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary states that the **root_cause** is \"**Improper validation** or handling of input within the rild_exynos component\". This confirms that **improper input validation** is the root cause of the weakness. Therefore, CWE-20 **Improper Input Validation** is also included as a secondary CWE.\n\nThe retriever results showed several candidate CWEs, but the vulnerability description clearly points to an **out-of-bounds read** due to **improper input validation**.\nCWE-125 **Out-of-bounds Read** is a Base level CWE and is more specific than its parent CWE-119.\nCWE-20 **Improper Input Validation** is a Class level CWE, and the mapping guidance discourages its use, suggesting considering lower-level children. However, in this case, the available information doesn't point to a more specific type of input validation issue.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity based on the provided evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\nThis CWE is not related to the vulnerability, which is caused by an **out of bounds read** due to **improper input validation**.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\nThis CWE is not related to the vulnerability, which is caused by an **out of bounds read** due to **improper input validation**.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis CWE is not related to the vulnerability, which is caused by an **out of bounds read** due to **improper input validation**.\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
