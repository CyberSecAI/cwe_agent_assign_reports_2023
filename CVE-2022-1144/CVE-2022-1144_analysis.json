The vulnerability description states: \"Use after free in WebUI in Google Chrome prior to 100.0.4896.60 allowed a remote attacker who convinced a user to engage in specific user interaction to potentially exploit **heap corruption** via specific input into DevTools.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also confirms the \"root_cause\" as \"Use after free in WebUI.\" with the weakness as \"Use After Free\" and \"impact\" as \"Arbitrary code execution\". The \"Retriever Results\" also list CWE-416 as the top combined result with a score of 0.421. CWE-416 is a Variant level CWE which is a preferred level of abstraction.\n\nCWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) was considered as a secondary candidate since the vulnerability description mentions **heap corruption**. It is possible that the **use after free** leads to **heap corruption** due to a buffer overflow. However, the description does not explicitly state a buffer overflow, therefore the confidence in CWE-122 is lower.\nCWE-366, CWE-843, CWE-665, CWE-1021, CWE-123, CWE-362, CWE-415, and CWE-404 were considered but are not the primary weakness. CWE-366 and CWE-362 relate to race conditions which are not explicitly mentioned in the vulnerability description. CWE-843 relates to type confusion, which is not applicable here. CWE-665 relates to improper initialization, which is also not applicable. CWE-1021 relates to clickjacking, which is not relevant. CWE-123 relates to write-what-where condition, which is a possible impact of use-after-free, but not the root cause. CWE-415 relates to double free, which is not applicable. CWE-404 relates to improper resource shutdown or release, which is not applicable.",
