This CWE is a Variant, which is a preferred level of abstraction. While other CWEs like **CWE-416 (Use After Free)** were considered due to their similarity, the explicit mention of \"double free\" in the vulnerability description makes **CWE-415** the most accurate choice. Other potential parent CWEs like **CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference)**, **CWE-1341 (Multiple Releases of Same Resource or Handle)**, and **CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiration)** were less specific.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe415[\"CWE-415: Double Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe1341[\"CWE-1341: Multiple Releases of Same Resource or Handle\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource after Expiration\"]\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n\n    cwe415 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe415 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1341\n    cwe415 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe415 -->|PEEROF| cwe416\n    cwe415 -->|PEEROF| cwe123\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe415 primary\n    class cwe825,cwe1341,cwe672,cwe416,cwe123 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward: a **double free** (**CWE-415**) leads to heap corruption. The provided information doesn't elaborate on what caused the double free, only that it exists.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the explicit mention of \"**double free**\" in the \"**Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**\". The vulnerability description states: \"Double free in WebGL in Google Chrome prior to 102.0.5005.115 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.\" This directly corresponds to the definition of **CWE-415 (Double Free)**, which involves calling free() twice on the same memory address, leading to memory corruption.\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that **CWE-415** is a specific type of memory management error related to resource expiration (**CWE-825** and **CWE-672**) and can be considered a peer of similar issues like **use-after-free** (**CWE-416**). The \"**Retriever Results**\" also list **CWE-415** as the top match.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the **rootcause** of the vulnerability as a \"**double free**\" condition.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
