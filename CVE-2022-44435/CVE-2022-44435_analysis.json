It has a ChildOf relationship to CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization). The description clearly indicates a **missing permission check**, which directly relates to **missing authorization**. CWE-770 is included as a secondary CWE because a **missing permission check** could lead to a denial of service by allowing excessive resource allocation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|ChildOf| cwe284\n    cwe862 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    cwe770 -->|ChildOf| cwe400\n    cwe770 -->|ChildOf| cwe665\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission check** (CWE-862). This lack of authorization can lead to excessive resource allocation, which in turn causes a denial of service (DoS). The chain is:\nCWE-862 (Missing Authorization) -> CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) -> DoS\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **missing permission check** as the root cause. The provided information explicitly states \"**missing permission check**\" as the root cause in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\".\nThe primary CWE match from the provided information is CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), which aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description. The retriever results also list CWE-862 as the top candidate.\nThe relationship analysis shows that CWE-862 is a Class-level CWE, and while it has potential Base-level children, none are more appropriate given the information provided.\nCWE-770 is added as a secondary weakness, because the missing permission check allows anyone to allocate resources without limit which causes the DoS.\nI am confident in this assessment because it is directly supported by the provided vulnerability description and key phrases. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, accurately representing the weakness and its potential impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
