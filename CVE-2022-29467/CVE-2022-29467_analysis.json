CWE-359 is more specific as it relates to the exposure of private personal information, so I have included that as a secondary CWE. CWE-285 is a parent of CWE-862, and CWE-862 is a class level CWE, so I have included that as a secondary CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe359,cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **componentAddress information disclosure** which then leads to the impact of an attacker being able to obtain some data of Address. I have chosen to include CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) as a potential secondary cause for the information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **Address information disclosure vulnerability** as the root cause. The primary CWE selected was CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor because the vulnerability description indicates that a remote authenticated attacker can obtain some data of Address. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" indicates that \"The core issue is that the system improperly handles access to address information, leading to unauthorized disclosure.\" The Retriever Results also list CWE-200 as the top combined result. However, CWE-200 is a class level CWE and is discouraged from being used, therefore I have also added CWE-359 Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability description indicates that the information that is being disclosed is address information.\n\nI considered other CWEs from the Retriever Results, such as CWE-285 and CWE-862, but they seemed less directly related to the core issue of information exposure. However, I am including CWE-862, Missing Authorization, as a secondary CWE since that may also be a contributing factor in the information disclosure.\n\nI believe the selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately reflect the root cause and impact of the vulnerability, based on the available evidence.",
