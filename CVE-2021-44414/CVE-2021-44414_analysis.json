CWE-400 is a more general class related to resource consumption, but it is considered a secondary candidate because the reboot is a consequence of the initial **improper input validation**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe400 -->|CAUSES| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper input validation** (CWE-20), which leads to a crash of the `cgiserver.cgi` process, and finally results in a denial-of-service condition causing the device to reboot (CWE-400).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis and the provided evidence strongly support the classification of this vulnerability as CWE-20 (**Improper Input Validation**). The `cgiserver.cgi` process **fails to validate** the type of JSON input for the `param` field, which leads to a type mismatch and a crash.\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly states: \"Improper Input Validation (CWE-20) - The application does not properly validate the type of JSON input for the `param` field, leading to a type mismatch.\" This quote directly supports the selection of CWE-20.\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-20 is the root cause, and the denial-of-service condition (CWE-400) is a consequence. The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it precisely describes the **lack of proper input validation**, which is the core weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity
