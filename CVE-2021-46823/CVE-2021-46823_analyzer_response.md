# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2021-46823

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1333 | Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.5 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the `ChildOf` relationship between CWE-1333 and CWE-407, indicating that inefficient regular expression complexity is a specific type of inefficient algorithmic complexity. While CWE-407 is a broader category, CWE-1333 provides a more precise description of the vulnerability. The `ChildOf` relationship between CWE-1333 and CWE-407 helped refine the initial selection towards the more specific CWE-1333. CWE-400 as a parent of CWE-770 also showed that resource consumption is a main concern, however, the regex inefficiency is the main weakness.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the use of a poorly crafted regular expression (CWE-1333) in the LDAP schema parser. This leads to excessive CPU consumption due to catastrophic backtracking, resulting in a denial-of-service condition (CWE-400) when parsing untrusted schema definitions.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the denial-of-service vulnerability in python-ldap. The vulnerability description clearly states a **regular expression denial of service** (ReDoS) flaw in the LDAP schema parser. This aligns directly with CWE-1333, which describes the use of an inefficient regular expression that consumes excessive CPU cycles.

The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms this, stating that "The vulnerability stems from a poorly crafted regular expression used in the LDAP schema parser which is susceptible to ReDoS attacks." and "A successful attack can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by consuming excessive resources of the system parsing the schema."

CWE-1333 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level, and its description accurately matches the vulnerability: "The product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles."

CWE-400 was considered as a potential secondary CWE, given the denial-of-service impact. However, CWE-1333 more precisely identifies the root cause, while CWE-400 describes the resulting uncontrolled resource consumption. CWE-400 is also discouraged. Therefore, CWE-1333 is the primary CWE, and CWE-400 is a secondary consideration.

The final decision is strongly based on the provided evidence and the CWE specifications, making CWE-1333 the most appropriate and specific classification for this vulnerability.
Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives a complex input with multiple elements or fields that must be consistent with each other, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually consistent.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-606: Unchecked Input for Loop Condition
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly check inputs that are used for loop conditions, potentially leading to a denial of service or other consequences because of excessive looping.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is "asymmetric."

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review

**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
