The vulnerability description states that the product uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms, which directly aligns with the definition of CWE-327. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary supports this by mentioning \"crypto vulnerabilities.\"\n\nThe relationship graph influenced the decision to consider CWE-326 and CWE-1240 as secondary options. While the primary issue seems to be the use of a broken or risky algorithm, there's a possibility that the algorithm itself is theoretically sound but has inadequate encryption strength (CWE-326) or that the implementation of the cryptographic primitive is risky (CWE-1240).\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, given the available information.
