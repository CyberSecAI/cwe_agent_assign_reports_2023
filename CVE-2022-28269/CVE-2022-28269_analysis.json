The description of CWE-416 matches the vulnerability description, \"The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed.\" The mapping guidance for CWE-416 says that usage is allowed.\n\nCWE-401 (**CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime**) is a variant-level CWE. The description of CWE-401 matches the impact of the vulnerability, \"The product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.\" The mapping guidance for CWE-401 says that usage is allowed.\n\nCWE-787 (**CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write**), CWE-125 (**CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read**), and CWE-788 (**CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer**) were not selected as the vulnerability description explicitly states \"**use-after-free**\" as the root cause. These CWEs are related to buffer overflows and out-of-bounds access.\n\nCWE-200 (**CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**) was not selected because the vulnerability is not directly related to the mishandling of sensitive information, as the description of CWE-200 discusses.\n\nMy assessment is based on the provided evidence only, and the selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity.",
