It is a class-level CWE. It is a child of CWE-285 Improper Authorization and CWE-284 Improper Access Control. CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key is a child of CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization, and could be a potential alternative if the vulnerability involved manipulation of keys.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper api route checking** (root cause), leading to **missing authorization**, and ultimately allowing attackers to modify customers and create orders without App Permission (impact).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the issue is due to **improper api route checking**, which results in **missing authorization** for certain API endpoints. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the `/api/_proxy/switch-customer` route lacks proper access control checks, allowing unauthorized modification of customers and order creation.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is based on the evidence: \"The root cause of the vulnerability is a missing access control check in the Shopware core...Specifically, the `api_proxy_switch-customer` privilege was not properly required for this route.\"\n\nCWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is the most appropriate CWE because the **root cause** is the lack of any authorization check.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization): This was considered but deemed less accurate because the vulnerability is due to a complete lack of authorization, not an incorrect authorization implementation.\n*   CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key): This was also considered, but it is more specific to situations where a user-controlled key is used to bypass authorization. The current vulnerability doesn't explicitly mention key manipulation.\n*   CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')): Not applicable as the vulnerability is about authorization, not about XSS.\n*   CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)): Not applicable as the vulnerability is about authorization, not about CSRF.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately captures the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the absence of authorization checks.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component that specifies multiple attributes, properties, or fields that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control which attributes can be modified.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
