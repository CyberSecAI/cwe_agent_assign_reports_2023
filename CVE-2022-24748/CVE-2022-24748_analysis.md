|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 1.0 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-862 **Missing Authorization**. It is a class-level CWE. It is a child of CWE-285 Improper Authorization and CWE-284 Improper Access Control. CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key is a child of CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization, and could be a potential alternative if the vulnerability involved manipulation of keys.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper api route checking** (root cause), leading to **missing authorization**, and ultimately allowing attackers to modify customers and create orders without App Permission (impact).

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly states that the issue is due to **improper api route checking**, which results in **missing authorization** for certain API endpoints. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms that the `/api/_proxy/switch-customer` route lacks proper access control checks, allowing unauthorized modification of customers and order creation.

The selection of CWE-862 is based on the evidence: "The root cause of the vulnerability is a missing access control check in the Shopware core...Specifically, the `api_proxy_switch-customer` privilege was not properly required for this route."

CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is the most appropriate CWE because the **root cause** is the lack of any authorization check.

Other CWEs Considered:

*   CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization): This was considered but deemed less accurate because the vulnerability is due to a complete lack of authorization, not an incorrect authorization implementation.
*   CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key): This was also considered, but it is more specific to situations where a user-controlled key is used to bypass authorization. The current vulnerability doesn't explicitly mention key manipulation.
*   CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')): Not applicable as the vulnerability is about authorization, not about XSS.
*   CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)): Not applicable as the vulnerability is about authorization, not about CSRF.

The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately captures the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the absence of authorization checks.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

## CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component that specifies multiple attributes, properties, or fields that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control which attributes can be modified.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
