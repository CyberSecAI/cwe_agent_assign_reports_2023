It has child relationships to CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). CWE-306, Missing Authentication for Critical Function, is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-287, Improper Authentication. CWE-425, Direct Request ('Forced Browsing'), is a base-level CWE that has child relationships with CWE-862 and CWE-288 (Authorization Bypass Through Alternate Channel). The choice of CWE-862 as the primary CWE is appropriate because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions **missing authorization**. The other CWEs considered are related to authorization and access control, but they are either too general or not specific enough to accurately represent the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Through Alternate Channel\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe288\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe425 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284,cwe287,cwe288 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** in a REST endpoint. This allows unauthenticated users to directly request and retrieve WordPress user details, such as name and email address.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **missing authorization** in the REST endpoint, which allows unauthenticated users to retrieve WordPress user details. The vulnerability description key phrases highlight \"**missing authorisation**\" as the root cause and \"retrieve WordPress users details\" as the impact. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the REST endpoint `/wp-json/ssa/v1/users` lacks authorization checks.\n\nThe Retriever Results identified CWE-862, Missing Authorization, as the top candidate. The description of CWE-862, \"The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action,\" aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description. The usage is \"Allowed-with-Review\" because it is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate.\n\nCWE-306, Missing Authentication for Critical Function, was considered because it addresses the lack of authentication. While the vulnerability description focuses on authorization, the absence of authentication contributes to the issue. However, since authorization is explicitly mentioned, CWE-862 is more appropriate as the primary CWE.\n\nCWE-425, Direct Request ('Forced Browsing'), was also considered as unauthenticated users can directly request user details.\n\nThe final decision is to assign CWE-862 as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the **missing authorization** in the REST endpoint. CWE-306 and CWE-425 are secondary because they relate to the lack of authentication and the ability to directly access the resource, respectively. The selection is at the optimal level of specificity, as CWE-862 is a Class, but its children are not as relevant to the specific vulnerability. The evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary strongly support this classification.\nThe graph relationships support the primary selection of CWE-862, as it is related to both authentication (CWE-306) and direct request (CWE-425) vulnerabilities.\nBased on the evidence provided, the selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
