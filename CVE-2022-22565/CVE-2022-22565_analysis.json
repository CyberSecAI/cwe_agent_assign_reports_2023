CWE-497 is a broader category related to the exposure of sensitive information, which is a consequence of the **improper authorization**. CWE-863 is a class-level CWE for **incorrect authorization** and might be too high-level but provides a connection to access control issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe612[\"CWE-612: Improper Authorization of Index Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe612 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1230[\"CWE-1230\"]\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe612 primary\n    class cwe497,cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284,cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper authorization** of the index (CWE-612), which leads to the exposure of sensitive information (CWE-497).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly supports CWE-612 due to the explicit mention of **improper authorization** of an index containing sensitive information in both the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary: \"**Rootcause: improper authorization of index containing sensitive information**\" and \"**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present: Insufficient access control on an index that stores sensitive data.**\"\n\nCWE-497 is considered as a secondary CWE because the **exposure of sensitive system information** is a direct result of the **improper authorization**.\n\nCWE-863 is also considered because the root cause mentioned \"**improper authorization**\" which is what this CWE describes, but it is a class level CWE so its score is lowered.\n\nCWE-284 \"Improper Access Control\" is discouraged as the primary CWE by MITRE because it is a very high-level pillar.\n\nBased on the evidence and the CWE descriptions, CWE-612 is the most specific and appropriate mapping at the Base level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
