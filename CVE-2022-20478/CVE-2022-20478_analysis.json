CWE-770 describes a specific scenario where resources are allocated without restrictions, leading to potential exhaustion. CWE-1284 **Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input** can precede CWE-770 if the quantity of resources to allocate is taken from untrusted input. CWE-789 **Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value** is a variant of CWE-770 and specializes in memory allocation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe770\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe1284,cwe789 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of limits on the size of NotificationChannel and NotificationChannelGroup objects**, potentially stemming from **improper validation of input quantities (CWE-1284)**, leading to **uncontrolled allocation of resources (CWE-770)**, and ultimately causing **resource exhaustion**, which results in the **failure to persist permissions settings**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-770 as the primary candidate based on the description of **resource exhaustion** due to a **lack of size limits** and the retriever results. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly states that \"The vulnerability stems from a **lack of size limits** on `NotificationChannel` and `NotificationChannelGroup` objects,\" directly supporting CWE-770.\n\nThe vulnerability description key phrases also point to **resource exhaustion**. The retriever results also had CWE-770 high on the list.\n\nCWE-400, **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**, was considered but deemed too general. While the vulnerability does lead to uncontrolled resource consumption, the root cause is the **unlimited allocation of resources**, making CWE-770 a more precise fit. The mapping guidance for CWE-400 even suggests considering children like CWE-770 for more specific mappings. CWE-789 **Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value** is a variant of CWE-770 and specializes in memory allocation. It is possible that this could be the rootcause, however, the description doesn't specify memory allocation, but rather notification channels and groups. Therefore, CWE-770 is a better fit.\n\nCWE-1284, **Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input**, was also considered as a potential preceding weakness. If the size of the `NotificationChannel` and `NotificationChannelGroup` objects is derived from user input, the lack of validation would contribute to the vulnerability. However, without explicit evidence of untrusted input, CWE-1284 is a secondary consideration.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-770 directly addresses the **unlimited allocation of resources**, which is the **root cause** of the **resource exhaustion**. More general CWEs like CWE-400 would not capture the specific nature of the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n## CWE-1021: Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not restrict or incorrectly restricts frame objects or UI layers that belong to another application or domain, which can lead to user confusion about which interface the user is interacting with.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
