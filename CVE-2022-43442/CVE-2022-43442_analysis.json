CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) was also considered because it is closely related and represents a broader class of issues involving sensitive data. However, since the description specifically mentions \"password\", CWE-256 is a more precise fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    \n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe312 -->|PEEROF| cwe256\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe312 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **plaintext storage of the password** (CWE-256), which allows an attacker to **obtain the login password** and then **log in to the management console**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference, which clearly state the **root cause** as **\"plaintext storage of password\"**. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-256 as the most relevant CWE.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"Plaintext storage of a password vulnerability exists in +F FS040U software versions v2.3.4 and earlier, which may allow an attacker to obtain the login password of +F FS040U and log in to the management console.\"\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"The vulnerability is due to the plaintext storage of a password in the affected device.\" and \"Plaintext Storage of a Password (CWE-256). This means the device stores the user's password without any encryption or hashing, making it easily readable.\"\n\nCWE-256 is selected because it accurately represents the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is storing passwords in **plaintext**, making them easily accessible to attackers. This directly leads to the attacker's ability to obtain the login password and access the management console.\n\nCWE-312 was considered but not selected as the primary because while it addresses the general case of \"sensitive information,\" the vulnerability specifically refers to a \"password,\" making CWE-256 a more precise mapping. Other CWEs like CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) and CWE-257 (Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format) were not selected because the vulnerability involves storing the password in plaintext, not hashing or encryption that can be recovered.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nStoring a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.\n\n### Extended Description\nPassword management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-522\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30275:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.",
