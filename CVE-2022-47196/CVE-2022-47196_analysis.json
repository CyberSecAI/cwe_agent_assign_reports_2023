CWE-79 can be related to CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery). The secondary CWE is CWE-1188, which is a Base level weakness and a ChildOf CWE-1419 (Improper Initialization) and CWE-665 (Improper Control of Resource Identifiers).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe1188[\"CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default\"]\n    cwe1419[\"CWE-1419: Incorrect Initialization\"]\n    cwe665[\"CWE-665: Improper Control of Resource Identifiers\"]\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    \n    cwe1188 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1419\n    cwe1188 -->|CHILDOF| cwe665\n    cwe79 -->|PEEROF| cwe352\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe1188 secondary\n    class cwe1419,cwe665,cwe352 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of weaknesses is:\n1.  **Insecure default configuration** (CWE-1188) allowing arbitrary Javascript injection.\n2.  Improper neutralization of input during web page generation (CWE-79).\n3.  Privilege escalation to administrator.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis identifies two CWEs: CWE-79 (Primary) and CWE-1188 (Secondary).\n\nCWE-79 is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly indicate a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability due to a lack of input sanitization. The **root cause** allows a non-administrator user to inject arbitrary Javascript in posts that are then viewed by an administrator. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-79, which states that the product does not neutralize user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page served to other users.\n\nCWE-1188 is selected as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability description mentions an **insecure default configuration** that allows the Javascript injection. This aligns with the description of CWE-1188, which states that the product initializes a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure.\n\nThe other CWEs listed in the Retriever Results were considered, but they were not selected because they did not accurately describe the vulnerability. For example, CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery) was considered because there can be a relationship between XSS and CSRF, but the vulnerability description does not indicate that CSRF is involved. The vulnerability description clearly focuses on the improper neutralization of input, which is the defining characteristic of XSS, and insecure default configurations.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately describe the **root cause** of the vulnerability. CWE-79 is a Base level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the **root causes** of vulnerabilities. CWE-1188 is a Base level CWE and a contributing factor to the vulnerability.\n\nEvidence:\n*   Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: \"**weakness:** **insecure default configuration**\"\n*   CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"The **root cause** is an insecure default configuration in Ghost CMS that allows a user to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the `codeinjection_head` field of a post.
