CWE-212 has a parent-child relationship with CWE-669 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements). While CWE-201 is related, it is more about the insertion of sensitive data, whereas CWE-212 focuses on the failure to remove it. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is higher level but captures the authorization bypass aspect.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n    cwe669[\"CWE-669: Incorrect Behavior Order: Authorization Before Parsing and Canonicalization\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe212 -->|CHILDOF| cwe669\n    cwe212 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe201\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe212 primary\n    class cwe669,cwe201,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the application's use of `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` to specify an `Authorization` header. Upon a redirect to a different origin, the **failure to remove** this header leads to the **insertion of sensitive information** into the redirected request. This constitutes an **improper authorization**, as the header is sent to an unintended domain.\n  - Root Cause: **Improper handling of redirects** (**failure to remove** the Authorization header).\n  - Weakness: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Sent Data.\n  - Impact: Sensitive authorization headers are sent to unintended domains.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified several candidate CWEs, including CWE-212, CWE-863, and CWE-201. The final decision emphasizes CWE-212 as the primary weakness because the core issue is the **improper removal** of the `Authorization` header during redirects. The other CWEs capture related aspects, such as the resulting insertion of sensitive data (CWE-201) and the incorrect authorization context (CWE-863).\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision is derived from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" which states: \"The `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` and `CURLOPT_USERPWD` options were not being cleared when a redirect occurred to a different origin... This could result in the client sending authorization headers to an unintended domain during a redirect.\" The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" also highlights the \"improper handling of redirects.\"\n\nCWE-212 is at the Base level of abstraction, which aligns with the goal of identifying the specific coding error.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it **does not properly remove** that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
