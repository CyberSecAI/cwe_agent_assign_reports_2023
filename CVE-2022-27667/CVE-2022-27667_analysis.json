It is a child of CWE-668. CWE-668 describes the exposure of resources to the wrong sphere, which is a higher-level abstraction. CWE-306 represents missing authentication which could lead to unauthorized access and information exposure. The relationships suggest that the core issue is an exposure problem (CWE-200), potentially due to a broader resource control issue (CWE-668) or missing authentication (CWE-306).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe668,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a potential configuration issue or **missing authorization** in the SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence platform's Client Management Console (CMC). This **weakness** leads to an attacker being able to access restricted information, resulting in **information disclosure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis indicates that the vulnerability involves an **attacker** gaining access to restricted information within the SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence platform. The key phrase \"access information which would otherwise be restricted, leading to Information Disclosure\" from the **Vulnerability Description** points towards an authorization or access control issue.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly states \"Information Disclosure,\" which aligns with the core concern of CWE-200. While CWE-200 is often misused, in this case, the description directly supports it.\n\nCWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) is considered as a secondary CWE because the description implies that a resource (the restricted information) is exposed to the wrong control sphere (the **attacker**). However, CWE-668 is a higher-level class and the evidence is not strong enough to definitively determine if the exposure is due to a broader resource control issue.\n\nCWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is considered as a secondary CWE because the missing or insufficient authentication can lead to information exposure.\n\nThe decision to prioritize CWE-200 is based on the direct statement of \"Information Disclosure\" in the **Vulnerability Description**, making it the most specific and relevant CWE. The other CWEs are considered contributing factors but are less directly supported by the provided evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
