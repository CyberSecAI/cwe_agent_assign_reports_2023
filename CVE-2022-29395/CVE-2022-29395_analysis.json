Considered because of the buffer copy operation, but CWE-121 is a better fit. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-121, which is a variant of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). The relationship shows that CWE-121 is a specific type of buffer overflow that occurs on the stack. CWE-120 is a parent of CWE-121, but CWE-121 is more specific.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe788[\"CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After the End of the Intended Buffer\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\"]\n\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe788\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe788 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe788,cwe787,cwe119,cwe120 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of** input validation, specifically the **absence of** a length check on the `apcliKey` parameter, leading to a **stack overflow** when the overly long input is copied to a stack-based buffer. The overflow can then lead to arbitrary code execution by overwriting the return address.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-121 as the most relevant based on the description containing \"**stack overflow**\" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary section indicating that the `apcliKey` parameter is copied into a local stack variable without any length validation. This aligns with the description of CWE-121 as a condition where a buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack.\n\nThe \"**weakness:** **stack overflow**\" key phrase reinforces this determination. The description \"This function retrieves the `apcliKey` parameter from a JSON request and copies it into a local stack variable without performing any length validation\" is direct evidence for CWE-121.\n\nThe retriever results also listed CWE-121 as the top result with a score of 1.0.\n\nCWE-120 was considered because the vulnerability involves a buffer copy operation, as stated in the \"Root cause of vulnerability\" from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"This function retrieves the `apcliKey` parameter from a JSON request and copies it into a local stack variable without performing any length validation.\" However, since the overflow occurs specifically on the stack, CWE-121 is the more precise and appropriate choice.\n\nThe choice of CWE-121 is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level according to MITRE mapping guidance.",
