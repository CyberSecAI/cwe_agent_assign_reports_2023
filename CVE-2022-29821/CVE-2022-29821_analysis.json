This indicates that template injection is a specific form of code injection. However, the evidence is lacking to definitively say that template injection is happening here.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    \n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe1336 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the improper handling of links in ReSharper Quick Documentation, leading to potential code execution. The **WEAKNESS** stems from the lack of proper neutralization or sanitization of these links. This ultimately leads to the **impact** of local code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the local code execution vulnerability in JetBrains Rider. The vulnerability description indicates that the issue arises from links within the ReSharper Quick Documentation, which can lead to code execution.\n\nThe retriever results suggest several potential CWEs, including CWE-94, CWE-1336, CWE-61, and CWE-59.\nBased on the evidence available, CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')) seems to be the most relevant primary weakness. The vulnerability description states that local code execution is possible, which aligns with the potential impact of CWE-94. However, the description doesn't provide enough detail to confirm the exact mechanism of code injection.\n\nCWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) is considered as a possible secondary weakness, since the ReSharper Quick Documentation may be using a template engine to render the documentation. If the links are not properly neutralized, it could lead to code injection. However, this is speculative and requires more information.\n\nThe provided evidence is not very strong, as the CVE Reference Links Content Summary is \"UNRELATED\". The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** point to a local code execution **impact**, with the **vector** being links in ReSharper Quick Documentation.\n\nUltimately, the selection of CWE-94 is based on the possibility of code injection and the lack of specific information to pinpoint a more precise weakness. CWE-1336 is a secondary consideration because it is a child of CWE-94 and could be a more specific case of code injection if a template engine is involved. However, without more information, the confidence in this mapping remains moderate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-99: Improper Control of Resource Identifiers ('Resource Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not restrict or incorrectly restricts the input before it is used as an identifier for a resource that may be outside the intended sphere of control.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
