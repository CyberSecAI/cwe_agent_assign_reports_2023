## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-497 | Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | 0.5 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** LOW

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the assessment is the ChildOf relationship of CWE-497 to CWE-200, indicating a more specific type of information exposure. CWE-522 is related to the protection of credentials, but the description focuses more on the exposure aspect, making CWE-497 a better fit.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain involves the **impact** of exposing passwords from protected fields, potentially stemming from **missing** or **insufficient** protection mechanisms within the JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA application. This leads to unauthorized access to sensitive information.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis centered on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, focusing on the exposure of sensitive information. The vulnerability description states, "In JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA before 2021.3.3 it was possible to **get passwords from protected fields**." This statement highlights the core issue of sensitive information exposure.

Given the limited evidence, the assessment relies heavily on the CWE descriptions and relationships. CWE-497, "Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere," is chosen as the primary CWE due to its direct relevance to the vulnerability. The description of CWE-497 states, "The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does." This aligns with the vulnerability description, where passwords (sensitive information) are accessible when they should be protected.

CWE-522, "Insufficiently Protected Credentials," was considered but deemed less specific. While the vulnerability involves passwords, the primary issue is the exposure itself rather than the method of protection.

The chosen CWE is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred for mapping root causes. The decision is based on the available evidence and the CWE descriptions, focusing on the exposure aspect of the vulnerability. The confidence score is 0.7, reflecting the uncertainty due to limited information.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.81
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

## CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 7333.82
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.
