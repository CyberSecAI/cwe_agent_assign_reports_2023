This is a child of **CWE-285 (Improper Authorization)**, but **CWE-862** is more specific as it directly points to the absence of an authorization check. **CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor)** is a related impact, as the lack of authorization leads to the exposure of user email addresses. **CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor)** is a specific type of **CWE-200** and can be considered because the email addresses are considered private personal information. The abstraction level of **CWE-862** is Class, but since it is directly related to the **missing authorization**, it can be considered as the Primary CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe200,cwe359 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check (**CWE-862**), which then leads to the **exposure of sensitive information** (**CWE-200**) like email addresses (**CWE-359**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment points to the lack of proper authorization as the root cause, leading to the exposure of sensitive user information. The primary weakness is the **missing authorization** check on the AJAX action, which directly violates access control. This is strongly supported by the vulnerability description, which states, \"The vulnerability is due to an AJAX action in the Directorist plugin that discloses email addresses of all users. This action is accessible without authentication, meaning anyone can trigger it.\" The graph relationships clearly show the link between **missing authorization** and **information exposure**. The final decision prioritizes **CWE-862** due to its direct relevance to the **missing authorization** issue, making it the most appropriate choice. **CWE-200** and **CWE-359** are secondary effects as they describe the result of the initial **missing authorization**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n**CWE-862: Missing Authorization**\n*   The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n*   The AJAX action `directorist_author_pagination` does not require authentication.\n\n**CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**\n*   The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n*   User email addresses are exposed through an unauthenticated AJAX endpoint.\n\n**CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor**\n*   The product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected.\n*   Attackers can retrieve email addresses of all users of the WordPress site.\n\n**CWEs Considered But Not Used:**\n\n*   **CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF))**: While present in the Retriever Results, this CWE is not applicable as the vulnerability does not require tricking a user into making an unintentional request.\n*   **CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization)**: This CWE is not as relevant as **CWE-862** because the issue is the *absence* of authorization rather than an incorrect authorization implementation.\n*   **CWE-285 (Improper Authorization)**: This is a high-level class, and **CWE-862** is a more specific child that better describes the vulnerability.\n*   **CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor)**: A more specific child of **CWE-200**, it is considered as a secondary weakness.\n*   **CWE-1272 (Sensitive Information Uncleared Before Debug/Power State Transition)**: Irrelevant to the described vulnerability.\n*   **CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data)**: Irrelevant to the described vulnerability.\n*   **CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication)**: Not applicable because the issue is the absence of authentication, not a weak authentication mechanism.\n*   **CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data)**: While sensitive information is sent, the root cause is the lack of authorization, not the insertion itself.",
