# Analysis for CVE-2022-2376

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 1 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.9 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-359 | Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness identified is **CWE-862 (Missing Authorization)**, as the AJAX action `directorist_author_pagination` does not require authentication, leading to unauthorized access. This is a child of **CWE-285 (Improper Authorization)**, but **CWE-862** is more specific as it directly points to the absence of an authorization check. **CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor)** is a related impact, as the lack of authorization leads to the exposure of user email addresses. **CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor)** is a specific type of **CWE-200** and can be considered because the email addresses are considered private personal information. The abstraction level of **CWE-862** is Class, but since it is directly related to the **missing authorization**, it can be considered as the Primary CWE.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check (**CWE-862**), which then leads to the **exposure of sensitive information** (**CWE-200**) like email addresses (**CWE-359**).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment points to the lack of proper authorization as the root cause, leading to the exposure of sensitive user information. The primary weakness is the **missing authorization** check on the AJAX action, which directly violates access control. This is strongly supported by the vulnerability description, which states, "The vulnerability is due to an AJAX action in the Directorist plugin that discloses email addresses of all users. This action is accessible without authentication, meaning anyone can trigger it." The graph relationships clearly show the link between **missing authorization** and **information exposure**. The final decision prioritizes **CWE-862** due to its direct relevance to the **missing authorization** issue, making it the most appropriate choice. **CWE-200** and **CWE-359** are secondary effects as they describe the result of the initial **missing authorization**.

Relevant CWE Information:

**CWE-862: Missing Authorization**
*   The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.
*   The AJAX action `directorist_author_pagination` does not require authentication.

**CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**
*   The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.
*   User email addresses are exposed through an unauthenticated AJAX endpoint.

**CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor**
*   The product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected.
*   Attackers can retrieve email addresses of all users of the WordPress site.

**CWEs Considered But Not Used:**

*   **CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF))**: While present in the Retriever Results, this CWE is not applicable as the vulnerability does not require tricking a user into making an unintentional request.
*   **CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization)**: This CWE is not as relevant as **CWE-862** because the issue is the *absence* of authorization rather than an incorrect authorization implementation.
*   **CWE-285 (Improper Authorization)**: This is a high-level class, and **CWE-862** is a more specific child that better describes the vulnerability.
*   **CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor)**: A more specific child of **CWE-200**, it is considered as a secondary weakness.
*   **CWE-1272 (Sensitive Information Uncleared Before Debug/Power State Transition)**: Irrelevant to the described vulnerability.
*   **CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data)**: Irrelevant to the described vulnerability.
*   **CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication)**: Not applicable because the issue is the absence of authentication, not a weak authentication mechanism.
*   **CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data)**: While sensitive information is sent, the root cause is the lack of authorization, not the insertion itself.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction:** Compound
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

### Extended Description
When a web server is designed to receive a request from a client without any mechanism for verifying that it was intentionally sent, then it might be possible for an attacker to trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server which will be treated as an authentic request. This can be done via a URL, image load, XMLHttpRequest, etc. and can result in exposure of data or unintended code execution.

### Alternative Terms
Session Riding
Cross Site Reference Forgery
XSRF

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-345
ChildOf -> CWE-345
Requires -> CWE-346
Requires -> CWE-441
Requires -> CWE-642
Requires -> CWE-613

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.
**Comments:** While attack-oriented composites are supported in CWE, they have not been a focus of research. There is a chance that future research or CWE scope clarifications will change or deprecate them. Perform root-cause analysis to determine if other weaknesses allow CSRF attacks to occur, and map to those weaknesses. For example, predictable CSRF tokens might allow bypass of CSRF protection mechanisms; if this occurs, they might be better characterized as randomness/predictability weaknesses.
**Reasons:**
- Other


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

There can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.


**[Theoretical]** 

The CSRF topology is multi-channel:


  - Attacker (as outsider) to intermediary (as user). The interaction point is either an external or internal channel.

  - Intermediary (as user) to server (as victim). The activation point is an internal channel.

## CWE-862: Missing Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships

### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description


Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.


When access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.


### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information
- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.
- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.




## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.

### Extended Description


There are many different kinds of mistakes that introduce information exposures. The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker. Some kinds of sensitive information include:


  - private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details

  - system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages

  - business secrets and intellectual property

  - network status and configuration

  - the product's own code or internal state

  - metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers

  - indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider

Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected. These parties include:

  - the product's own users

  - people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users

  - the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates

  - the developer

Information exposures can occur in different ways:

  - the code  **explicitly inserts**  sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been "scrubbed" or "sanitized"

  - a different weakness or mistake  **indirectly inserts**  the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.

  - the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are  **unintentionally made accessible**  to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.

It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an "information exposure," but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read. CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store, transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

### Alternative Terms
Information Disclosure: This term is frequently used in vulnerability advisories to describe a consequence or technical impact, for any vulnerability that has a loss of confidentiality. Often, CWE-200 can be misused to represent the loss of confidentiality, even when the mistake - i.e., the weakness - is not directly related to the mishandling of the information itself, such as an out-of-bounds read that accesses sensitive memory contents; here, the out-of-bounds read is the primary weakness, not the disclosure of the memory. In addition, this phrase is also used frequently in policies and legal documents, but it does not refer to any disclosure of security-relevant information.
Information Leak: This is a frequently used term, however the "leak" term has multiple uses within security. In some cases it deals with the accidental exposure of information from a different weakness, but in other cases (such as "memory leak"), this deals with improper tracking of resources, which can lead to exhaustion. As a result, CWE is actively avoiding usage of the "leak" term.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].
**Comments:** If an error or mistake causes information to be disclosed, then use the CWE ID for that error. Consider starting with improper authorization (CWE-285), insecure permissions (CWE-732), improper authentication (CWE-287), etc. Also consider children such as Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data (CWE-201), Observable Discrepancy (CWE-203), Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory (CWE-538), or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As a result of mapping analysis in the 2020 Top 25 and more recent versions, this weakness is under review, since it is frequently misused in mapping to cover many problems that lead to loss of confidentiality. See Mapping Notes, Extended Description, and Alternate Terms.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-31162:** Rust library leaks Oauth client details in application debug logs
- **CVE-2021-25476:** Digital Rights Management (DRM) capability for mobile platform leaks pointer information, simplifying ASLR bypass
- **CVE-2001-1483:** Enumeration of valid usernames based on inconsistent responses




## CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Privacy violation
Privacy leak
Privacy leakage

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-200

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry overlaps many other entries that are not organized around the kind of sensitive information that is exposed. However, because privacy is treated with such importance due to regulations and other factors, and it may be useful for weakness-finding tools to highlight capabilities that detect personal private information instead of system information, it is not clear whether - and how - this entry should be deprecated.

**[Other]** 

There are many types of sensitive information that products must protect from attackers, including system data, communications, configuration, business secrets, intellectual property, and an individual's personal (private) information. Private personal information may include a password, phone number, geographic location, personal messages, credit card number, etc. Private information is important to consider whether the person is a user of the product, or part of a data set that is processed by the product. An exposure of private information does not necessarily prevent the product from working properly, and in fact the exposure might be intended by the developer, e.g. as part of data sharing with other organizations. However, the exposure of personal private information can still be undesirable or explicitly prohibited by law or regulation.


Some types of private information include:


  - Government identifiers, such as Social Security Numbers

  - Contact information, such as home addresses and telephone numbers

  - Geographic location - where the user is (or was)

  - Employment history

  - Financial data - such as credit card numbers, salary, bank accounts, and debts

  - Pictures, video, or audio

  - Behavioral patterns - such as web surfing history, when certain activities are performed, etc.

  - Relationships (and types of relationships) with others - family, friends, contacts, etc.

  - Communications - e-mail addresses, private messages, text messages, chat logs, etc.

  - Health - medical conditions, insurance status, prescription records

  - Account passwords and other credentials

Some of this information may be characterized as PII (Personally Identifiable Information), Protected Health Information (PHI), etc. Categories of private information may overlap or vary based on the intended usage or the policies and practices of a particular industry.

Sometimes data that is not labeled as private can have a privacy implication in a different context. For example, student identification numbers are usually not considered private because there is no explicit and publicly-available mapping to an individual student's personal information. However, if a school generates identification numbers based on student social security numbers, then the identification numbers should be considered private.







## CWE-1272: Sensitive Information Uncleared Before Debug/Power State Transition
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs a power or debug state transition, but it does not clear sensitive information that should no longer be accessible due to changes to information access restrictions.

### Extended Description


A device or system frequently employs many power and sleep states during its normal operation (e.g., normal power, additional power, low power, hibernate, deep sleep, etc.). A device also may be operating within a debug condition. State transitions can happen from one power or debug state to another. If there is information available in the previous state which should not be available in the next state and is not properly removed before the transition into the next state, sensitive information may leak from the system.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-12926:** Product software does not set a flag as per TPM specifications, thereby preventing a failed authorization attempt from being recorded after a loss of power.




## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Marshaling, Unmarshaling: Marshaling and unmarshaling are effectively synonyms for serialization and deserialization, respectively.
Pickling, Unpickling: In Python, the "pickle" functionality is used to perform serialization and deserialization.
PHP Object Injection: Some PHP application researchers use this term when attacking unsafe use of the unserialize() function; but it is also used for CWE-915.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between CWE-502 and CWE-915 need further exploration. CWE-915 is more narrowly scoped to object modification, and is not necessarily used for deserialization.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-12799:** chain: bypass of untrusted deserialization issue (CWE-502) by using an assumed-trusted class (CWE-183)
- **CVE-2015-8103:** Deserialization issue in commonly-used Java library allows remote execution.
- **CVE-2015-4852:** Deserialization issue in commonly-used Java library allows remote execution.




## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

### Extended Description


Attackers may be able to bypass weak authentication faster and/or with less effort than expected.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).
- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
- **CVE-2021-3116:** Chain: Python-based HTTP Proxy server uses the wrong boolean operators (CWE-480) causing an incorrect comparison (CWE-697) that identifies an authN failure if all three conditions are met instead of only one, allowing bypass of the proxy authentication (CWE-1390)




## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction:** Base
