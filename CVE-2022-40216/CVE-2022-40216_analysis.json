CWE-862 is preferred over CWE-284 because it is more specific. CWE-862 is preferred over CWE-863 because the vulnerability description describes a **missing** authorization check, not an incorrect one. CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is a Class-level CWE that encompasses both missing and incorrect authorization, making it a less precise fit than CWE-862. The abstraction levels influenced the decision, as the goal was to choose the most specific CWE that accurately represents the weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|ChildOf| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check (CWE-862), which allows a user with subscriber privileges to bypass intended restrictions and access functionality meant for higher-privileged users. This leads to a **block bypass**, as stated in the vulnerability description.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, particularly the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" which indicates that the root cause of the vulnerability is a \"Broken Access Control\" issue due to a **missing authorization** check.\n\n> *   The vulnerability is due to a \"Broken Access Control\" issue within the BP Better Messages plugin. This indicates a **missing authorization**, authentication, or nonce token check in a function.\n\nThis statement strongly supports the selection of CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). The graph relationships further reinforce this decision, as CWE-862 is a child of the more general CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), providing a clear hierarchy of specificity. The selection of CWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the root cause described in the vulnerability report.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25
