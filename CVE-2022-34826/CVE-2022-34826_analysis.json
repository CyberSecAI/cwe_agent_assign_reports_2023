The primary CWE identified is CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File).\n\nThe selection of CWE-532 is strongly supported by:\n*   The **Vulnerability Description** states that \"an encrypted Private Key passphrase may be **leaked** in the logs\".\n*   The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** confirms this, stating the \"**root_cause**\" as \"Encrypted private key passphrase may be **leaked** in the logs.\" and \"**weaknesses**\" as \"Private key passphrase leakage\". It further identifies the \"**attack_vectors**\" as \"Log files.\"\n\nCWE-532's description perfectly matches this: \"The product writes sensitive information to a log file.\" The \"Mapping Guidance\" for CWE-532 indicates \"Usage: Allowed\" and provides a \"Rationale\" that \"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\" The observed examples for CWE-532 contain similar vulnerabilities related to logging credentials.\n\nThe other CWEs considered were not as good a fit:\n\n*   CWE-325 (Missing Cryptographic Step): While cryptography is involved, the core issue isn't a missing step, but the **improper** logging of data.\n*   CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials): This is a broader category, and CWE-532 is more specific to the logging context.\n*   CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data): The data is being written to a log file, not sent as data.\n*   CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key): This doesn't apply as the issue isn't a hard-coded key, but a **leaked** key passphrase.\n*   CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password): While the key is encrypted, the **leakage** of even the encrypted version is the problem.\n*   CWE-226 (Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse): This CWE applies when sensitive information is left in a resource after its release, which is not the case here.\n*   CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information): The key is encrypted, so this CWE doesn't directly apply.\n*   CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm): There's no indication of a broken algorithm.\n*   CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information): The **leakage** is not necessarily via an error message.\n\nTherefore, CWE-532 is the most accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
