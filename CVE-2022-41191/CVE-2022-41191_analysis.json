The description also mentions a \"stack-based overflow,\" which suggests CWE-121. CWE-416 is a variant of CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference), indicating a more specific type of pointer issue. CWE-121 is a child of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), implying a write operation exceeding buffer limits on the stack. CWE-787 is also a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) but we should avoid CWE-119 since it is discouraged.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe121 secondary\n    class cwe825,cwe787,cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with a **lack of proper memory management**, leading to either a **stack-based overflow or a re-use of dangling pointer**. If it is a stack-based overflow, then the chain is: Improper Memory Management -> Stack-based Buffer Overflow -> Remote Code Execution. If it is a re-use of a dangling pointer then the chain is: Improper Memory Management -> Use After Free -> Remote Code Execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the key phrases in the vulnerability description, primarily \"**lack of proper memory management**\" and \"**stack-based overflow or a re-use of dangling pointer**\".\n\nThe explicit mention of \"re-use of dangling pointer\" strongly suggests CWE-416 (Use After Free), while \"stack-based overflow\" points to CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow). The retriever results also list CWE-416 as a strong candidate.\n\nThe final decision is to map CWE-416 as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"re-use of dangling pointer\", which directly corresponds to the definition of CWE-416. CWE-121 is included as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability description mentions stack-based overflow as an alternative to a dangling pointer. These are at the optimal level of specificity (Variant) because they are directly derived from the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n##
