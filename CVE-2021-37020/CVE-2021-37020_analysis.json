CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is a `Base` level CWE and a `ChildOf` CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). The vulnerability description explicitly states a \"stack-based buffer overflow\" as the **weakness**, which is a more specific type of buffer overflow than a generic out-of-bounds write. The impact is stated as \"out-of-bounds read\". The chosen CWEs reflect the specific type of buffer overflow and its resulting impact.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe125,cwe119,cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **stack-based buffer overflow** (**weakness**), leading to the impact of an out-of-bounds read.\n- CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow (Root Cause)\n- CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-121 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of \"stack-based buffer overflow\" in the vulnerability description. The secondary weakness, CWE-125, was identified as the resulting impact. The retriever results and CWE specifications support this classification.\n\nThe vulnerability description key phrases clearly state the **weakness** as a \"stack-based buffer overflow\" and the \"impact\" as an out-of-bounds read. This information is directly used to select CWE-121 and CWE-125 respectively.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-121 is a more specific type of out-of-bounds write, making it a better fit than the more general CWE-787. CWE-125 accurately represents the resulting out-of-bounds read. These selections are at the optimal level of specificity, as they directly correspond to the vulnerability's described **weakness** and impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n- *Reason for not selecting*: The vulnerability description doesn't talk about buffer underwrite.
