CWE-425 is a child of CWE-862, Missing Authorization which is a Class level CWE. CWE-862 is considered as a secondary candidate, as the description indicates the product does not adequately enforce authorization.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe425 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check, leading to the attacker gaining unauthorized access to the admin dashboard, resulting in **privilege escalation**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified that the vulnerability description indicates a **privilege escalation** issue due to an attacker gaining access to the admin dashboard. Based on the provided evidence, the primary weakness is the **lack of proper authorization enforcement**, which aligns with CWE-425, Direct Request ('Forced Browsing'). The vulnerability description states that an attacker can get access to the admin dashboard, which suggests that the application **does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization**.\n\nThe retriever results show that CWE-425 is the top combined result.\nCWE-425 is a Base level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction.\nThe description of CWE-425 matches the vulnerability description: *\"The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\"*\n\nCWE-862, Missing Authorization, was considered as a secondary candidate because it is a more general case of the same problem.\n\nCWE-732, Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, was considered but not selected because the description indicates the program does not adequately enforce authorization.\nCWE-639, Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key, was considered but not selected because there is no evidence of modification of the key value identifying the data.\nCWE-269, Improper Privilege Management, was considered but discarded because it is too general and the description is closer to an authorization issue.\nCWE-472, External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter, was considered but discarded because there is no evidence of external control of assumed-immutable web parameters.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-425 providing a more specific description of the vulnerability compared to the higher-level CWE-862.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
