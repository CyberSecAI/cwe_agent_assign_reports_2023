CWE-416 is **ChildOf** CWE-825 (**Expired Pointer Dereference**), CWE-672 (**Operation on Resource after Expiration**), and CWE-672 (**Operation on Resource after Expiration**). CWE-416 can **CanPrecede** CWE-120 (**Buffer Copy without Checking Size**) and CWE-123 (**Write-What-Where Condition**). The secondary CWE is CWE-787 (**Out-of-bounds Write**), which is a base level CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource after Expiration\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n    \n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe416 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe120\n    cwe416 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe123\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **Use After Free** (CWE-416), which then leads to **heap corruption**. This **heap corruption** can cause an **Out-of-bounds Write** (CWE-787).\n  - The initial flaw is a **Use After Free**.\n  - This leads to **heap corruption**.\n  - This results in a potential **Out-of-bounds Write**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that there is a \"**use after free**\" in the New Tab Page in Google Chrome. The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** also states \"**rootcause:** **use after free**\" and \"**weakness:** **heap corruption**\". The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** confirms this with \"**root_cause:** Use after free\" and \"**weaknesses:** Use after free\".\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-416 (**Use After Free**) because the vulnerability description, key phrases, and CVE reference links all indicate a **use after free** condition. The retriever results also lists CWE-416 as the top combined result.\n\nThe secondary CWE is CWE-787 (**Out-of-bounds Write**) because the vulnerability description mentions \"**heap corruption**\" which can lead to an out-of-bounds write. The \"**heap corruption**\" occurs because of the \"**use after free**\".\n\nThe CWEs selected are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-416 is a variant and CWE-787 is a base.\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-366 (**Race Condition within a Thread**): While a race condition could potentially contribute to a use-after-free, there is no specific mention of a race condition in the provided description. Therefore, CWE-366 is not selected.\n*   CWE-122 (**Heap-based Buffer Overflow**): While heap corruption is mentioned, there's no explicit mention of a buffer overflow. Therefore, CWE-122 is not chosen as the primary CWE, although heap corruption could cause a buffer overflow.\n*   CWE-843 (**Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type**): There is no mention of incompatible types in the description, so this CWE is not selected.\n*   CWE-362 (**Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')**): Similar to CWE-366, there's no explicit evidence of a race condition.\n*   CWE-1022 (**Use of Web Link to Untrusted Target with window.opener Access**): This is specific to web links and is not relevant to the described vulnerability.\n*   CWE-364 (**Signal Handler Race Condition**): This is specific to signal handlers and is not relevant to the described vulnerability.\n*   CWE-415 (**Double Free**): While double free is related to memory management issues, the description specifically mentions use-after-free, making CWE-416 a more accurate fit.\n*   CWE-665 (**Improper Initialization**): Improper initialization is not mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n*   CWE-451 (**User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information**): The vulnerability is related to heap corruption and use-after-free, not UI misrepresentation.",
