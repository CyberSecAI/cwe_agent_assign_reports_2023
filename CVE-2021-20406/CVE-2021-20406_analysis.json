CWE-1240, a base-level CWE, is a ChildOf CWE-327 and focuses on risky implementations of cryptographic primitives. CWE-326 is another class-level CWE, also a child of CWE-693, focusing on inadequate encryption strength.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe1240[\"CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\"]\n    cwe326[\"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    \n    cwe1240 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    cwe327 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe326 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe327 primary\n    class cwe1240,cwe326 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of weak cryptographic algorithms** (CWE-327), which leads to the potential to **decrypt highly sensitive information**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description and key phrases, points to a cryptographic issue. The evidence provided explicitly mentions the use of **weak cryptographic algorithms** and a short JWT signing key. The Retriever Results also highlight CWE-327 as a strong candidate.\n\nThe final decision leans heavily on the evidence provided: \"The cryptographic algorithm used by IBM Security Verify Information Queue (ISIQ) to encrypt and decrypt application data uses a JSON web token (JWT) signing key that is shorter than the recommended length.\" This statement confirms the **use of a weak or risky cryptographic algorithm**, making CWE-327 the most appropriate primary classification.\n\nCWE-327 is a Class-level CWE, and the mapping guidance suggests examining its children for a better fit. CWE-1240, **Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation**, is a child of CWE-327 and focuses on the implementation aspect. However, the description doesn't explicitly state that the *implementation* is risky, only that the key is shorter than recommended. Therefore, CWE-327 is chosen as the primary CWE.\n\nCWE-1240 and CWE-326 are kept as secondary candidates due to the potential for a risky implementation or inadequate encryption strength, but the evidence is not strong enough to make them primary classifications.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity because they accurately reflect the root cause of the vulnerability without over-specifying the implementation details.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
