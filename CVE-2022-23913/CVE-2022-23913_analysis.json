CWE-400 is a more general class of weakness related to uncontrolled resource consumption, while CWE-770 is more specific, focusing on the allocation of resources without limits or throttling. Although CWE-770 is more specific, based on the vulnerability description and the MITRE mapping guidance, CWE-400 is the primary and most appropriate mapping.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n    class cwe789 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **uncontrolled resource consumption of memory** in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. This leads to a partial disruption of availability, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **uncontrolled resource consumption of memory**, which directly aligns with CWE-400. The vulnerability description key phrase, \"**uncontrolled resource consumption of memory**,\" strongly supports this classification. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further reinforces this, indicating the vulnerability leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) due to the described **weakness**.\n\nThe retriever results also point to CWE-400 as a strong candidate, though it is discouraged due to the availability of more specific child CWEs. CWE-770, Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling, is a child of CWE-400 and a strong secondary candidate. The description mentions that the product does not impose restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated. While this is implied, the primary issue is the uncontrolled consumption itself, making CWE-400 the more appropriate primary mapping.\n\nCWE-789, Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value, was considered but not chosen because the vulnerability isn't necessarily about an excessive size value, but rather the **uncontrolled consumption of memory**.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided evidence, CWE-400 is the most appropriate primary CWE, with CWE-770 as a secondary CWE representing a more specific aspect of the vulnerability. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-400 capturing the overall issue and CWE-770 providing additional context.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, i.e., after the resource is no longer needed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-834: Excessive Iteration\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an iteration or loop without sufficiently limiting the number of times that the loop is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

However, classification research is limited for weaknesses of this type, so there can be gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE that force use of this weakness, even at such a high level of abstraction.\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 6276.21\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level",
