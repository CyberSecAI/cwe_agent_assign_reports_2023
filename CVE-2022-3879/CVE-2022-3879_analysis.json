CWE-352, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), is a compound weakness that requires several other weaknesses to be present, including CWE-346, CWE-441, CWE-642, and CWE-613. CWE-352 can be preceded by CWE-1275 (Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute). The abstraction levels influenced the decision to choose CWE-862 over its parents, as it provides a more specific classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    cwe346[\"CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\"]\n    cwe441[\"CWE-441: Unintended Proxy or Intermediary ('Confused Deputy')\"]\n    cwe642[\"CWE-642: External Control of Critical State Data\"]\n    cwe613[\"CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\"]\n    cwe1275[\"CWE-1275: Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|ChildOf| cwe284\n    cwe352 -->|ChildOf| cwe345\n    cwe352 -->|Requires| cwe346\n    cwe352 -->|Requires| cwe441\n    cwe352 -->|Requires| cwe642\n    cwe352 -->|Requires| cwe613\n    cwe1275 -->|CanPrecede| cwe352\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe352 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284,cwe345,cwe346,cwe441,cwe642,cwe613,cwe1275 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper authorization** (CWE-862) and **lack of CSRF protection** (CWE-352) in an AJAX action. This allows any authenticated user, including subscribers, to call the action and install arbitrary plugins, potentially leading to full site control.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which includes the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The primary **root cause** is the **lack of proper authorization** in the AJAX action, allowing low-privileged users to install plugins. The secondary weakness is the **missing CSRF protection**, which could allow an attacker to trick a user into making the request.\n\nThe graph relationships show how CWE-862 is a child of more general authorization-related CWEs, but is more specific and appropriate for this case. CWE-352 is a compound weakness that requires several other weaknesses to be present.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the **root causes** identified in the vulnerability description: **missing authorization** and **missing CSRF protection**. CWE-862 accurately describes the **lack of authorization** checks, while CWE-352 describes the **absence of CSRF protection**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
