Its child CWE, CWE-367, represents a specific type of race condition. The decision to choose CWE-362 as the primary weakness is based on the description that the **improper integrity check** leads to a general **race condition** between tasks. CWE-367 is a more specific TOCTOU race condition, which wasn't clearly supported by the evidence. CWE-390 was considered because the **improper integrity check** could be interpreted as detecting an error condition without taking proper action, contributing to the race condition.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe390[\"CWE-390: Detection of Error Condition Without Action\"]\n    cwe755[\"CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    \n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    cwe390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe755\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe367 secondary\n    class cwe390,cwe755 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **improper integrity check**, which leads to a **race condition** between tasks.\n\nImproper Integrity Check -> Race Condition\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and weakness in the vulnerability description. The key phrases \"**improper integrity check**\" and \"**race condition**\" were crucial in narrowing down the potential CWEs. The retriever results strongly suggested CWE-362 as the primary candidate.
