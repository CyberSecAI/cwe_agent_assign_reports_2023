This is a base-level CWE, providing a good level of specificity. **CWE-805** is a child of **CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer)**. The vulnerability description key phrases and CVE Reference Links Content Summary mention buffer overflow due to **lack of proper length checks on the incoming HCI data** which maps well with **CWE-805**. The secondary weakness, **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)**, could be a consequence of incorrect length value leading to reading beyond buffer boundaries.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe805[\"CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    \n    cwe805 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe805 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe125 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper validation of the length** of incoming HCI data, leading to **buffer access with an incorrect length value**, which results in a **buffer overflow** and **memory corruption**, potentially allowing for **arbitrary code execution.**\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment aligns well with the provided evidence and the retriever results. The **Vulnerability Description** clearly states \"**Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value** in zephyr.\" The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** confirms that the **root cause of vulnerability** is that the Zephyr Bluetooth protocol stack **does not properly validate the length of incoming HCI data** when setting `SCAN_RSP` through the HCI command which confirms the incorrect length issue. The reference also states that \"**A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper length checks on the incoming HCI data**\" and that \"**An attacker can cause memory overflow leading to memory overwrite, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution**\".\n\nThe graph relationships support the selection of **CWE-805** as the primary CWE, given its direct connection to the **improper buffer access** due to incorrect length. Other considered CWEs like **CWE-130 (Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency)** and **CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input)** were less specific to the buffer access itself, focusing more on the parameter handling and validation aspects, respectively. Therefore, **CWE-805** is the most specific and appropriate CWE for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: N/A\n**Source**: N/A\n\n**Description**:\nThe software performs an operation that can read or write to a memory buffer, but it does not properly restrict the operation to prevent reading or writing to memory locations outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: N/A\n**Source**: N/A\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.",
