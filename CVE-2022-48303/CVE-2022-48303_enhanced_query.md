# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-48303

# Vulnerability Description

    GNU Tar through 1.34 has a one-byte **out-of-bounds read** that results in use of **uninitialized memory** for a conditional jump. Exploitation to change the flow of control has not been demonstrated. The issue occurs in from_header in list.c via a V7 archive in which mtime has approximately 11 whitespace characters.
