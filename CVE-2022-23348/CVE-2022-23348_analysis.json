CWE-328 and CWE-327 were also considered because of their parent relationship with CWE-916. CWE-798 was considered because it could be related to the use of weak credentials.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe328\n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe916 primary\n    class cwe328,cwe327,cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of weak password hashes** (CWE-916/CWE-328), leading to potential unauthorized access and full system compromise. The chain also includes improper access control, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the provided evidence, indicates that the BigAnt Server v5.6.06 utilizes **weak password hashes**, specifically MD5. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating that \"Passwords for the service admin and user accounts are stored as MD5 hashes, which are easily crackable.\" This aligns directly with CWE-916 \"Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\", which describes a scenario where the product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\nThe selection of CWE-916 is further supported by the Retriever Results, where it is ranked as the top combined result. The mapping guidance for CWE-916 states that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level.\n\nCWE-328 \"Use of Weak Hash\" was also considered because MD5 is a **weak hash** algorithm. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states, \"The primary vulnerability stems from the use of **weak password hashing** algorithms (MD5) and improper access controls within the BigAnt Server application.\" This indicates that the use of MD5 as a hashing algorithm is a contributing factor to the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-798 \"Use of Hard-coded Credentials\" was considered because the CVE Reference Links Content Summary mentioned \"Default UltraVNC Client: The installation includes a default UltraVNC client that can be used to connect to other clients if the service is running. The password for this client is the same for all clients and is encrypted, but can be cracked.\" Even though it's not the primary cause, it contributes to overall **weakness**.\n\nThe evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-916 as the primary CWE, with CWE-328 and CWE-798 as secondary contributing factors.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following
