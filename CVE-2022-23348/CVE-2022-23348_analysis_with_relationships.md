# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-916 | Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-916, which is a Base level CWE and a child of CWE-328 and CWE-327. CWE-328 and CWE-327 were also considered because of their parent relationship with CWE-916. CWE-798 was considered because it could be related to the use of weak credentials.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **use of weak password hashes** (CWE-916/CWE-328), leading to potential unauthorized access and full system compromise. The chain also includes improper access control, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment, based on the provided evidence, indicates that the BigAnt Server v5.6.06 utilizes **weak password hashes**, specifically MD5. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating that "Passwords for the service admin and user accounts are stored as MD5 hashes, which are easily crackable." This aligns directly with CWE-916 "Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort", which describes a scenario where the product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

The selection of CWE-916 is further supported by the Retriever Results, where it is ranked as the top combined result. The mapping guidance for CWE-916 states that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level.

CWE-328 "Use of Weak Hash" was also considered because MD5 is a **weak hash** algorithm. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states, "The primary vulnerability stems from the use of **weak password hashing** algorithms (MD5) and improper access controls within the BigAnt Server application." This indicates that the use of MD5 as a hashing algorithm is a contributing factor to the vulnerability.

CWE-798 "Use of Hard-coded Credentials" was considered because the CVE Reference Links Content Summary mentioned "Default UltraVNC Client: The installation includes a default UltraVNC client that can be used to connect to other clients if the service is running. The password for this client is the same for all clients and is encrypted, but can be cracked." Even though it's not the primary cause, it contributes to overall **weakness**.

The evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-916 as the primary CWE, with CWE-328 and CWE-798 as secondary contributing factors.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
