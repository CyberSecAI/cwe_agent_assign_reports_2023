The relationship analysis influenced the selection by identifying the need for both CSRF and authorization checks.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe346[\"CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\"]\n    cwe441[\"CWE-441: Unintended Proxy or Intermediary\"]\n    cwe642[\"CWE-642: External Control of Critical State Data\"]\n    cwe613[\"CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\"]\n\n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe346\n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe441\n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe642\n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe613\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284,cwe346,cwe441,cwe642,cwe613 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of root cause and weaknesses is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing authorization and CSRF check** in AJAX actions.\n2.  **Weakness:** Any logged-in user can call these AJAX actions.\n3.  **Impact:** Disable the app.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states the **missing authorisation and CSRF check** in AJAX actions, which allows any logged-in user to disable the app.\nThe vulnerability description key phrases also highlight the **missing authorisation and CSRF check** as the **rootcause**.
