The vulnerability stems from a **missing permission check**, which directly relates to authorization. Therefore, CWE-862 is a secondary contributing factor.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission check** (CWE-862), leading to the possibility of AT **command injection** (CWE-78), ultimately resulting in local privilege escalation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary root cause is the **command injection** vulnerability (CWE-78) due to a **missing permission check** (CWE-862). The description states that there is a missing permission check which allows AT command injection, leading to local escalation of privilege.\n\nThe analysis is based on the following evidence:\n*   Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: \"**missing permission check**\", \"**command injection**\", \"local escalation of privilege\"\n*   CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"The vulnerability stems from a missing permission check in the ims service, which allows for potential AT command injection.\", \"Missing authorization (CWE-862), leading to a vulnerability where an attacker can inject AT commands.\", \"Local escalation of privilege without requiring additional execution privileges or user interaction.\",\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the connection between command injection and missing authorization.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-78 is a base-level CWE that accurately describes the command injection vulnerability, and CWE-862 is a class-level CWE that captures the missing authorization aspect.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This CWE was considered, but it is not relevant to the vulnerability description.*\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
