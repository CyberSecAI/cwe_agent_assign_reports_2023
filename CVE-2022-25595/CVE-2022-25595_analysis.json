While CWE-400 is discouraged, it is the best fit for the described impact (denial of service). CWE-1284 and CWE-20 are related to input validation, which is a potential root cause. CWE-1284 is a child of CWE-20, making it more specific.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n\n    cwe400 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664\n    cwe1284 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe400 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe1284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe20,cwe1284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper user request handling**, potentially caused by **improper input validation** (CWE-20) or, more specifically, **improper validation of specified quantity in input** (CWE-1284). This leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400), resulting in a **denial of service**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitial analysis considered **improper user request handling** as the root cause leading to **denial of service**. The evidence indicates that the ASUS RT-AC86U router does not properly handle user requests, allowing an unauthenticated LAN attacker to cause a DoS. This is supported by the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" which mentions \"**improper input validation**\" and crafted messages triggering service disruption.\n\nThe retriever results suggest several CWEs, including CWE-791, CWE-130, CWE-703, CWE-941, CWE-230, CWE-77, CWE-184, CWE-20, CWE-400, and CWE-1284. While several of these are related to input handling, CWE-400 directly addresses the consequence of uncontrolled resource consumption leading to DoS, and is thus selected as the primary CWE despite it being discouraged and a Class instead of Base.\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) and CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) are considered as secondary CWEs because the root cause is likely related to how the router validates incoming requests, but the description does not give enough information to support this with high confidence.\n\nCWE-400 is chosen because it is the most direct representation of the vulnerability's impact. While CWE-400 is discouraged, the description explicitly mentions a denial-of-service condition caused by **improper user request handling**. The selection of CWE-400 is further supported by the \"Impact of exploitation\" section in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" which states, \"A successful attack results in a **denial of service** (DoS), causing the system to become unavailable.\"\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not

authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives a complex input with multiple elements or fields that must be consistent with each other, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually consistent.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or

have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage:

Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-606: Unchecked Input for Loop Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity
