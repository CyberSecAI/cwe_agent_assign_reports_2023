CWE-1284 is a child of CWE-20 and represents a more specific case of improper input validation, namely the validation of specified quantities. The relationship is hierarchical, with CWE-1284 being a more specific instance of the general **improper input validation**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    \n    cwe1284 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe1284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper input validation check logic** (CWE-20), leading to a crash.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-20 as the primary weakness due to the **improper input validation check logic** being the root cause. The Retriever Results also listed CWE-20 as a candidate. However, CWE-20 is a Class-level CWE and the description mentions \"quantity\", suggesting that CWE-1284 could be a better fit.\n\nThe final decision is to use CWE-20 as the primary weakness and CWE-1284 as a secondary weakness.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision comes directly from the Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: \"**rootcause:** **Improper input validation check logic**\".\n\nCWE-20 is selected as the primary because the description explicitly states **\"Improper input validation check logic\"**.\n\nCWE-1284 is considered as a secondary weakness because \"**Improper input validation check logic**\" could potentially involve a quantity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
