We considered CWE-200, but it is a Class-level CWE and is often misused when a more specific CWE is available. CWE-203 provides a better fit because the vulnerability involves side-channel information disclosure, meaning the attacker observes differences in behavior to infer information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe203[\"CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe203 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe203 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **side channel information disclosure** (**WEAKNESS**) which allows an attacker to determine whether an app is installed, leading to local information disclosure (**IMPACT**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions \"**side channel information disclosure**\".\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"In AppSearchManagerService, there is a possible way to determine whether an app is installed, without query permissions, due to **side channel information disclosure**. This could lead to local information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed.\"\n\nThis statement directly points to CWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy), as side-channel attacks often rely on observing discrepancies in behavior to infer sensitive information. The description aligns well with CWE-203's description: \"The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\"\n\nCWE-203 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was considered but deemed less specific. While the vulnerability does lead to information disclosure, the root cause is the **observable discrepancy** that enables the inference of whether an app is installed. CWE-200 is also discouraged as a primary mapping.\n\nTherefore, CWE-203 is the most appropriate and specific CWE for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
