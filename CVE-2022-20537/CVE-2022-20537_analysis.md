# Analysis for CVE-2022-20537

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 1 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE |
| CWE-732 | Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource | 0.5 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-862 **Missing Authorization**, which is a class-level CWE. It has child relationships to CWE-285 and CWE-284. CWE-732 **Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource** is a class-level CWE and a possible alternative, but the description leans more towards a missing check rather than an incorrect assignment. Both are related to access control issues, but CWE-862 directly addresses the **missing permission check** mentioned in the vulnerability description.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission check** (CWE-862), which allows a Guest user to enable location-sensitive settings, leading to a local escalation of privilege.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified the **missing permission check** as the root cause of the vulnerability, which directly corresponds to CWE-862 **Missing Authorization**. The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference links clearly supports this classification.

The vulnerability description states: "In createDialog of WifiScanModeActivity.java, there is a possible way for a Guest user to enable location-sensitive settings due to a **missing permission check**."

The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this: "The fix for this vulnerability involves restricting the `WifiScanModeActivity` so that it is not shown if the user is a guest user. This is done by checking the user type before allowing access to the activity."

CWE-732 **Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource** was considered because it also relates to access control. However, the problem isn't that the permissions were incorrectly assigned, but that they weren't checked at all for Guest users. Therefore, CWE-862 is the more accurate and specific classification.

The selected CWE is at the Class level because a more specific Base or Variant was not available given the provided information.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected*: This vulnerability is not related to resource management.

## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected*: While there is a **missing check**, it is specifically related to authorization, making CWE-862 a better fit.

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected*: This vulnerability is not related to locking mechanisms.

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This vulnerability is not related to the validation of unsafe equivalence in input.

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This vulnerability is not related to the reuse of resources.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

*Not Selected*: While the guest user is gaining access to settings they shouldn't have, CWE-862 is a more precise description of the root cause.

## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This vulnerability is not related to return values.

## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: The core issue is not the *handling* of insufficient privileges, but the *missing check* for the required permissions.

## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.

*Not Selected*: Too high-level.

## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.
