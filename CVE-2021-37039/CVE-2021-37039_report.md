## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.8 | Class | Primary | Discouraged |
| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-20, which is a class-level CWE. While it's generally discouraged to map to class-level CWEs, the available information points to a general lack of input validation. A more specific base-level CWE that relates to the quantity could be present, hence the inclusion of CWE-1284. CWE-20 is a parent of CWE-1284.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20), which leads to a Bluetooth Denial of Service (DoS). The specific type of input is unknown, but is suspected to be quantity-related.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis points to a general input validation issue within the Huawei Smartphone's Bluetooth functionality. The key phrase "**Input verification vulnerability**" suggests a **lack of proper input validation**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating that the "**vulnerability stems from inadequate input validation**".

The Retriever Results list CWE-119, CWE-248, CWE-131, and CWE-20. However, the description and summary strongly suggest that the root cause is related to input validation.

CWE-20 is a Class-level CWE and mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available. However, given the limited information, it is a reasonable starting point. CWE-1284 is being considered as a secondary CWE.

The selection of CWE-20 is based on the provided evidence of "**Input verification vulnerability**" from both the Vulnerability Description Key Phrases and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. While a more specific CWE could be identified with additional information, CWE-20 accurately reflects the general nature of the weakness.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
When converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values. If the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur.

## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.

## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.

## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Truncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.

## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 6709.71
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 6603.94
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 6583.53
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.

## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 6447.13
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 6214.67
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
Truncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: base
**Similarity Score**: 5.03
**Source**: graph

**Description**:
CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence

## CWE-195: Signed to Unsigned Conversion Error
**Abstraction Level**: variant
**Similarity Score**: 4.53
**Source**: graph

**Description**:
CWE-195: Signed to Unsigned Conversion Error

## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write
**Abstraction Level**: base
**Similarity Score**: 4.33
