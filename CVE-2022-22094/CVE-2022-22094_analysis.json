While the description directly mentions a \"**race condition**,\" it's important to examine potential consequences and related weaknesses.\n\nCWE-362 is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate.\nCWE-362 can precede CWE-416 (Use After Free) and CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference). The description states \"memory corruption,\" suggesting a potential consequence of the **race condition**. This leads to consideration of memory corruption-related CWEs.\nCWE-416 (Use After Free) and CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) are considered as secondary issues, as they are possible outcomes of the **race condition** that results in memory corruption.\nThese relationships are visualized below:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe416 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe787\n    cwe362 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe416\n    cwe362 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe416,cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition** (CWE-362) in the Kernel. This **race condition** while getting mapping reference can lead to memory corruption. The memory corruption could manifest as a use-after-free (CWE-416) or out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the explicitly stated \"**race condition**\" and the resulting \"memory corruption.\" The retriever results strongly suggested CWE-362, which aligns well with the vulnerability description.\n\nThe key evidence is the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section, which lists \"**race condition**\" as the root cause. The term \"memory corruption\" indicates a likely impact, which could be further specified by CWE-416 or CWE-787 depending on the specific mechanism of corruption.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection of secondary CWEs, considering potential consequences of the **race condition**. While other CWEs were considered, they did not directly address the identified root cause as effectively as CWE-362, or the potential consequences as effectively as CWE-416 and CWE-787.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity: CWE-362 is a Class, but the provided information does not allow to select a more specific Base. CWE-416 and CWE-787 are both variant and base level respectively that describe the memory corruption issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
