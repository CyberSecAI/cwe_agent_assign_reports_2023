# Analysis for CVE-2022-27217

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-256 | Plaintext Storage of a Password | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-260 | Password in Configuration File | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-256, which is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-522. CWE-522 is a class-level CWE, indicating a more general weakness. Because the description specifically mentions the **plaintext storage of passwords**, CWE-256 is a more precise fit. CWE-260 is also a child of CWE-522 and represents a password stored in a configuration file. It is relevant because of the config.xml file mentioned in the description.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with the **unencrypted storage of passwords** (CWE-256) in the `config.xml` file. This allows users with `Extended Read` permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system to view the passwords, leading to potential unauthorized access or other security breaches.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly indicates that the root cause is the **unencrypted storage of passwords** in job `config.xml` files. This aligns directly with CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password), which is a Base level CWE. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section states: "The Vmware vRealize CodeStream Plugin stores passwords unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration", and "Passwords are stored in plain text."
The retriever results also list CWE-256 as the top combined result.

CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is a broader category, and while relevant, CWE-256 is a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability. CWE-260 (Password in Configuration File) is also relevant given the mention of the `config.xml` file.

The final decision to select CWE-256 as the primary CWE is based on the direct evidence of **plaintext password storage**, the retriever results, and the MITRE mapping guidance favoring Base-level CWEs when appropriate.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.

### Extended Description
Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.


Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.


When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to "sniff" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.
