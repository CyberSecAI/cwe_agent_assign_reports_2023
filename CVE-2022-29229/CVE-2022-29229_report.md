# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2022-29229

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-325 | Missing Cryptographic Step | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-327 | Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm | 0.5 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-325, which is a Base level CWE. It is a child of CWE-573 (Missing a Critical Step in a Security Process) and is peer of CWE-358 (Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard). CWE-327 is a Class level CWE and parent of CWE-325. The vulnerability description clearly indicates a missing step rather than a broken algorithm, making CWE-325 more appropriate.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **missing cryptographic step** (CWE-325) which leads to the impact of a server administrator gaining access to accounts' cryptographic keys.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified CWE-325 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of a "**missing cryptographic step**" in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. This is the root cause of the vulnerability. The retriever results also list CWE-325 as the top candidate. The analysis considered that the impact of gaining access to keys is possible because of the **missing** step. Therefore, CWE-325 is at the optimal level of specificity and has the highest confidence.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-325: Missing Cryptographic Step
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not implement a required step in a cryptographic algorithm, resulting in weaker encryption than advertised by the algorithm.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-573
PeerOf -> CWE-358

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use

## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.

### Extended Description


Cryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.

# CWE Details

## CWE-325: Missing Cryptographic Step
*   **How the vulnerability's details match the CWE's characteristics:** The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**missing cryptographic step**" as the root cause, which perfectly aligns with the CWE-325 description: "The product does not implement a required step in a cryptographic algorithm."
*   **The security implications and potential impact:** The security implication is the exposure of cryptographic keys to the server administrator, compromising the confidentiality and integrity of user accounts relying on end-to-end cryptographic security.
*   **Any parent-child relationships or chain patterns that influenced your mapping:** CWE-325 is a child of CWE-573 (Missing a Critical Step in a Security Process), indicating that it's a specific type of missing step related to cryptography.
*   **Whether the weakness is primary or secondary in the vulnerability:** CWE-325 is the primary weakness as it's the direct cause of the vulnerability.
*   **How the official MITRE mapping guidance influenced your decision:** The MITRE mapping guidance recommends using Base-level CWEs when appropriate, and CWE-325 is a Base-level CWE that accurately describes the vulnerability.

## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
*   **How the vulnerability's details DON'T match the CWE's characteristics:** The vulnerability is not about using a broken algorithm but about **missing** a necessary step.
*   **Why it was still considered:** While the core issue is a **missing step**, the result is a weakened cryptographic process, which could be argued to be a "risky cryptographic algorithm" in practice.
*   **Relationship to primary CWE:** CWE-327 is a parent (class) of CWE-325, meaning that a **missing step** is one way to have a broken cryptographic algorithm.
*   **Justification for not using:** The description focuses on a process that's missing something it requires.
