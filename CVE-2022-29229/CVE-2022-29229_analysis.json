It is a child of CWE-573 (Missing a Critical Step in a Security Process) and is peer of CWE-358 (Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard). CWE-327 is a Class level CWE and parent of CWE-325. The vulnerability description clearly indicates a missing step rather than a broken algorithm, making CWE-325 more appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe325[\"CWE-325: Missing Cryptographic Step\"]\n    cwe573[\"CWE-573: Missing a Critical Step in a Security Process\"]\n    cwe358[\"CWE-358: Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    \n    cwe325 -->|CHILDOF| cwe573\n    cwe325 --|PEEROF| cwe358\n    cwe325 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe325 primary\n    class cwe573,cwe358,cwe327 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing cryptographic step** (CWE-325) which leads to the impact of a server administrator gaining access to accounts' cryptographic keys.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-325 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of a \"**missing cryptographic step**\" in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. This is the root cause of the vulnerability. The retriever results also list CWE-325 as the top candidate. The analysis considered that the impact of gaining access to keys is possible because of the **missing** step. Therefore, CWE-325 is at the optimal level of specificity and has the highest confidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-325: Missing Cryptographic Step\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not implement a required step in a cryptographic algorithm, resulting in weaker encryption than advertised by the algorithm.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-573\nPeerOf -> CWE-358\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
