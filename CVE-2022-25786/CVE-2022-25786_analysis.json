CWE-1299 **Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface** is a child of CWE-420, making it a more specific case of an unprotected alternate channel, particularly in hardware contexts. This relationship influenced the decision to consider CWE-1299 as a secondary candidate, although the description does not explicitly mention hardware.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe420[\"CWE-420: Unprotected Alternate Channel\"]\n    cwe1299[\"CWE-1299: Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface\"]\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n    cwe923[\"CWE-923: Improper Isolation of System Resources\"]\n    \n    cwe1299 -->|ChildOf| cwe420\n    cwe1299 -->|ChildOf| cwe288\n    cwe420 -->|ChildOf| cwe923\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe420 primary\n    class cwe1299 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **unprotected alternate channel** (CWE-420), which leads to a system administrator being able to obtain sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly indicates CWE-420 **Unprotected Alternate Channel** as the primary weakness, based on the phrase \"**unprotected alternate channel**\" in the vulnerability description. The Retriever Results also list CWE-420 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-1299 **Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface** was considered as a possible match because it is a child of CWE-420 and is related to hardware interfaces. However, the vulnerability description does not specifically mention any hardware interface, so the confidence for CWE-1299 is lower.\n\nThe final decision is to assign CWE-420 as the primary CWE because it directly reflects the root cause described in the vulnerability, with CWE-1299 as a secondary candidate. This selection provides an optimal level of specificity while remaining well-supported by the evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1299: Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe lack of protections on alternate paths to access\n                control-protected assets (such as unprotected shadow registers\n                and other external facing unguarded interfaces) allows an\n                attacker to bypass existing protections to the asset that are\n\t\tonly performed against the primary path.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-205: Observable Behavioral Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product's behaviors indicate important differences that may be observed by unauthorized actors in a way that reveals (1) its internal state or decision process, or (2) differences from other products with equivalent functionality.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTwo separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-420: Unprotected Alternate Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product protects a primary channel, but it does not use the same level of protection for an alternate channel.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
