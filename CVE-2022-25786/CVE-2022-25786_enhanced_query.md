# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-420: Unprotected Alternate Channel
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product protects a primary channel, but it does not use the same level of protection for an alternate channel.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-923

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be primary to authentication errors, and resultant from unhandled error conditions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-8004:** When the internal flash is protected by blocking access on the Data Bus (DBUS), it can still be indirectly accessed through the Instruction Bus (IBUS).
- **CVE-2002-0567:** DB server assumes that local clients have performed authentication, allowing attacker to directly connect to a process to load libraries and execute commands; a socket interface also exists (another alternate channel), so attack can be remote.
- **CVE-2002-1578:** Product does not restrict access to underlying database, so attacker can bypass restrictions by directly querying the database.




## CWE-779: Logging of Excessive Data
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product logs too much information, making log files hard to process and possibly hindering recovery efforts or forensic analysis after an attack.

### Extended Description
While logging is a good practice in general, and very high levels of logging are appropriate for debugging stages of development, too much logging in a production environment might hinder a system administrator's ability to detect anomalous conditions. This can provide cover for an attacker while attempting to penetrate a system, clutter the audit trail for forensic analysis, or make it more difficult to debug problems in a production environment.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-400

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2007-0421:** server records a large amount of data to the server log when it receives malformed headers
- **CVE-2002-1154:** chain: application does not restrict access to front-end for updates, which allows attacker to fill the error log




## CWE-459: Incomplete Cleanup
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly "clean up" and remove temporary or supporting resources after they have been used.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Insufficient Cleanup

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-404
ChildOf -> CWE-404

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** CWE-459 is a child of CWE-404 because, while CWE-404 covers any type of improper shutdown or release of a resource, CWE-459 deals specifically with a multi-step shutdown process in which a crucial step for "proper" cleanup is omitted or impossible. That is, CWE-459 deals specifically with a cleanup or shutdown process that does not successfully remove all potentially sensitive data.

**[Relationship]** Overlaps other categories such as permissions and containment. Concept needs further development. This could be primary (e.g. leading to infoleak) or resultant (e.g. resulting from unhandled error conditions or early termination).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2000-0552:** World-readable temporary file not deleted after use.
- **CVE-2005-2293:** Temporary file not deleted after use, leaking database usernames and passwords.
- **CVE-2002-0788:** Interaction error creates a temporary file that can not be deleted due to strong permissions.




## CWE-1299: Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The lack of protections on alternate paths to access
                control-protected assets (such as unprotected shadow registers
                and other external facing unguarded interfaces) allows an
                attacker to bypass existing protections to the asset that are
		only performed against the primary path.

### Extended Description


An asset inside a chip might have access-control protections through one interface. However, if all paths to the asset are not protected, an attacker might compromise the asset through alternate paths. These alternate paths could be through shadow or mirror registers inside the IP core, or could be paths from other external-facing interfaces to the IP core or SoC.


Consider an SoC with various interfaces such as UART, SMBUS, PCIe, USB, etc. If access control is implemented for SoC internal registers only over the PCIe interface, then an attacker could still modify the SoC internal registers through alternate paths by coming through interfaces such as UART, SMBUS, USB, etc. 


Alternatively, attackers might be able to bypass existing protections by exploiting unprotected, shadow registers. Shadow registers and mirror registers typically refer to registers that can be accessed from multiple addresses. Writing to or reading from the aliased/mirrored address has the same effect as writing to the address of the main register. They are typically implemented within an IP core or SoC to temporarily hold certain data. These data will later be updated to the main register, and both registers will be in synch. If the shadow registers are not access-protected, attackers could simply initiate transactions to the shadow registers and compromise system security.

## CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The web application uses the HTTP GET method to process a request and includes sensitive information in the query string of that request.

### Extended Description
The query string for the URL could be saved in the browser's history, passed through Referers to other web sites, stored in web logs, or otherwise recorded in other sources. If the query string contains sensitive information such as session identifiers, then attackers can use this information to launch further attacks.

## CWE-1295: Debug Messages Revealing Unnecessary Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product fails to adequately prevent the revealing of unnecessary and potentially sensitive system information within debugging messages.

### Extended Description


Debug messages are messages that help troubleshoot an issue by revealing the internal state of the system. For example, debug data in design can be exposed through internal memory array dumps or boot logs through interfaces like UART via TAP commands, scan chain, etc. Thus, the more information contained in a debug message, the easier it is to debug. However, there is also the risk of revealing information that could help an attacker either decipher a vulnerability, and/or gain a better understanding of the system. Thus, this extra information could lower the "security by obscurity" factor. While "security by obscurity" alone is insufficient, it can help as a part of "Defense-in-depth". 


### Alternative Terms

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** overlaps Unprotected Alternate Channel



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2000-1179:** Router allows remote attackers to read system logs without authentication by directly connecting to the login screen and typing certain control characters.
- **CVE-1999-1454:** Attackers with physical access to the machine may bypass the password prompt by pressing the ESC (Escape) key.
- **CVE-1999-1077:** OS allows local attackers to bypass the password protection of idled sessions via the programmer's switch or CMD-PWR keyboard sequence, which brings up a debugger that the attacker can use to disable the lock.




## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-755
ChildOf -> CWE-269
PeerOf -> CWE-271
CanAlsoBe -> CWE-280

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.
**Comments:** See maintenance notes.
**Reasons:**
- Potential Deprecation
- CWE Overlap


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** CWE-280 and CWE-274 are too similar. It is likely that CWE-274 will be deprecated in the future.

**[Relationship]** Overlaps dropped privileges, insufficient permissions.

**[Theoretical]** This has a layering relationship with Unchecked Error Condition and Unchecked Return Value.

**[Theoretical]** Within the context of vulnerability theory, privileges and permissions are two sides of the same coin. Privileges are associated with actors, and permissions are associated with resources. To perform access control, at some point the product makes a decision about whether the actor (and the privileges that have been assigned to that actor) is allowed to access the resource (based on the permissions that have been specified for that resource).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-1564:** System limits are not properly enforced after privileges are dropped.
- **CVE-2005-3286:** Firewall crashes when it can't read a critical memory block that was protected by a malicious process.
- **CVE-2005-1641:** Does not give admin sufficient privileges to overcome otherwise legitimate user actions.




## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

### Extended Description
Discrepancies can take many forms, and variations may be detectable in timing, control flow, communications such as replies or requests, or general behavior. These discrepancies can reveal information about the product's operation or internal state to an unauthorized actor. In some cases, discrepancies can be used by attackers to form a side channel.

### Alternative Terms
Side Channel Attack: Observable Discrepancies are at the root of side channel attacks.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-200
ChildOf -> CWE-200

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-8695:** Observable discrepancy in the RAPL interface for some Intel processors allows information disclosure.
- **CVE-2019-14353:** Crypto hardware wallet's power consumption relates to total number of pixels illuminated, creating a side channel in the USB connection that allows attackers to determine secrets displayed such as PIN numbers and passwords
- **CVE-2019-10071:** Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies
