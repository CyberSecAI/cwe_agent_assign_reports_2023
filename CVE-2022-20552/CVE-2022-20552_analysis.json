CWE-416 can precede CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input) or CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition).

The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this with \"Root cause of vulnerability: Heap use-after-free\" and \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Use-after-free\". The impact is information disclosure.\n\nCWE-416 (Use After Free) is selected as the primary CWE because it is the **rootcause** of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description key phrases also identify \"**rootcause:** **use after free**\". The Retriever Results also list CWE-416 as the fifth best match. The usage is \"Allowed\" and the Abstraction level is \"Variant\".\n\nCWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is selected as a secondary CWE because it is the **weakness** that results from the **use after free**. The vulnerability description states \"**weakness:** **out of bounds read**\".\n\nCWE-908 (Use of Uninitialized Resource) was considered because it was the top result in the Retriever Results. However, the provided evidence strongly points to a **use after free** rather than use of an uninitialized resource. Therefore, CWE-908 was not selected.\n\nCWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')) was considered because it was the second result in the Retriever Results and because CWE-362 can precede CWE-416. However, there is no mention of concurrency or synchronization issues in the vulnerability description or CVE Reference Links Content Summary. Therefore, CWE-362 was not selected.",
