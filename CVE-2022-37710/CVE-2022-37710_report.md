## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-321 | Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the ChildOf relationship between CWE-321 and CWE-798. CWE-321 is a variant of CWE-798, indicating it's a more specific case of using hard-coded credentials, focusing specifically on cryptographic keys. Given the vulnerability description explicitly mentions hard-coded encryption keys, CWE-321 is the more appropriate choice.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is straightforward:
1.  **Root Cause:** Hard-coded encryption keys and salt (CWE-321)
2.  **Impact:** Potential compromise of encrypted data due to the exposure of cryptographic keys.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions that the encryption keys and salt are **hardcoded**. The description, "Applicable files are encrypted with keys and salt that are **hardcoded** into a DLL or EXE file," provides direct evidence for selecting CWE-321.

CWE-321, "Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key," is a Variant level CWE and a child of CWE-798, "Use of Hard-coded Credentials." While CWE-798 could be considered, CWE-321 is more specific and accurately captures the nature of the vulnerability. The MITRE mapping guidance allows for the use of Variant level CWEs when they are a suitable fit.

CWE-327 "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm" was considered because the description mentions AES-256 encryption, and it's possible for the *implementation* of a crypto algorithm to be weak. However, the root cause is not a broken algorithm, but the use of a **hardcoded** key.

CWE-1204 "Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)" was considered because the description mentions keys and salt and the IV could have been weak. However, the root cause is not a broken IV, but the use of a **hardcoded** key and salt.

CWE-1394 "Use of Default Cryptographic Key" was considered because this is a common real-world problem. However, the root cause is not a default key but a **hardcoded** key.

The selection of CWE-321 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: the use of a hard-coded cryptographic key.
