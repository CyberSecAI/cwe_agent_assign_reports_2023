## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is that CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] is a high-level Class that could have more specific children. However, in this case, the provided information is very limited and only states that there is **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**. There are more specific CWEs, such as CWE-359 [Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor], but there isn't enough information to say that this vulnerability specifically exposed private personal information.
