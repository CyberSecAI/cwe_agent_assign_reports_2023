CWE-787 is considered as a potential impact based on the description mentioning memory corruption, a common result of out-of-bounds writes, though the information isn't definitive enough to make it a primary classification.  The \"CanPrecede\" relationships for CWE-787 are also relevant, linking it to other potential memory corruption causes.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe825\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe367 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **time-of-check time-of-use** condition (CWE-367), which then leads to memory corruption. The memory corruption *could* manifest as an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) if the TOCTOU condition allows writing to a memory location outside the intended buffer.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment relies heavily on the **rootcause** \"time-of-check time-of-use\" directly mentioned in the vulnerability description. This strongly suggests CWE-367 as the most appropriate primary classification.\n\nThe evidence supporting the classification is the following:\n\n*   \"Memory corruption in display due to **time-of-check time-of-use** of metadata reserved size...\"\n\nThe retriever results also support this, listing CWE-367 as the top candidate. The graph relationships confirm the potential for CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) to follow as a consequence of a memory corruption issue, but it isn't definitively stated that this is the mechanism of the memory corruption.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-367 directly addresses the **time-of-check time-of-use** condition, and CWE-787 is a reasonable potential impact given the memory corruption. More specific variants would require further evidence that isn't present.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-127: Buffer Under-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations prior to the targeted buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-786: Access of Memory Location Before Start of Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available.
