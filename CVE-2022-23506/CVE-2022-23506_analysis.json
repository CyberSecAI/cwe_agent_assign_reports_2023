It has a parent relationship with CWE-538 (**Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory**) and CWE-200 (**Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**). The selection was influenced by the direct match to the vulnerability description and the base level abstraction.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe538[\"CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe538\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe312 -->|PEEROF| cwe532\n    cwe798 -->|PEEROF| cwe532\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe538,cwe200,cwe312,cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper secret masking**, leading to the exposure of sensitive AWS credentials in packer log files.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Improper secret masking** during packer builds.\n  - **Weakness:** Insertion of sensitive information into log files.\n  - **Impact:** Exposure of AWS access keys and secret keys, potentially allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the AWS account.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-532 (**Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File**) as the primary candidate, which aligns with the description of the vulnerability. The vulnerability involves the **improper masking** of secrets, specifically AWS credentials, which leads to their inclusion in log files. This matches the CWE-532 description: \"The product writes sensitive information to a log file.\"\n\nThe supporting evidence for this decision is present in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section: \"The vulnerability stems from **improper masking** of AWS credentials within log files during Packer builds performed by Rosco. Specifically, the `aws_access_key` and `aws_secret_key` were not being masked by default.\" The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" also highlights the **improper secret masking** as the root cause.\n\nCWE-312 (**Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information**) and CWE-798 (**Use of Hard-coded Credentials**) were also considered, as the credentials were not encrypted/masked and potentially hardcoded. However, the core issue is the presence of the credentials in the logs due to the **improper masking**, making CWE-532 the more direct and accurate classification.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by confirming that CWE-532 is a base level CWE and is related to the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause and mechanism of the vulnerability, avoiding more generic classifications.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Technical Explanation:** While the primary issue is the insertion into logs, the stored credentials being in cleartext increases the risk.
