While CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information) is related, CWE-532 is a more precise fit. CWE-532 is a child of CWE-538 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory) and CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information). CWE-209 is a child of CWE-200 and CWE-755 (Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions). The choice of Base level CWEs is appropriate as it is the lowest level of abstraction that still accurately represents the weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe538[\"CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe755[\"CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe538\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe209 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe209 -->|CHILDOF| cwe755\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe209 secondary\n    class cwe538,cwe200,cwe755 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **improper handling of exceptions**, leading to the logging of sensitive data:\n  1. **Improper Exception Handling:** The application **fails to prevent** the logging of complete exception stack traces.\n  2. **Sensitive Information Logging (CWE-532):** System credentials/keys are **inadvertently written** to log files.\n  3. **Potential Information Disclosure:** An attacker gains access to the log files.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis and final conclusion strongly align due to the clear evidence of sensitive information being written to log files. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly mentions \"The vulnerability stems from the logging of complete exception stack traces by TYPO3's exception handlers. This process inadvertently included sensitive information like system-internal credentials or keys (e.g., database credentials) in plaintext within log files.\" and \"CWE-532: This CWE (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) is specifically cited.\"\n\nThe graph relationships reinforce the selection of CWE-532 as the primary weakness because it directly captures the core issue of sensitive information being logged. While CWE-209 is related, it's more general and less specific to the act of logging the sensitive data.\n\nThe selection of CWE-532 is at the optimal level of specificity because it is a Base-level CWE that accurately describes the vulnerability's root cause.\nCWE-532 directly addresses the **insertion of sensitive information into log files**, which aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description, where system credentials are logged as plaintext in exception handlers.\nCWE-209 is a secondary candidate because the **generation of an error message** is part of the process, but the core issue is the logging of sensitive data, not just the generation of the error message itself.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used**: This is a parent of CWE-532, but less specific.
