CWE-476 is a base-level CWE, representing a specific type of error. CWE-787 is also a base-level CWE, indicating the consequence of the **NULL Pointer Dereference**. Both are child of CWE-119.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe476 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe476 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe476 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **NULL Pointer Dereference** (CWE-476) which then leads to an **Out-of-bounds Write** (CWE-787).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference)** as the primary weakness, based on the **rootcause** mentioned in the vulnerability description: \"**Null pointer dereference** vulnerability\". The secondary weakness is **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)**, triggered as a consequence of the **NULL Pointer Dereference**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also confirms that the **root cause** is a **null pointer dereference** in the `parser_hvcC` function, leading to a potential **out-of-bounds write**.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-476 can precede CWE-787. This helped solidify the understanding that the **NULL Pointer Dereference** is the initial flaw that allows the **Out-of-bounds Write**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the base level of specificity, providing the most accurate representation of the vulnerability based on the available information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as
