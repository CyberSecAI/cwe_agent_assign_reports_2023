The vulnerability description explicitly states: \"**Hard-coded Password** vulnerability...allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to obtain information about the project file.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further confirms this: \"The vulnerability is due to the use of a hard-coded password\" and notes \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Use of hard-coded password (CWE-259)\".\n\nThe Retriever Results also lists CWE-259 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-259 \"Use of Hard-coded Password\" is the most appropriate choice because it is a Variant-level CWE that specifically addresses the use of hard-coded passwords for authentication, aligning perfectly with the vulnerability description. The mapping guidance for CWE-259 states that it is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the **root causes** of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-798 \"Use of Hard-coded Credentials\" was considered but not chosen because CWE-259 is a more specific variant of CWE-798. While CWE-798 is a valid mapping, CWE-259 provides a more precise description of the vulnerability.\nCWE-321 \"Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\" was also considered but is not applicable as the vulnerability specifically involves a password, not a cryptographic key.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
