The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the injection of shell metacharacters, aligning directly with the characteristics of CWE-78. CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command) and CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')), showing a clear hierarchical relationship.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with the application's **failure to properly neutralize** special elements in the `host` parameter. This leads directly to OS command injection, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary, which clearly indicates an **OS command injection** vulnerability due to **insufficient sanitization** of the `host` parameter.\n\nThe description states that the `/api/common/ping` endpoint is vulnerable to remote command execution via shell metacharacters in the host parameter. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating that the root cause is **insufficient sanitization** of the `host` parameter, allowing the injection of arbitrary shell commands.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-78 as the top candidate, further supporting this assessment. CWE-78 is a base-level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 5.03\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-184\n- CANALSOBE -> CWE-88\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-77\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-77\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-74\n\n## CWE Selection Justification\nCWE-78 is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the injection of shell metacharacters in the `host` parameter leading to remote command execution, which aligns directly with the characteristics of CWE-78. The description explicitly mentions the impact of remote command execution, the vector of shell metacharacters, and the **failure to sanitize** the `host` parameter.\n\nOther CWEs Considered and Rejected:\n- CWE-74: While CWE-74 is a parent of CWE-78, it is a class-level CWE and is too general. The vulnerability description provides sufficient detail to map to the more specific base-level CWE-78.\n- CWE-88: While CWE-88 (Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')) is a related weakness, the primary issue is the injection of arbitrary shell commands, making CWE-78 a more accurate fit.\n- CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') - This CWE is too broad and does not specifically address the OS command injection aspect of the vulnerability.\n- CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection') - This CWE is not applicable as the vulnerability does not involve dynamic evaluation of code.\n- CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs - While this could be a contributing factor, the primary issue is the lack of proper neutralization of special elements, making CWE-78 a more direct mapping.",
