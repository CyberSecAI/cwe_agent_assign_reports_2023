However, the mapping guidance discourages its use, recommending focus on root-cause weaknesses. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct correlation between the vulnerability description \"**authentication downgrade**\" and the name of CWE-757. CWE-300 was considered because the attack involves a man-in-the-middle position, but it was deemed less appropriate as it's more of a consequence than the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe757[\"CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')\"]\n    cwe300[\"CWE-300: Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism with Inadequate Security\"]\n    \n    cwe757 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe300 -->|CHILDOF| cwe923\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe757 primary\n    class cwe300 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the **authentication downgrade** (CWE-757) allowing an attacker in a man-in-the-middle position (potentially related to CWE-300) to gain HTTP access to the camera, which is the impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the explicit mention of \"**authentication downgrade**\" in the vulnerability description, directly aligning with CWE-757. The description states: \"An **authentication downgrade** in the server in Citilog 8.0 allows an attacker (in a man in the middle position between the server and its smart camera Axis M1125) to achieve HTTP access to the camera.\"\n\nCWE-300 was considered due to the man-in-the-middle attack vector, but the mapping guidance discourages its use unless it's a root cause, which isn't the case here.
