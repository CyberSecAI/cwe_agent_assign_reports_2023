CWE-94 is a more specific type of injection where the injected content is code, making it the more appropriate choice. The vulnerability description states that the **missing sanitization** leads to arbitrary code execution, clearly indicating a code injection scenario.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\"]\n    \n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe913 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **missing sanitization** of input, which then leads to the ability to inject code, ultimately resulting in arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points to CWE-94, given the explicit mention of arbitrary code execution and the root cause being **missing sanitization**. The evidence includes the vulnerability description, which clearly states the impact and the root cause.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states: \"All versions of package morgan-json are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution due to **missing sanitization** of input passed to the Function constructor.\" This direct evidence supports the selection of CWE-94.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the more specific nature of CWE-94 compared to its parent CWE-74. The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately reflects the code injection aspect of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
