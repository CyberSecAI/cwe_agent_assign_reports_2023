The analysis considered CWEs related to cryptographic issues, information exposure, and potential synchronization problems, but the primary focus remained on the **improper crypto** usage as the core weakness.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description key phrases states: \"**rootcause:** **improperly used crypto**\" which aligns well with CWE-327.\n\nThe graph relationships helped to confirm that a more specific CWE related to cryptographic algorithms (CWE-327) is more appropriate than the higher-level cryptographic issues (CWE-310). CWE-327 provides a more precise description of the weakness than CWE-310.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-327 directly addresses the use of broken or risky cryptographic algorithms, which is the core issue described in the vulnerability.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Vulnerability Mapping Notes**: Allowed\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**improperly used crypto**,\" which directly aligns with the characteristics of CWE-327.
