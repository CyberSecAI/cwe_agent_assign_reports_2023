CWE-96 is a child of CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code). CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is included as a secondary weakness since the root cause is **improper input sanitization**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe96[\"CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe96 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe96 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe96 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n    class cwe94 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input sanitization**, leading to the injection of malicious code into a configuration file, and ultimately resulting in remote code execution.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Improper input sanitization**\n  - **Weakness:** CWE-96 Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')\n  - **Impact:** Remote Code Execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-96 as the primary weakness due to the injection of code into a static configuration file. This assessment is based on the vulnerability description and the provided CVE reference.\n\nThe evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section supports this: \"The 'Encryption Key' parameter on the installation page is not properly filtered. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary strings into the `application/config/config.php` file during the installation process.\"\n\nThe retriever results also support this finding. The top combined results lists CWE-96 as the second highest rated CWE.\nCWE-96 is a Base level weakness, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is added as a secondary weakness because the **rootcause** is **improper input sanitization**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
