Also, the chain relationships such as CWE-208 CanPrecede CWE-385 (Covert Timing Channel) and CWE-208 CanPrecede CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm). The observable timing discrepancy is the weakness that is exploited to retrieve the RSA private key.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe208[\"CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe203[\"CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe385[\"CWE-385: Covert Timing Channel\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n\n    cwe208 -->|CHILDOF| cwe203\n    cwe208 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe385\n    cwe208 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe327\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe208 primary\n    class cwe203,cwe385,cwe327 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **logic error when the RSA key is stored in memory on a hardware platform that performs hardware-based cryptography**. This **logic error** leads to an **observable timing discrepancy** that is exploited via a Lenstra side-channel attack to **retrieve an RSA private key**. If the attacker obtains the RSA private key, they could use the key to impersonate a device or to decrypt the device traffic.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified a vulnerability related to RSA key handling in Cisco ASA and FTD software. The **root cause** is a **logic error** during RSA key storage in memory, making it vulnerable to a Lenstra side-channel attack, which leads to an **observable timing discrepancy**. The primary impact is the potential retrieval of the RSA private key by an unauthenticated, remote attacker.\n\nThe most appropriate CWE is CWE-208 Observable Timing Discrepancy. This aligns with the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions the side-channel attack. The additional CWEs were considered because the **logic error** resulted in the use of a **risky cryptographic implementation**, but the primary weakness and how it is exploited is due to the timing discrepancy.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-208 is a Base level CWE, and accurately represents the timing discrepancy exploited in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTwo separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
