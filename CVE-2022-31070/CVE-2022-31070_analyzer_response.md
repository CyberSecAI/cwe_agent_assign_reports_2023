# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-212 | Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-201, is a base-level weakness focused on the insertion of sensitive data into sent data. It has a parent-child relationship with CWE-200, which is a higher-level class related to information exposure. The secondary CWE, CWE-212, is also a base-level weakness concerned with the improper removal of sensitive information. CWE-212 can precede CWE-201. Given the description of the vulnerability, where sensitive cookies are being inadvertently exposed, CWE-201 is the more precise fit.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with the **weakness** of the library **not having a way to block sensitive cookies**. This leads to the **impact** of sensitive cookies being inadvertently exposed to backend services. Therefore, the chain is: Lack of cookie blocking -> Insertion of sensitive data into sent data.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on the library's failure to prevent sensitive cookies from being forwarded, leading to potential exposure. This aligned well with CWE-201's description of inserting sensitive information into sent data. The evidence from the vulnerability description key phrases and CVE Reference Links Content Summary strongly supports this.

The vulnerability description states the **weakness** is that the library **did not have a way to block sensitive cookies**. The **impact** is "sensitive cookies being inadvertently exposed to such services." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states the **root cause** as "The `nestjs-proxy` library, in versions prior to the patched versions, lacked a mechanism to prevent sensitive cookies from being forwarded to backend services". The high retriever score for CWE-201, along with its "Allowed" usage designation, further supports its selection as the primary CWE.

CWE-212 was considered as a secondary CWE due to the fact that the cookies containing sensitive information were not properly removed before being transferred. However, the core issue is the inclusion of sensitive data in the transmitted data, rather than the failure to remove the sensitive data before storage or transfer *per se*. Thus, CWE-201 is a more precise fit.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they directly address the root cause and the resulting exposure of sensitive information.
Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions is not set, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')

**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product acts as an intermediary HTTP agent
         (such as a proxy or firewall) in the data flow between two
         entities such as a client and server, but it does not
         interpret malformed HTTP requests or responses in ways that
         are consistent with how the messages will be processed by
