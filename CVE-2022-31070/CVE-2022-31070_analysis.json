It has a parent-child relationship with CWE-200, which is a higher-level class related to information exposure. The secondary CWE, CWE-212, is also a base-level weakness concerned with the improper removal of sensitive information. CWE-212 can precede CWE-201. Given the description of the vulnerability, where sensitive cookies are being inadvertently exposed, CWE-201 is the more precise fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe212 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe201\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe212 secondary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **weakness** of the library **not having a way to block sensitive cookies**. This leads to the **impact** of sensitive cookies being inadvertently exposed to backend services. Therefore, the chain is: Lack of cookie blocking -> Insertion of sensitive data into sent data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the library's failure to prevent sensitive cookies from being forwarded, leading to potential exposure. This aligned well with CWE-201's description of inserting sensitive information into sent data. The evidence from the vulnerability description key phrases and CVE Reference Links Content Summary strongly supports this.\n\nThe vulnerability description states the **weakness** is that the library **did not have a way to block sensitive cookies**. The **impact** is \"sensitive cookies being inadvertently exposed to such services.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states the **root cause** as \"The `nestjs-proxy` library, in versions prior to the patched versions, lacked a mechanism to prevent sensitive cookies from being forwarded to backend services\". The high retriever score for CWE-201, along with its \"Allowed\" usage designation, further supports its selection as the primary CWE.\n\nCWE-212 was considered as a secondary CWE due to the fact that the cookies containing sensitive information were not properly removed before being transferred. However, the core issue is the inclusion of sensitive data in the transmitted data, rather than the failure to remove the sensitive data before storage or transfer *per se*. Thus, CWE-201 is a more precise fit.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they directly address the root cause and the resulting exposure of sensitive information.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of
