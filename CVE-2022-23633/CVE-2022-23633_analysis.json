It has child CWEs that could potentially be more specific, but the description aligns well with the general nature of the vulnerability. CWE-226 (Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse) is a Base-level CWE and a potential child of CWE-404 in some scenarios, which could indicate a more specific weakness. CWE-488 (Exposure of Data Element to Wrong Session) is related because the **improper resource close** can result in data leakage to another session.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\"]\n    cwe226[\"CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\"]\n    cwe488[\"CWE-488: Exposure of Data Element to Wrong Session\"]\n\n    cwe226 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe488 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]    \n    cwe226 -->|CHILDOF| cwe459[\"CWE-459: Incomplete Cleanup\"]\n    cwe226 -->|CHILDOF| cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage\"]\n    cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\"] -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe404 primary\n    class cwe226,cwe488 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with an **improper resource close**, specifically the response body not being closed. This leads to the `ActionDispatchExecutor` failing to reset thread-local state. Consequently, sensitive data is leaked to subsequent requests.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **improper resource close** as the primary issue, leading to data leakage.\n\nThe analysis is primarily based on the following evidence from the provided text:\n\n*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** \"**weakness:** **Improper Resource Close**\", \"**impact:** data being leaked to subsequent requests\"\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** \"Under certain circumstances response bodies will not be closed. In the event a response is not notified of a `close`, `ActionDispatch::Executor` will not know to reset thread local state for the next request.\" \"This can lead to data being leaked to subsequent requests\"\n\nCWE-404 (Improper Resource Shutdown or Release) accurately captures the root cause of the vulnerability. The other CWEs were considered for their relationship to the resource handling and potential consequences of the **improper close**, but were not a precise fit for the root cause. CWE-226 is a closer base level mapping but isn't as direct as CWE-404.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**:
