It represents a more specific case where authorization checks are entirely absent. The secondary CWE, CWE-497 **Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere**, is related to the impact of the missing authorization, where sensitive information is exposed because of the **missing permission check**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe497 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe497 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission check** (CWE-862), leading to the **exposure of credential IDs** (CWE-497).\n  - The **missing authorization** is the root cause.\n  - The **enumeration of credential IDs** is the impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the description of the vulnerability, strongly suggests CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description key phrases clearly indicate a **missing permission check**, which directly aligns with the definition of CWE-862.\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary further reinforces this assessment, stating that the `kubernetes-cd` Plugin lacks permission checks in several HTTP endpoints, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information. This confirms that the root cause is indeed a **missing authorization**.\n\nThe Retriever Results also support this assessment, with CWE-862 being ranked as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-497 **Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere** is included as a secondary CWE because the impact of the **missing authorization** is the **exposure of credential IDs**, which are sensitive system information.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is based on the evidence provided, the relationship analysis, and the MITRE mapping guidance. The CWE is at the Class level, but given the clear indication of a **missing authorization check**, it accurately represents the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-285 **Improper Authorization** was considered, but ultimately not selected as the primary CWE because it is too general. The vulnerability description specifically mentions a **missing permission check**, which is more accurately represented by CWE-862. The MITRE mapping guidance also discourages the use of CWE-285, suggesting more specific alternatives like CWE-862.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
