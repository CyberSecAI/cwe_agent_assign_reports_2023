CWE-807 and CWE-472 are related in that the flawed implementation relies on potentially untrusted inputs (cookies, web requests), and fails to validate parameters assumed to be immutable. These relationships highlight how a flawed core authentication mechanism can be exploited through manipulation of input data.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe303[\"CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\"]\n    cwe807[\"CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\"]\n    cwe472[\"CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\"]\n    \n    cwe807 -->|RELATED_TO| cwe303\n    cwe472 -->|RELATED_TO| cwe303\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe303 primary\n    class cwe807,cwe472 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect implementation** of the \"Remember Me\" function (CWE-303). This leads to a reliance on potentially **untrusted inputs** (CWE-807) and the possibility of exploiting **externally controlled parameters** that should be immutable (CWE-472). The final impact is authentication bypass.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the vulnerability stems from a flawed implementation of the \"Remember Me\" authentication function. The primary evidence is: \"The root cause of the authentication bypass vulnerability is a conditional logic flaw in the \u201cremember me\u201d functionality. The `rememberMe()` function checks if `arguments.userHash` has a zero length or if it matches the stored `rsUser.userHash`. If the length is zero, the function proceeds to log in the user using the provided userid.\" This flaw is best represented by CWE-303 (Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm).\n\nThe retriever results and graph relationships influenced the selection of secondary CWEs. Specifically, the crafted web request exploits the **reliance on untrusted inputs** (CWE-807) and manipulates **assumed-immutable parameters** (CWE-472) in the request.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-303 directly addresses the root cause, while CWE-807 and CWE-472 highlight contributing factors that enable the exploitation of the flawed authentication logic.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Explanation**: The vulnerability description indicates that the **Remember Me function** relies on a \"userHash\" value that can be manipulated in a web request. If the \"userHash\" has a zero length, the function proceeds to log in the user based on the \"userid\" alone. This shows a **reliance on an untrusted input** (\"userHash\") for a security decision (authentication). This aligns with CWE-807.\n*Confidence Score: 0.7*\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Explanation**: The **root cause** is identified as a \"conditional logic flaw in the 'remember me' functionality.\" The `rememberMe()` function's logic is flawed because it logs in the user if `arguments.userHash` has a zero length. This is an **incorrect implementation** of the authentication algorithm, fitting CWE-303.\n*Confidence Score: 0.9*\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Explanation**: The vulnerability involves crafting a web request with a blank or specially crafted 'userHash' cookie. The 'userHash' is assumed to be a secure, immutable value but is actually externally controllable. The application **does not sufficiently verify** this input, allowing an attacker to **bypass authentication**. This aligns with CWE-472.\n*Confidence Score: 0.6*\n\n**CWEs Considered but Not Used:**\n\n*   **CWE-287 Improper Authentication:** While this is a high-level classification of the vulnerability, it is too general. The detailed root cause is an **incorrect implementation** of an authentication algorithm.\n*   **CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key:** This is less applicable because the vulnerability is related to bypassing authentication, not authorization.\n*   **CWE-294 Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay:** This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability does not involve replaying captured network traffic. Instead, it is about crafting a specific request.\n*   **CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'):** This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability does not involve injecting malicious scripts into web pages.",
