CWE-416 can also precede CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input) and CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition). CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource after Expiration\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe416 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe120\n    cwe416 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe123\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n    class cwe825,cwe672,cwe120,cwe123,cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **use after free** condition in WebGL, leading to potential **heap corruption**. A remote attacker can exploit this by crafting a malicious HTML page.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is a **use after free** vulnerability, which is accurately represented by CWE-416. The vulnerability description key phrases and the CVE reference links content summary both explicitly mention \"use after free,\" making it the most appropriate CWE. The description states, \"Use after free in WebGL in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.114 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit **heap corruption** via a crafted HTML page.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary section states: \"Root cause of vulnerability: Use-after-free vulnerability in WebGL.\"\n\nCWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) was considered as a secondary weakness because the vulnerability description mentions \"heap corruption\", which can be a consequence of a **use after free** if the freed memory is reallocated and then improperly written to. However, the primary issue is the **use after free**, and heap corruption is a potential impact.\n\nThe confidence in assigning CWE-416 as the primary CWE is high (1.0) due to the explicit mention of \"use after free\" in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The confidence in assigning CWE-787 as a secondary CWE is lower (0.7) because it is only a potential consequence of the primary weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Rationale for not selecting*: While race conditions can sometimes lead to use-after-free vulnerabilities, there's no explicit mention of a race condition in this vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Rationale for not selecting*: There's no mention of locking mechanisms or improper locking in the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Rationale for not selecting*: While related to resource management, it doesn't specifically describe a use-after-free condition.
