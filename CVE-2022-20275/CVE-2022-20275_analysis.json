Because the vulnerability description specifically mentions a \"side channel information disclosure,\" and CWE-203 directly addresses observable discrepancies that can lead to information disclosure, it is a more specific and accurate representation of the weakness than its parent, CWE-200. There are no other relevant relationships that impact the CWE selection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe203[\"CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe203 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe203 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of root cause and weaknesses for the Vulnerability Description:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **side channel information disclosure**\n2.  **Impact:** determine whether an app is installed\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-203 as the primary candidate due to the \"**side channel information disclosure**\" mentioned in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases.\" This aligns well with the description of CWE-203, which focuses on observable discrepancies that expose security-relevant information. The retriever results also list CWE-203 with a reasonable score.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"In DevicePolicyManager, there is a possible way to determine whether an app is installed, without query permissions, due to **side channel information disclosure**. This could lead to local information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed.\"\n\nThis statement provides direct evidence of a side channel being exploited to disclose information about installed apps. This matches CWE-203's description: \"The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\"\n\nCWE-200 was also considered as a parent CWE, but the mapping guidance discourages its use as a general \"loss of confidentiality\" category. The guidance suggests considering children like CWE-203 when applicable. The decision to use CWE-203 is based on its greater specificity and direct alignment with the side-channel nature of the information disclosure.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately captures the root cause \u2013 the observable discrepancy \u2013 rather than just the impact (information disclosure).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**: The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n**Mapping Guidance**: Usage: Allowed-with-Review, Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**: The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n**Mapping Guidance**: Usage: Allowed, Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**: The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n**Mapping Guidance**: Usage: Allowed, Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**: The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n**Mapping Guidance**: Usage: Allowed-with-Review, Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**: The product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n**Mapping Guidance**: Usage: Discouraged, Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**: The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n**Mapping Guidance**: Usage: Discouraged, Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**: The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n**Mapping Guidance**: Usage: Allowed-with-Review, Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**: The product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n**Mapping Guidance**: Usage: Discouraged, Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-459: Incomplete Cleanup\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**: The product does not properly \"clean up\" and remove temporary or supporting resources after they have been used.\n**Mapping Guidance**: Usage: Allowed, Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**: The product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n**Mapping Guidance**: Usage: Discouraged, Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
