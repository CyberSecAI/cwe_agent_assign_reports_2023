The vulnerability description explicitly states \"**Improper Access Control**\". While CWE-284 is a class, it directly reflects the stated weakness. CWE-862 represents a more specific case of missing authorization checks, which aligns with the ability to post comments on unpublished articles. This is a specific type of access control failure, where a necessary authorization check is absent.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper access control**, specifically the **missing authorization** check, leading to the impact of unauthorized commenting on unpublished articles.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the analysis focused on the stated \"**Improper Access Control**\" in the vulnerability description. The key phrase directly points to a problem related to access controls. The retriever results also suggested CWE-639 [Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key], CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization], and CWE-285 [Improper Authorization]. However, the evidence from the commit diff and huntr.dev page indicates a more fundamental problem of a **missing authorization** check rather than an incorrect one or a bypass via a user-controlled key. The application **fails to** prevent comments on articles that are not yet published.\n\nCWE-284 [Improper Access Control] is selected as the primary CWE because it is explicitly mentioned in the vulnerability description. CWE-862 [Missing Authorization] is chosen as a secondary CWE because it more precisely describes the root cause: the absence of a check to prevent unauthorized commenting. CWE-862 being a child of CWE-284 makes this combination logical.\n\nThe abstraction level of Base for CWE-862 provides a more granular view of the vulnerability than the Class level of CWE-284.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.

The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
