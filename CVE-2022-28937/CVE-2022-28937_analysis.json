It is related to CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation) as a child. It can also precede CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE and is a child of CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource\"]\n    cwe682[\"CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe190 -->|CHILDOF| cwe682\n    cwe190 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    cwe400 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe664,cwe682,cwe20,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a malicious node broadcasting a large view change message with the view set to int64_max. This leads to an integer overflow when other nodes try to switch to the view + 1, resetting the value to zero. This causes the system to get stuck and unable to process blocks.\n  - Root Cause: Integer Overflow (CWE-190)\n  - Impact: System stuck, unable to process blocks, abnormal consensus (Resource Consumption - CWE-400)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is an integer overflow (CWE-190) in the view change process. The \"Root cause of vulnerability\" in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this: \"Integer overflow during view change process.\" The supporting evidence also states: \"The view value, which is an int64, can overflow when a malicious node broadcasts a large view change message with view set to int64_max. When other nodes receive this message, they try to switch to the view + 1 which causes an overflow and reset the value to zero.\" This aligns directly with the description of CWE-190, where a calculation produces an integer overflow or wraparound.\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is considered as a secondary weakness because the integer overflow causes the system to become stuck and unable to process blocks. While resource consumption is a result, the root cause is the integer overflow. Therefore, CWE-190 is the more appropriate primary CWE.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-190 is a Base CWE, which is preferred. CWE-400 is a Class CWE, but it accurately reflects the impact of the integer overflow.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially
