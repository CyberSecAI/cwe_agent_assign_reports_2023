It is related to CWE-119 (**Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**) as a ChildOf. Several other CWEs like CWE-825 (**Expired Pointer Dereference**), CWE-824 (**Access of Uninitialized Pointer**), CWE-823 (**Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset**), and CWE-822 (**Untrusted Pointer Dereference**) can follow CWE-787. This indicates that an out-of-bounds write can lead to a variety of subsequent issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe824[\"CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\"]\n    cwe823[\"CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset\"]\n    cwe822[\"CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|ChildOf| cwe119\n    cwe787 -->|CanFollow| cwe825\n    cwe787 -->|CanFollow| cwe824\n    cwe787 -->|CanFollow| cwe823\n    cwe787 -->|CanFollow| cwe822\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe825,cwe824,cwe823,cwe822 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with a **configuration weakness**, leading to **memory corruption**, specifically an out-of-bounds write. The initial **configuration weakness** allows for data to be written outside the intended memory boundaries.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description mentions a **configuration weakness** leading to **memory corruption** in the video component of Snapdragon products. The retriever results indicate that CWE-787 (**Out-of-bounds Write**) is the best match, which aligns with the description of **memory corruption** due to a write operation exceeding buffer boundaries. The description of CWE-787 matches the vulnerability's description, and it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.\n\nCWE-822 (**Untrusted Pointer Dereference**) was considered, but the description focuses more on the use of untrusted pointers, which isn't directly stated in the provided vulnerability description. The vulnerability description states \"**configuration weakness**\" leading to **memory corruption** which is closest to out-of-bounds write.\n\nCWE-1285 (**Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input**) was also considered because of its relation to indices and offsets, but the description doesn't specifically mention improper validation, only a **configuration weakness**. Also, CWE-1285 is the parent of CWE-129 which also was considered.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, CWE-787 is the most appropriate mapping due to its direct relation to the **memory corruption** caused by writing outside of intended buffer boundaries.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- **CWE-787**: The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. The vulnerability description mentions a **configuration weakness** that leads to **memory corruption**, which aligns with an out-of-bounds write.",
