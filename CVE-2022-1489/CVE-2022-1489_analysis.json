CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**. CWE-122 **Heap-based Buffer Overflow** is a variant of CWE-787. This indicates a hierarchical relationship where CWE-122 is more specific than CWE-787, but the provided information does not provide enough details to confirm it's a heap-based overflow, so CWE-787 is the better fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe122 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **out of bounds memory access** (**ROOTCAUSE**) leading to **heap corruption** (**WEAKNESS**) and potentially allowing a remote attacker to exploit the issue via specific user interactions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-787 **Out-of-bounds Write** as the primary candidate, due to the explicit mention of out-of-bounds memory access in the vulnerability description. The description states \"**Out of bounds memory access** in UI Shelf in Google Chrome on Chrome OS, Lacros prior to 101.0.4951.41 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit **heap corruption** via specific user interactions.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also mentions \"**root_cause**: Out of bounds memory access in UI Shelf.\" This evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-787.\n\nCWE-122 **Heap-based Buffer Overflow** was considered because the vulnerability leads to **heap corruption**, indicating a potential overflow in the heap. However, the description doesn't explicitly state that a buffer overflow occurred, only that memory corruption resulted. Therefore, CWE-787 is a more accurate and broader classification.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but deemed less relevant. Race condition CWEs (e.g., CWE-366, CWE-362, CWE-364) were considered because of the term \"interactions,\" but there's no explicit mention of concurrency or timing issues. Similarly, CWE-416 **Use After Free** was considered, but there's no direct evidence of memory being freed and then reused. CWE-451 **User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information** was considered because the component is \"UI Shelf\" but the root cause is not misrepresentation but rather **out of bounds memory access**.\n\nThe final decision to select CWE-787 as the primary CWE is based on the direct evidence of out-of-bounds write, as stated in both the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. This is at the optimal level of specificity because it describes the fundamental error without making assumptions about the specific type of memory corruption beyond what's stated (i.e., heap corruption).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code uses a variable that has not been initialized, leading to unpredictable or unintended results.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses or accesses a resource that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize a critical resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
