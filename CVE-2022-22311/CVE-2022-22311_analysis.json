This CWE is related to CWE-345 (Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity) as a ChildOf. It also has a peer relationship with other authentication and cryptographic issues.\n\nThe secondary CWEs are CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) and CWE-649 (Reliance on Obfuscation or Encryption of Security-Relevant Inputs without Integrity Checking), both of which are Base level CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe649[\"CWE-649: Reliance on Obfuscation or Encryption of Security-Relevant Inputs without Integrity Checking\"]\n\n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe345,cwe319,cwe649 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper validation of JWT tokens** (CWE-347), which leads to the potential to obtain sensitive information or change information. Depending on the specific implementation, it could lead to cleartext transmission (CWE-319) or reliance on encryption without integrity checking (CWE-649) .\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is caused by **improper validation of JWT tokens**. The primary CWE selected is CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature) with a high confidence score of 0.9 because of the **rootcause** \"improper validation of JWT tokens\" that is explicitly identified in both the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" sections.\n\nCWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) was considered because the impact is \"obtain sensitive information\".\n\nCWE-649 (Reliance on Obfuscation or Encryption of Security-Relevant Inputs without Integrity Checking) was considered because of the mention of JWT, which is a type of token that could be obfuscated or encrypted. If the application relies on the encryption of JWT without proper integrity checks, it could be vulnerable to tampering.\n\nThe selection of CWE-347 as the primary CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is **improper validation of JWT tokens**. This is a base-level CWE, which is preferred.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
