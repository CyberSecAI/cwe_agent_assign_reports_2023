# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2021-22986

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-287 | Improper Authentication | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-287, which is a Base level weakness, directly addressing the **improper authentication**.
CWE-78, the secondary CWE, describes the specific impact of the **improper authentication**, OS command injection. It is a child of CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')), showing a more general form of command injection. CWE-78 can follow from CWE-184 (Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs), suggesting that an incomplete list of disallowed inputs might lead to command injection.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper authentication** (CWE-287), which allows an attacker to inject commands. This leads to OS command injection (CWE-78), enabling the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly states that the iControl REST interface has an **unauthenticated** remote command execution vulnerability. The key phrase highlights **improper authentication** as the root cause. This directly maps to CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), which describes a situation where the product does not properly authenticate users. The consequence of this is remote command execution, which aligns with CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')).

The retriever results list several CWEs. CWE-291 (Reliance on IP Address for Authentication) is not applicable as the vulnerability description does not mention IP-based authentication. CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption), CWE-1176 (Inefficient CPU Computation), and CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)) are also not directly relevant based on the description. CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management) is too general and doesn't capture the specific authentication failure. CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')) is related, but CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')) is more specific as it involves OS commands. CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is too general and doesn't describe the **authentication** bypass. CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) is also too general.

The final decision is based on the evidence of **improper authentication** leading to remote command execution. CWE-287 accurately captures the root cause, and CWE-78 describes the resulting command injection vulnerability. These CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity (Base) and are supported by the vulnerability description.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-99: Improper Control of Resource Identifiers ('Resource Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not restrict or incorrectly restricts the input before it is used as an identifier for a resource that may be outside the intended sphere of control.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally
