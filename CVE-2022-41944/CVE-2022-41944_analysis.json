While **discouraged** due to being a high-level class, it is most appropriate as the root cause within the constraints of available information. |\n| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.6 | Class | Secondary | The product performs an authorization check but does not correctly perform the check, allowing access to notifications for topics the user should not have access to. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship impacting the decision is the parent-child relationship between CWE-200 and several more specific CWEs. While options like CWE-201, CWE-538, and CWE-359 are tempting due to higher similarity scores, the evidence more broadly points to exposing information. Since the vulnerability allows a user to see topic titles (sensitive information) they should no longer have access to, CWE-200 is deemed the most accurate, albeit at a higher abstraction level. CWE-863 is secondary, representing the underlying flaw in authorization checking that leads to the exposure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe538[\"CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe538 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe863 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe201,cwe538,cwe359 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863), leading to the **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200) in the form of topic titles within notifications.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which involves users being able to see notifications for topics they no longer have access to, potentially exposing sensitive information in the topic title.\n\nThe analysis considered the retriever results, which suggested CWE-201, CWE-525, CWE-1390, CWE-863, and CWE-538. However, after carefully reviewing the vulnerability description and the provided CVE reference, it was determined that the core issue is the broader **exposure of sensitive information** due to **incorrect authorization**.\n\nThe final decision was to classify the vulnerability as CWE-200 (**Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**) as the primary CWE and CWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**) as the secondary CWE. CWE-200 captures the essence of the vulnerability, which is the exposure of sensitive information (topic titles) to unauthorized users. While CWE-200 is a class-level CWE and is generally **discouraged**, it is deemed the most appropriate in this case because the available information doesn't pinpoint a more specific weakness related to data handling or storage. CWE-863 is included as a secondary CWE to highlight the underlying authorization issue that enables the information exposure.\n\nThe decision is heavily based on the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" specifically the lines: \"Specifically, users could still see notifications for topics they no longer have permission to access\" and \"Exposure of sensitive information: If a topic title contained sensitive information, an attacker could potentially view it through the notification even after they lost access to the topic itself.\" This evidence directly supports the classification of CWE-200 and CWE-863.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
