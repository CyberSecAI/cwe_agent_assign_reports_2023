## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is: **improper handling of binding to an already bound chain** leads to **denial of service**.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis suggests that the vulnerability is due to the system allowing binding to an already bound chain which leads to denial of service. This is best described by CWE-675: Multiple Operations on Resource in Single-Operation Context. The evidence to support this includes the vulnerability description which states "A denial of service can occur upon binding to an already bound chain." The retriever results also show that CWE-675 is the top combined result.

CWE-404 was also considered because the issue involves a resource that is not properly released, but it wasn't binding to an already bound chain.

The selection of CWE-675 is at the optimal level of specificity because it is a Class-level CWE that accurately describes the vulnerability.
