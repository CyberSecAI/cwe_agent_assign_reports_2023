A secondary weakness is CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** because there is a step to authorize a user missing in the API routes. The relationship between these CWEs are that they are children of CWE-284 **Improper Access Control**. CWE-287 can also be preceded by CWE-613 **Insufficient Session Expiration** but that does not apply to the description in question.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n    class cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper authorization and authentication checks** on multiple API routes. This leads to an attacker gaining unauthorized access, which can then result in remote code execution, denial-of-service conditions, and the ability to obtain sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **root cause** as the **lack of proper authorization and authentication checks** on multiple API routes. This is supported by the \"**Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**\" section, which highlights \"**does not perform proper authorization and authentication checks**\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this, stating: \"The vulnerability is due to the **lack of proper authorization and authentication checks** on multiple API routes within the affected Mimosa products.\"\n\nThe retriever results suggested CWE-284 **Improper Access Control** and CWE-285 **Improper Authorization**. However, CWE-284 is a Pillar and too high level of an Abstraction, and CWE-285 is discouraged. Given the specific nature of the vulnerability, the assessment was refined to include CWE-287 **Improper Authentication** and CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** instead.\n\nThe final selection of CWEs is based on the evidence and relationship analysis. CWE-287 and CWE-862 accurately represent the **weakness** and are at an appropriate level of specificity (Class).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were
