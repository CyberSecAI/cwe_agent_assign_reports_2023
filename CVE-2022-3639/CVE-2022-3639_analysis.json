It has child CWEs like CWE-770 and CWE-407 that are more specific.\n- CWE-400 is a Class-level weakness, and the guidance discourages its use when more specific children exist.\n- CWE-770 (Base) and CWE-407 (Class) provide more granularity.\n- CWE-400 is related to CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime) through a ChildOf relationship.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe407 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe400 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe407 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper data handling** leading to an inefficient algorithm, eventually resulting in high CPU usage and a denial of service.\n- The root cause is **improper data handling** during branch creation.\n- This leads to an inefficient algorithm to find a unique branch name.\n- The inefficient algorithm results in high CPU usage.\n- High CPU usage leads to a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **improper data handling** as the root cause, leading to high CPU usage. The Retriever Results pointed to CWE-400, CWE-1333, and others.\n\nThe final decision is to use CWE-400 as the primary CWE, with CWE-770 and CWE-407 as secondary CWEs. This is based on the evidence of **improper data handling** that leads to uncontrolled resource consumption, specifically CPU usage.\n\nThe CWE selection is at the optimal level of specificity as CWE-400 describes the general issue of uncontrolled resource consumption, while CWE-770 and CWE-407 provide more specific details about the allocation of resources without limits and the inefficient algorithmic complexity, respectively.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
