While it's generally preferred to select a Base or Variant CWE, the evidence points directly to **insufficient error handling**. The vulnerability description highlights the crashing of the local malware analysis process, which aligns with the characteristics of CWE-755.\n\nCWE-400 and CWE-770 were considered due to their relevance to denial-of-service conditions and resource management. However, they represent the impact of the vulnerability rather than the root cause, which is the **insufficient error handling**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe755[\"CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\"]\n\n    cwe755 -->|CHILDOF| cwe703[\"CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    cwe400 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe755 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient error handling** (CWE-755). This leads to a crash in the local malware analysis process, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. While CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) and CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) could be considered as contributing factors, the primary weakness lies in the **lack of proper error handling**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **insufficient error handling** as the root cause of the vulnerability. The provided evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section strongly supports this: \"The vulnerability is due to insufficient error handling in the local malware analysis process of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software.\"\n\nCWE-755 (Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions) aligns best with this description. The retriever results also list CWE-755 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-400 and CWE-770 were considered but deemed less specific as they describe the resulting denial-of-service condition rather than the underlying cause. The graph relationships emphasize that these are related to resource management issues, which are consequences of the error handling problem.\n\nTherefore, CWE-755 is selected as the primary CWE due to its direct relevance to the root cause, supported by the vulnerability description and CVE reference details.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-404: Improper

is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product's resource pool is not large enough to handle peak demand, which allows an attacker to prevent others from accessing the resource by using a (relatively) large number of requests for resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, i.e., after the resource is no longer needed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 7280.29\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n-",
