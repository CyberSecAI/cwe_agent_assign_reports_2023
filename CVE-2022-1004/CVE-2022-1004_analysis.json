CWE-201 is more specific, but requires that the data is sent to another actor which may or may not be the case here. CWE-200 is a more general case of exposing sensitive information which fits the **impact** better, even if it is discouraged.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    \n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper** configuration setting enforcement, leading to **information disclosure** and ultimately a confidentiality breach.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the analysis focused on finding a precise CWE that captures the **root cause** of the vulnerability: the system's failure to properly enforce the `ExternalFrontend::TicketDetailView###AccountedTimeDisplay` configuration setting. The evidence suggests that the intended behavior was to prevent the display of accounted time, but the system **failed** to do so.\n\nThe Retriever Results pointed towards CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) and its child, CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data). While CWE-201 seemed initially promising, the description indicates it's about data being **sent** to another actor, and it's unclear whether merely displaying the information counts as \"sending\".\n\nCWE-200 is a high-level Class, and the guidance **discourages** its use, recommending more specific CWEs. However, given the **information disclosure** aspect and the **lack** of a lower-level CWE that perfectly captures the **root cause** (the configuration setting enforcement failure), CWE-200 seems like the most appropriate choice. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions that the system displays accounted time even when it's supposed to be disabled, indicating a failure to properly prevent **unauthorized access** to this information.\n\n*   \"Accounted time is shown in the Ticket Detail View (External Interface), even if ExternalFrontendTicketDetailView###AccountedTimeDisplay is disabled.\"\n\nThe **impact** is a \"Confidentiality Breach,\" as the vulnerability leads to the leakage of potentially sensitive information.\n\nOther considered CWEs:\n\n*   CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor): Considered, but the \"accounted time\" may not always be \"private personal information\".\n*   CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization): Too focused on authorization checks.\n\nUltimately, the selection of CWE-200 as the primary CWE, despite the discouragement, is based on the evidence of **information disclosure** combined with the **failure** to enforce the intended configuration.\nThe more specific CWE-201 has been added as the secondary candidate because it closely matches the **impact** of data in the Ticket Detail View being **sent** to another actor.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
