*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-256 [Plaintext Storage of a Password], is a Base level CWE that is a child of CWE-522 [Insufficiently Protected Credentials]. This parent-child relationship indicates that CWE-256 is a more specific instance of the broader class of insufficiently protected credentials. CWE-260 [Password in Configuration File] is also a child of CWE-522, and represents another possible base-level mapping.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is straightforward: The **root cause** is the **unencrypted storage of passwords**, leading to the impact where attackers can view these passwords if they have appropriate access.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis strongly points to CWE-256 [Plaintext Storage of a Password] as the primary weakness, due to the clear description of passwords being stored unencrypted.

The vulnerability description states that "Jenkins NS-ND Integration Performance Publisher Plugin 4.8.0.143 and earlier stores passwords **unencrypted** in job config.xml files on the Jenkins controller". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further reinforces this, stating the **root cause** is that the "NS-ND Integration Performance Publisher Plugin stores passwords in job `config.xml` files **without encryption**."

The retriever results also list CWE-256 as the top combined result. CWE-256 is a base level CWE, which is preferred.

CWE-522 [Insufficiently Protected Credentials] is a Class level CWE, which is less specific, but still applicable as the parent of CWE-256. I am including it as a secondary candidate.

CWE-260 [Password in Configuration File] is a base level CWE, and is a child of CWE-522. I am including it as a secondary candidate since the passwords are stored in the job config.xml file.

Based on the evidence, relationship analysis, and mapping guidance, CWE-256 is the most specific and appropriate CWE for this vulnerability.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.

### Extended Description
Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Depending on usage, this could be a weakness or a category. Further study of all its children is needed, and the entire sub-tree may need to be clarified.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.


Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.


When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to "sniff" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.

## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete
