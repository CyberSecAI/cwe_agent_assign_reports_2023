This parent-child relationship indicates that CWE-256 is a more specific instance of the broader class of insufficiently protected credentials. CWE-260 [Password in Configuration File] is also a child of CWE-522, and represents another possible base-level mapping.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe260[\"CWE-260: Password in Configuration File\"]\n    \n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe260 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe522,cwe260 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward: The **root cause** is the **unencrypted storage of passwords**, leading to the impact where attackers can view these passwords if they have appropriate access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points to CWE-256 [Plaintext Storage of a Password] as the primary weakness, due to the clear description of passwords being stored unencrypted.\n\nThe vulnerability description states that \"Jenkins NS-ND Integration Performance Publisher Plugin 4.8.0.143 and earlier stores passwords **unencrypted** in job config.xml files on the Jenkins controller\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further reinforces this, stating the **root cause** is that the \"NS-ND Integration Performance Publisher Plugin stores passwords in job `config.xml` files **without encryption**.\"\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-256 as the top combined result. CWE-256 is a base level CWE, which is preferred.\n\nCWE-522 [Insufficiently Protected Credentials] is a Class level CWE, which is less specific, but still applicable as the parent of CWE-256. I am including it as a secondary candidate.\n\nCWE-260 [Password in Configuration File] is a base level CWE, and is a child of CWE-522. I am including it as a secondary candidate since the passwords are stored in the job config.xml file.\n\nBased on the evidence, relationship analysis, and mapping guidance, CWE-256 is the most specific and appropriate CWE for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: CWE-312 is similar to CWE-256, but CWE-256 is specifically about passwords. The description mentions passwords specifically, so CWE-256 is a better fit.\n\n## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.\n**Rationale for considering**: This is a parent of CWE-256 and is more general.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: This CWE focuses on transmission, not storage.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: This CWE does not fit the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: While the password is in a file, the primary issue is that it is stored in plaintext.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: This CWE is about weak credentials, but the vulnerability is about storing them in plaintext.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: This CWE does not fit the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: This CWE is about hard-coded credentials, but the vulnerability is about storing them in plaintext.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: This CWE does not fit the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: This CWE does not fit the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 4051.13\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: This CWE focuses on transmission, not storage.\n\n## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 4029.35\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nStoring a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.\n**Rationale for selecting**: This is the primary CWE.\n\n## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 3986.72\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.\n**Rationale for considering**: This is a

an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: This CWE does not fit the
