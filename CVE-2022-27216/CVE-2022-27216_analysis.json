CWE-256 is a child of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials), which is a more general class-level CWE. CWE-260 (Password in Configuration File) is also a child of CWE-522 and is a peer of CWE-256, representing a similar but slightly different weakness. CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) is a more general case of storing sensitive information in cleartext. The choice of CWE-256 reflects the specific vulnerability: storing passwords in plaintext.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe260[\"CWE-260: Password in Configuration File\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe260 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe922\n    cwe922[\"CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe260,cwe312,cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **unencrypted storage of the password** in the configuration file (CWE-256). This leads to the impact of potential unauthorized access to the database, if an attacker gains access to the configuration file.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the following evidence: \"Jenkins dbCharts Plugin 0.5.2 and earlier stores JDBC connection passwords **unencrypted** in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller where they can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.\" and \"Root Cause: The dbCharts Plugin stores JDBC connection passwords in **cleartext** within its global configuration file (`hudson.plugins.dbcharts.DbChartPublisher.xml`) on the Jenkins controller.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by providing context on the hierarchy of weaknesses.
