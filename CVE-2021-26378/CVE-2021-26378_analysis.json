It is related to both CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) and CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as the improper index validation can lead to out-of-bounds memory access. The evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-1285 as the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1285[\"CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe1285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe125 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe1285\n    cwe787 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe1285\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1285 primary\n    class cwe20,cwe125,cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient bound checks** (CWE-1285), which leads to access to an invalid address space. Depending on whether the access is a read or a write, this results in either CWE-125 or CWE-787, ultimately causing a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the provided vulnerability description and CVE details, which clearly pointed to **insufficient bound checks** as the root cause. The description mentions that this leads to accessing an invalid address space, resulting in a denial of service. The primary focus was on identifying the most specific CWE that represents the lack of proper validation on input used as an index or offset.\n\nThe retriever results suggested several potential CWEs, including CWE-119, CWE-1285, CWE-823, and CWE-1284. While CWE-119 is a broader category, the description of **insufficient bound checks** and accessing invalid address space more precisely aligns with CWE-1285 (Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input). The CVE summary reinforces this by explicitly stating \"Insufficient bound checks in the System Management Unit (SMU).\"\n\nGiven the evidence and the definitions of the candidate CWEs, CWE-1285 is the most appropriate primary mapping. The potential for out-of-bounds reads or writes as a consequence supports the inclusion of CWE-125 and CWE-787 as secondary mappings. These selections are at the base level of abstraction, as recommended, and directly reflect the specific weakness described in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
