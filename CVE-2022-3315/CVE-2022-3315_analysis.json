It has a child relationship to CWE-704 [CWE-704: Improper Output Encoding for Attribute]. CWE-843 [CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')] can precede CWE-119 [CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer], indicating a potential overflow. CWE-787 [CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write] is another base-level CWE which is a parent to CWE-124 [CWE-124: Buffer Under-read].\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe843[\"CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe704[\"CWE-704: Improper Output Encoding for Attribute\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe124[\"CWE-124: Buffer Under-read\"]\n    \n    cwe843 -->|CHILDOF| cwe704\n    cwe843 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    cwe787 -->|PARENTOF| cwe124\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe843 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with a **type confusion** (**WEAKNESS**) in the Blink engine, potentially leading to heap corruption.\n  - The root cause is **confusion in Blink**.\n  - The **impact** is heap corruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the vulnerability description and the provided CVE reference links. The description explicitly states \"Type **confusion in Blink**\" and the CVE reference link confirms this. The primary CWE match from similar CVE descriptions is CWE-843 [CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')], further supporting this selection. The relationship analysis suggests a potential path from type confusion to out-of-bounds write. The final decision prioritizes the explicit mention of type confusion and its confirmation in the provided evidence.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"Type **confusion in Blink** in Google Chrome prior to 106.0.5249.62 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page. (Chromium security severity Low)\"\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"Type **confusion in Blink**.\"\n\nCWE-843 [CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')] is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability.
