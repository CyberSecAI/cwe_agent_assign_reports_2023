CWE-329 (**Generation of Predictable IV with CBC Mode**) is a variant of CWE-1204 and also a child of CWE-573 (**Use of Obsolete or Cryptographically Weak Algorithm**), representing a more specific scenario where the weak IV leads to predictability in CBC mode. The relationship between CWE-1204 and CWE-329 indicates a hierarchical structure, moving from a general weakness to a specific case.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1204[\"CWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)\"]\n    cwe329[\"CWE-329: Generation of Predictable IV with CBC Mode\"]\n    cwe573[\"CWE-573: Use of Obsolete or Cryptographically Weak Algorithm\"]\n    cwe330[\"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\"]\n\n    cwe329 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1204\n    cwe329 -->|CHILDOF| cwe573\n    cwe1204 -->|CHILDOF| cwe330\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1204 primary\n    class cwe329,cwe573,cwe330 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **randomly generated Initialization Vector (IV)** which leads to a **collision of IVs with the same key**, ultimately resulting in information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary, which clearly points to the weakness in generating IVs. The description states \"**randomly generated Initialization Vector (IV)** may lead to a **collision of IVs with the same key** potentially resulting in information disclosure.\" The evidence is strong, and the retriever results support the selection of CWE-1204.\n\nCWE-1204 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the **weakness** related to the generation of IVs. While CWE-329 is more specific, it's only applicable if the vulnerability is specifically within CBC mode, which is not explicitly mentioned in the description. Therefore, CWE-1204 is the more appropriate primary mapping.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a cryptographic primitive that uses an Initialization\n\t\t\tVector (IV), but the product does not generate IVs that are\n\t\t\tsufficiently unpredictable or unique according to the expected\n\t\t\tcryptographic requirements for that primitive.\n\t\t\t\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm or scheme that produces insufficient entropy, leaving patterns or clusters of values that are more likely to occur than others.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
