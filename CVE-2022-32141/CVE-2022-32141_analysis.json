CWE-126 is more specific and accurately captures the vulnerability. CWE-119 is a high-level class, making it less suitable.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe125\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe126 primary\n    class cwe125 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain involves crafting a request with an invalid offset, leading to a **buffer over-read**, and finally resulting in a denial-of-service condition. The root cause is the improper handling of the offset, leading to the **buffer over-read**, which is the primary weakness.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment points to a **buffer over-read** due to a crafted request with an invalid offset. The evidence directly supports CWE-126, Buffer Over-read, as the primary weakness. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states: \"- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\".\n\nThe relationship analysis highlights that CWE-126 is a variant of CWE-125, and both are children of the more general CWE-119. The mapping guidance for CWE-119 discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available. Since CWE-126 accurately describes the vulnerability, it is the most appropriate choice.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description, the retriever results, and the relationship analysis. CWE-126 is at the optimal level of specificity, providing a clear understanding of the **buffer over-read** vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following

0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction
