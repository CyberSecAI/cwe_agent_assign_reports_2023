This can then lead to CWE-787 **Out-of-bounds Write** because the allocated buffer is smaller than expected.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe131[\"CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe131 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe131\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe131,cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) when calculating the buffer size, leading to an **incorrect** buffer size calculation (CWE-131). This smaller-than-expected buffer then results in an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) during PAC parsing.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-190 **Integer Overflow or Wraparound** as this is the root cause of the vulnerability described. The vulnerability description states that there are \"**integer overflows** that may lead to remote code execution... on 32-bit platforms (which have a resultant heap-based buffer overflow), and cause a denial of service on other platforms\". The summary of the CVE Reference Links Content also confirms the **integer overflows** in PAC parsing. The secondary weaknesses include CWE-131 **Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size**, due to the **integer overflow**, and CWE-787 **Out-of-bounds Write** due to the **incorrect** buffer size.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**:
