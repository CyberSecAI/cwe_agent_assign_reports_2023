It has child CWEs that are more specific.\nCWE-863 is also a class-level CWE. It is related to authorization issues. It is a child of CWE-285 Improper Authorization which in turn is a child of CWE-284 Improper Access Control.\nCWE-200 is a child of CWE-668, Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284,cwe668 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **exposure vulnerability in ril property setting**. This allows unauthorized access to the `EF_RUIMID` value. This leads to the **impact:** access EF_RUIMID value without permission which is sensitive information exposure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence. The key phrases indicate an **exposure vulnerability** leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information. The CVE reference summary confirms this, highlighting the root cause as an information exposure issue in RIL property settings, specifically allowing access to the `EF_RUIMID` value without permission.\n\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-200, \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor.\" This aligns with the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary, which both explicitly state that the vulnerability results in the exposure of sensitive information (`EF_RUIMID`) to unauthorized actors. However, CWE-200 is discouraged because it is a high level class CWE.\n\nCWE-863, \"Incorrect Authorization,\" is considered as a secondary candidate. The vulnerability allows access to a value without proper permission, indicating a potential authorization issue. However, the primary issue is the exposure of sensitive information, making CWE-200 a more direct fit.\n\nThe selection of CWE-200 is at a class level. Ideally a base or variant level would be better. The provided information does not allow for a more specific CWE assignment, as the exact mechanism **allowing access without permission** is not elaborated in enough detail to select a more specific CWE. Given the available information, CWE-200 is the most appropriate choice.",
