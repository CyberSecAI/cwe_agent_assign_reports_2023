The kernel's **failure to limit or throttle** the allocation of shared memory segments leads to resource exhaustion and DoS. |\n| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. The **resource exhaustion** caused by the kernel's inefficient handling of shared memory segments. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-770, which is a base level weakness describing the allocation of resources without limits. CWE-400 is a class level weakness that describes uncontrolled resource consumption. CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400, making it a more specific classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **kernel's inefficient method of measuring shared memory usage** which doesn't scale with large shared memory segment counts. This leads to the **allocation of resources without limits or throttling** (CWE-770), which in turn results in **resource exhaustion** and ultimately a **Denial of Service (DoS)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the Linux kernel **fails to limit or throttle** the allocation of shared memory segments, leading to resource exhaustion and a Denial of Service (DoS). The primary CWE is CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling), which accurately reflects the root cause of the vulnerability. A secondary CWE, CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption), captures the impact of the vulnerability.\n\nThe evidence supporting this assessment is found in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states that \"The Linux kernel's method of measuring shared memory usage does not scale efficiently with a large number of shared memory segments,\" and that the weaknesses include \"Resource exhaustion\" and \"Denial of Service (DoS).\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the parent-child relationship between CWE-770 and CWE-400. CWE-770 is more specific and directly addresses the **lack of limits on resource allocation**, making it the primary CWE.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-770 is a Base level weakness, which is preferred for mapping root causes, and it accurately describes the kernel's **failure to impose restrictions on the number of shared memory segments that can be allocated**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
