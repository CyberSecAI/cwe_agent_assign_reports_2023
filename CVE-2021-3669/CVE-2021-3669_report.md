## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-770 | Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The kernel's **failure to limit or throttle** the allocation of shared memory segments leads to resource exhaustion and DoS. |
| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. The **resource exhaustion** caused by the kernel's inefficient handling of shared memory segments. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-770, which is a base level weakness describing the allocation of resources without limits. CWE-400 is a class level weakness that describes uncontrolled resource consumption. CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400, making it a more specific classification.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **kernel's inefficient method of measuring shared memory usage** which doesn't scale with large shared memory segment counts. This leads to the **allocation of resources without limits or throttling** (CWE-770), which in turn results in **resource exhaustion** and ultimately a **Denial of Service (DoS)**.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis indicates that the Linux kernel **fails to limit or throttle** the allocation of shared memory segments, leading to resource exhaustion and a Denial of Service (DoS). The primary CWE is CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling), which accurately reflects the root cause of the vulnerability. A secondary CWE, CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption), captures the impact of the vulnerability.

The evidence supporting this assessment is found in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states that "The Linux kernel's method of measuring shared memory usage does not scale efficiently with a large number of shared memory segments," and that the weaknesses include "Resource exhaustion" and "Denial of Service (DoS)."

The graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the parent-child relationship between CWE-770 and CWE-400. CWE-770 is more specific and directly addresses the **lack of limits on resource allocation**, making it the primary CWE.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-770 is a Base level weakness, which is preferred for mapping root causes, and it accurately describes the kernel's **failure to impose restrictions on the number of shared memory segments that can be allocated**.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is "asymmetric."

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, i.e., after the resource is no longer needed.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly restrict reading from or writing to dynamically-managed code resources such as variables, objects, classes, attributes, functions, or executable instructions or statements.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 6831.14
