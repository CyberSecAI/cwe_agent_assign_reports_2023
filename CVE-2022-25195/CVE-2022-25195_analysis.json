CWE-284 is a high-level pillar, while CWE-285 is a class. CWE-862 offers more specificity than its parents, as it explicitly highlights the absence of an authorization check. The relationship analysis helped refine the selection from the more general CWE-285 to the specific CWE-862.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n    class cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission check** (CWE-862), which allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials. The chain consists of:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing Authorization** (CWE-862)\n2.  **Impact:** Ability to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials, potentially capturing credentials.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **missing permission check** as the core weakness. The vulnerability description and CVE details clearly state that the Jenkins plugin **does not perform a permission check**, enabling unauthorized access.\n\nThe retriever results suggested CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) as the top candidate. The relationship analysis confirmed that CWE-862 is a more specific child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), making it a better fit.\n\nThe final decision to select CWE-862 is based on the explicit evidence of a **missing permission check**, aligning perfectly with the CWE's description. While CWE-285 could also apply, CWE-862 provides greater specificity and is therefore preferred.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is: \"A **missing permission check** in Jenkins autonomiq Plugin 1.15 and earlier allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials.\"\n\nThe CVE reference summary states: \"autonomiq Plugin 1.15 and earlier **does not perform a permission check** in an HTTP endpoint.\"\n\nThese excerpts provide direct evidence supporting the selection of CWE-862.\n\nThe CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **missing permission check**, rather than a more general authorization issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason for not selecting:* The description indicates that there is a **missing permission check**, not that the access control is not granular enough.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n*Reason for not selecting:* The root cause is a **missing permission check**, not that the product improperly handles insufficient privileges.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.

However, classification research is limited for weaknesses of this type, so there can be gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE that force use of this weakness, even at such a high level of abstraction.\n\n*Reason for not selecting:* The root cause is a **missing permission check**, not a general issue with control flow management.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason for not selecting:* The root cause is a **missing permission check**, not an authorization bypass",
