Also, CWE-1333 can lead to uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400), as an inefficient regex can consume excessive CPU. CWE-400 is a child of CWE-665 (Improper Control of Resource Consumption) which in turn is a child of CWE-400. The chosen CWE is at the optimal base level of abstraction.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    cwe1333 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe407 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **inefficient regular expression complexity** (CWE-1333), which leads to excessive CPU consumption, ultimately resulting in **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400) and a denial-of-service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, particularly the **vulnerability description** key phrases and the CVE reference links content summary, which explicitly mentions \"Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to a poorly constructed regular expression\" and \"excessive CPU consumption\".\n\nThe selection of CWE-1333 is based on its direct match to the ReDoS vulnerability caused by the inefficient regular expression. The retriever results also strongly support this, with CWE-1333 having the highest score. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-1333 is a specific type of algorithmic complexity issue (CWE-407), further solidifying its relevance. The description clearly indicates that the regular expression's inefficiency leads to denial of service due to excessive CPU usage, so CWE-400 is considered as well.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-1333 is a base-level CWE that directly addresses the root cause, while CWE-400 captures the broader impact of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-625: Permissive Regular Expression\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a regular expression that does not sufficiently restrict the set of allowed values.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-185: Incorrect Regular Expression\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product specifies a regular expression in a way that causes data to be improperly matched or compared.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-186: Overly Restrictive Regular Expression\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA regular expression is overly restrictive, which prevents dangerous values from being detected.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
