The software then fails to neutralize special elements in the input, leading to **SQL Injection** (CWE-89), which can then lead to the modification of SQL queries.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the issue is an **Improper Input Validation** vulnerability that allows **SQL Injection**. The primary CWE match from similar CVE descriptions is CWE-89 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')]. The retriever results also list CWE-89 as the top combined result.\n\nThe vulnerability description provides strong evidence of both **Improper Input Validation** and **SQL Injection**, making CWE-89 the most appropriate primary CWE. While **Improper Input Validation** is mentioned, CWE-20 [Improper Input Validation] is a class-level CWE and is discouraged from being used directly when a more specific weakness is known. Since **SQL Injection** is the direct result of the **improper input validation**, CWE-89 is more specific and appropriate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- CWE-89: This CWE is a Base level weakness that perfectly describes the vulnerability, where the software constructs an SQL command using externally-influenced input but does not neutralize special elements. The MITRE mapping guidance allows its usage.\n- CWE-20: While **improper input validation** is mentioned in the description, this CWE is a Class level and is discouraged. The description explicitly states that the vulnerability allows **SQL Injection**, so CWE-89 is more appropriate.\n\nBased on the evidence and the CWE specifications, CWE-89 is the primary CWE, with a confidence level of 1.0. CWE-20 is a secondary candidate.",
