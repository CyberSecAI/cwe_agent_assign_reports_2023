Its parent CWE is CWE-285, Improper Authorization, also a Class-level CWE. A more specific Base-level CWE would be ideal, but the description focuses on the absence of authorization checks. CWE-306, Missing Authentication for Critical Function, is considered as a related CWE, but authentication isn't explicitly mentioned, making authorization more relevant. CWE-425, Direct Request ('Forced Browsing'), is a potential consequence of missing authorization but isn't the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe306,cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with **missing access control**, which leads to potential unauthorized access to resources. This is represented by CWE-862, Missing Authorization. A potential consequence of missing authorization is CWE-425, Direct Request ('Forced Browsing').\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **missing access control** as the primary weakness. The retriever results suggested CWE-862, Missing Authorization, as a strong candidate. The description explicitly mentions **missing access control**, and CWE-862 accurately captures this. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-862 is a child of the more general CWE-285, Improper Authorization. While a base CWE would be more appropriate, the current evidence supports CWE-862 as the primary weakness.\n\nThe selection is based on the vulnerability description's key phrase: \"**rootcause:** **missing access control**\".\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was considered but not selected as the vulnerability specifically highlights the *absence* of access control rather than an incorrect implementation. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) was also considered, but it's a high-level Pillar, and CWE-862 is a more specific Class.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
