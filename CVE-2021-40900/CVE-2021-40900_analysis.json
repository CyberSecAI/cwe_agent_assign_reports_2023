The vulnerability involves an inefficient regular expression, making CWE-1333 the most specific and appropriate choice. Other CWEs like CWE-777 (Regular Expression without Anchors) and CWE-185 (Incorrect Regular Expression) were considered but are less directly related to the core issue of inefficient complexity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe407 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the use of an **inefficient regular expression** (CWE-1333). This leads to excessive CPU consumption when processing specially crafted inputs, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the associated CVE reference content summary. The key phrase \"Regular Expression Denial of Service\" and the description of the **weakness** as being due to \"inefficient regular expressions used for email validation\" strongly support the selection of CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity). The provided information explicitly states that the library uses regular expressions that can lead to catastrophic backtracking, which aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-1333.\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-1333 is a specific type of CWE-407 (Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity), making it the optimal choice.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: the inefficient complexity of the regular expression.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were
