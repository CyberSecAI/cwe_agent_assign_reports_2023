CWE-770 is a base-level CWE, providing a more specific description of the vulnerability than CWE-400. CWE-789 is a variant of CWE-770, representing an even more specific scenario, but the description provided does not give enough information to indicate if the memory allocation is based on an explicit size value.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe789 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of HTTP requests with large bodies** which leads to **excessive memory consumption**, eventually causing a **denial of service**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-770 as the primary candidate, with CWE-400 and CWE-789 as secondary considerations. The final decision was based on the evidence available and the CWE specifications.\n\nThe vulnerability description states that the Cloud AdmissionController is susceptible to a DoS attack because it does not properly handle HTTP requests with large bodies. This results in **memory exhaustion** and a denial of service.\n\nCWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is the most appropriate because the system allocates resources without imposing restrictions on the size, leading to a violation of the intended security policy. \"The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.\"\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a broader class of weakness and is discouraged as per MITRE mapping guidance, but it could still apply. \"The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\"\n\nCWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) is a more specific variant of CWE-770, where memory allocation is based on an untrusted, large size value. However, the description doesn't explicitly state that the size value is untrusted or excessively large, so this is not the best fit. \"The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\"\n\nUltimately, CWE-770 is chosen as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: the lack of limits on resource allocation. The confidence level is high due to clear evidence and alignment with CWE specifications and mapping guidance.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\nThis CWE was not selected as it focuses on asymmetric resource consumption, which isn't the primary issue.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis CWE was not selected as it's about sensitive information exposure, not resource exhaustion.\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\nThis CWE was not selected as the focus is on the size of the request body, not the frequency of requests.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\nThis CWE was not selected as it's about improper release, not allocation.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
