It is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). There are no other relationships that significantly influence the selection in this case, as the provided information is sufficient to directly map to CWE-120.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe120 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **buffer copy without checking size of input** (CWE-120) leading to memory corruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the root cause is a **buffer copy without checking size of input**, which directly corresponds to CWE-120. The description also notes the impact as memory corruption.\n\nThe evidence is:\n\"Memory corruption due to **buffer copy without checking size of input** in modem while receiving WMI_REQUEST_STATS_CMDID command.\"\n\nCWE-120 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level. The mapping guidance allows it with review, emphasizing its applicability to \"Buffer Copy\" operations without input size checking.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-120 as the top candidate.\n\nThe other CWEs were considered, but none matched as directly as CWE-120. For example, CWE-190 (Integer Overflow) and CWE-124 (Buffer Underwrite) are related to buffer overflows but do not describe the root cause of copying without checking size. CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size) could be a factor, but the description doesn't specify this.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-680: Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation to determine how much memory to allocate, but an integer overflow can occur that causes less memory to be allocated than expected, leading to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a named chain, which combines multiple weaknesses.\n\n\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
