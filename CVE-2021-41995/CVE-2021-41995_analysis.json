This relationship indicates that CWE-780 is a more specific case of using a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm. The vulnerability description mentions a \"**misconfiguration of RSA**\" which directly relates to the use of the RSA algorithm without proper padding (OAEP).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe780[\"CWE-780: Use of RSA Algorithm without OAEP\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    \n    cwe780 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe780 primary\n    class cwe327 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Misconfiguration of RSA** due to missing OAEP padding.\n2.  **Weakness:** Vulnerability to pre-computed dictionary attacks.\n3.  **Impact:** Offline MFA bypass.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the \"**misconfiguration of RSA**\" and the resulting \"offline MFA bypass.\" The primary match from the Retriever Results was CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values), however, this CWE does not fit the vulnerability well. CWE-780 (Use of RSA Algorithm without OAEP) is a better fit, as it directly addresses the **misconfiguration** related to the RSA algorithm. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"RSA\" and the lack of proper configuration leads to the bypass.\n\nWhile CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) could be considered a broader category, CWE-780 is more specific and directly relates to the RSA algorithm and its **misconfiguration**.\n\nThe evidence supporting CWE-780 is the vulnerability description stating \"**misconfiguration of RSA**\" and the vulnerability to \"pre-computed dictionary attacks, leading to an offline MFA bypass\".
