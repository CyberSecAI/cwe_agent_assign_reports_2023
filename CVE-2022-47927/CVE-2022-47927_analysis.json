CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions) is a child of CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource). While CWE-732 is broader, the vulnerability clearly stems from the MediaWiki installer setting **incorrect default permissions** for SQLite files, making CWE-276 a more precise classification.\nCWE-552 (Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties) was considered as a peer, as the final result is that the files are accessible to external parties, but it does not describe the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe276[\"CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe552[\"CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\"]\n\n    cwe276 -->|CHILDOF| cwe732\n    cwe552 -- PeerOf -- cwe732\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe276 primary\n    class cwe732 secondary\n    class cwe552 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a pre-existing data directory having **weak permissions**. The MediaWiki installer then creates SQLite files with world-readable permissions due to not setting proper default permissions. This leads to information leakage and potential further attacks due to the exposure of sensitive data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability and selecting the most appropriate CWE. The vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly pointed to the MediaWiki installer creating SQLite database files with world-readable permissions (mode 644).\n\nThe Retriever Results listed CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) and CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions) as potential candidates.\n\nThe final decision was to select CWE-276 as the primary CWE because it accurately reflects the **root cause**: the **incorrect default permissions** being set during installation. CWE-732 is a broader, class-level CWE, while CWE-276 is a more specific, base-level CWE, which is preferred.\n\nThe choice is heavily based on the following evidence:\n- Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: \"**weakness:** **weak permissions**\"\n- CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"The vulnerability stems from the MediaWiki installer creating SQLite database files with world-readable permissions (mode 644) when a pre-existing data directory with lax permissions is used.\"\n- CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"The fix involves modifying the MediaWiki installation process to ensure SQLite database files are created with mode 600 (read/write for the owner only) instead of 644.\"\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nOpening temporary files without appropriate measures or controls can leave the file, its contents and any function that it impacts vulnerable to attack.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
