While confidentiality loss is an impact, the root cause is how the application manages access to sensitive information. Although discouraged, it seems the most appropriate given the provided context. |\n| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | The vulnerability description indicates that messages from private channels and direct messages are disclosed **regardless** of the user's access permission, which suggests a potential lack of authorization checks. This is a potential secondary weakness. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-200, which is a Class-level weakness. It has child CWEs like CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) and CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor). The secondary CWE candidate is CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), which is also a Class-level weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    \n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing** or **incorrect** authorization check, leading to the **exposure of sensitive information**.\n  - **Root Cause:** Missing or incorrect authorization check (potentially CWE-862 or CWE-863)\n  - **Weakness:** **Information Disclosure** due to **improper** access control.\n  - **Impact:** Messages from private channels and direct messages are disclosed **regardless** of user's access permissions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **information disclosure** aspect of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description states that the `getUserMentionsByChannel` meteor server method discloses messages from private channels and direct messages **regardless** of the users access permission to the room. This clearly indicates an **information disclosure** (**weakness**) vulnerability.\n\nThe Retriever results also suggest CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) as the top candidate. However, CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE and is often misused. The mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available.\n\nThe presence of missing authorization is implied, suggesting CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) or CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). However, the evidence does not explicitly state that authorization is missing or incorrect, but rather that the disclosure happens **regardless** of permissions.\n\nTherefore, the primary CWE is CWE-200, as it directly relates to the **information disclosure** caused by the **improper** handling of access permissions. A secondary CWE could be CWE-862, as the **disclosure** happens **regardless** of user permissions.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-213: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product's intended functionality exposes information to certain actors in accordance with the developer's security policy, but this information is regarded as sensitive according to the intended security policies of other stakeholders such as the product's administrator, users, or others whose information is being processed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
