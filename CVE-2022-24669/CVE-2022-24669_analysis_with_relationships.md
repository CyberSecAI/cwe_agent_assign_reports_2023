# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information | 0.8 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-497 | Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary classification is CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information], which is a class-level CWE. Several base-level CWEs are children of CWE-200, which were also considered. CWE-497 [Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere] and CWE-213 [Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies] are both children of CWE-200 and were considered as secondary classifications because they represent more specific aspects of the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **well-crafted attack** that leads to the **impact** of gaining details of the deployment. This exposure can then be used to probe internal network services. The chain is:
1.  **Well-crafted attack**
2.  **Exposure of Sensitive Information** (CWE-200)
3.  Probing of internal network services

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description indicates that an attacker can gain details of the deployment through a **well-crafted attack**. This information may then be used to probe internal network services. The key aspect is the **exposure of sensitive information**, which aligns with CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information].

The retriever results suggest several candidate CWEs, including CWE-923 [Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints], CWE-502 [Deserialization of Untrusted Data], CWE-918 [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)], CWE-285 [Improper Authorization], CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function], and CWE-213 [Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies]. However, most of these do not directly address the core issue of information exposure.

CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information] is a class-level CWE, and while it is generally preferred to use base or variant-level CWEs, in this case, the provided information does not give enough details to narrow it down to a more specific CWE. CWE-497 [Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere] is a child of CWE-200, and is included because the description mentions details of the deployment, which can be considered system information. CWE-213 [Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies] is also a child of CWE-200, which relates to the developer's security policy exposing information that is considered sensitive by other stakeholders.

The decision to use CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information] as the primary CWE is based on the vulnerability description's explicit mention of gaining details of the deployment. The other candidate CWEs either address different types of vulnerabilities or are too specific given the limited information available.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-213: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product's intended functionality exposes information to certain actors in accordance with the developer's security policy, but this information is regarded as sensitive according to the intended security policies of other stakeholders such as the product's administrator, users, or others whose information is being processed.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**:
