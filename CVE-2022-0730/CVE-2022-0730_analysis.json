CWE-287 is a parent of CWE-1390. The vulnerability involves bypassing authentication via a specific configuration (anonymous binding), which makes CWE-289 more appropriate than its parents.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe289[\"CWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe289 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe1390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe289 primary\n    class cwe1390,cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain involves a specific LDAP configuration (**anonymous binding enabled**) leading to an **authentication bypass**, resulting in **unauthorized access**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the authentication bypass. The description clearly states that under certain LDAP conditions, Cacti authentication can be bypassed. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the **root cause** is related to **improper handling of anonymous binding** in the LDAP configuration.\n\nCWE-289, Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name, closely matches this scenario, as the anonymous binding essentially provides an alternate name/path for authentication.\n\nCWE-1390, Weak Authentication, is a broader category but still applicable as a secondary CWE, since the authentication mechanism is weak due to the LDAP configuration.\n\nCWE-287, Improper Authentication, is also considered but discouraged because it's a high-level class and more specific CWEs exist.\n\nThe evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary supports this: \"The vulnerability is a result of **improper handling of anonymous binding**.\"\n\nThe graph relationships guided the selection towards CWE-289, as it's a more specific child of the more general CWE-1390. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-289 accurately describes the specific bypass mechanism (alternate name via anonymous binding), while CWE-1390 provides a broader context of weak authentication.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-305:
