This is often preceded by an integer overflow (CWE-190) when calculating buffer sizes, which is a possible cause here and a secondary weakness. CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), but CWE-787 is more specific and therefore preferred.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe190 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a possible **CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound** when calculating the size of the heap buffer, leading to a **CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write** condition. This then allows for code execution as the impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly suggests CWE-787 due to the explicit mention of a \"**heap-based buffer overflow**\" in the vulnerability description. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" further confirms this by stating \"A heap-based buffer overflow in `DecoderStream::Append` due to an integer overflow when calculating the size of the heap buffer.\" This is strong evidence of an out-of-bounds write condition.\n\nThe description also suggests that an integer overflow could have caused the incorrect buffer size calculation. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section supports the possibility of an integer overflow.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision to include CWE-190 as a secondary weakness, as it can precede CWE-787 in a vulnerability chain.\n\nCWE-787 is chosen because it directly reflects the **rootcause** \"heap-based buffer overflow\". While CWE-119 is a parent, it is too general. CWE-787 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base). CWE-190 is included as a likely contributing factor (an integer overflow when calculating the buffer size)\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-127: Buffer Under-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations prior to the targeted buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
