## Vulnerability Chain
The chain starts with a valid user authenticating with two-factor authentication. This user then manipulates their account in a way that exploits an **improper handling** of the two-factor authentication status, leading to a bypass of two-factor authentication on subsequent logins. The **root cause** is the **improper handling** of the two-factor authentication status, and the impact is the bypass of two-factor authentication.

## Summary of Analysis
Initially, I considered CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and its children, but the core issue here isn't necessarily a completely broken authentication scheme, but rather a flaw in how the application handles the state of two-factor authentication for an already authenticated user. The CVE description and summary mention "manipulate their account to bypass two-factor authentication" and "Improper Processing of User's 2FA Status," indicating that the application's logic around 2FA status is flawed.

The assigned CWE in the provided information is CWE-661. The description of the CVE also fits the description of CWE-661 since it states the application does not properly handle a specific user action sequence, allowing a bypass of the 2FA mechanism.

Based on the provided evidence, I've selected CWE-661 as the primary CWE.
CWE-287 is a secondary candidate since there is an authentication bypass involved.

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin 4.9 before 4.9.8 and 5.1 before 5.1.2. A valid user who is already authenticated to phpMyAdmin can manipulate their account to bypass two-factor authentication for future login instances.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** bypass two-factor authentication
- **vector:** manipulate account
- **attacker:** authenticated user
- **product:** phpMyAdmin
- **version:** 4.9 before 4.9.8 and 5.1 before 5.1.2

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23807:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in a sequence of actions a valid user can take that allows them to bypass two-factor authentication. A user has to first connect to phpMyAdmin (using their two-factor authentication method), which prepares their account for the bypass.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Two-Factor Authentication Bypass:** The core vulnerability is that the application does not properly handle a specific user action sequence, allowing a bypass of the 2FA mechanism. This bypass can occur after a user has already authenticated with 2FA.
- **Improper Processing of User's 2FA Status:** The application has an unintentional security weakness in how it processes a user's two-factor status, which enables the bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker who has already authenticated through 2FA can perform actions to bypass the 2FA on subsequent connections.
- It's important to note that an attacker can also disable 2FA via legitimate methods, which makes this bypass less critical.

**Attack Vectors:**

- A user must first authenticate using their valid 2FA method before the vulnerability can be exploited.
- After the initial authentication, a specific sequence of actions enables the bypass.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Valid User Credentials:** The attacker must be a valid user with an existing account and has already authenticated with 2FA.
- **Initial Access:** Requires prior legitimate access to the application using a valid 2FA method to prepare their account for the bypass.
- **Knowledge of the Specific Actions:** The attacker needs to know the specific sequence of actions required to trigger the bypass.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is considered "not severe" due to the specific conditions needed for exploitation, as an attacker must first authenticate to prepare their account and can disable 2FA through conventional methods as well.
- The issue is fixed in phpMyAdmin versions 4.9.8 and 5.1.2, and later.
- The assigned CWE is CWE-661 which relates to the improper handling of a switch in the application.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-943

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Factors: resultant to special character mismanagement, MAID, or denylist/allowlist problems. Can be primary to authentication and verification errors.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-41232:** Chain: authentication routine in Go-based agile development product does not escape user name (CWE-116), allowing LDAP injection (CWE-90)
- **CVE-2005-2301:** Server does not properly escape LDAP queries, which allows remote attackers to cause a DoS and possibly conduct an LDAP injection attack.




## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

### Extended Description


Retrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.


For example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.


One manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.


### Alternative Terms
Insecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The "Insecure Direct Object Reference" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.
Broken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.
Horizontal Authorization: "Horizontal Authorization" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-36539:** An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.




## CWE-620: Unverified Password Change
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When setting a new password for a user, the product does not require knowledge of the original password, or using another form of authentication.

### Extended Description
This could be used by an attacker to change passwords for another user, thus gaining the privileges associated with that user.

### Alternative Terms
None

## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
According to WASC, "Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization."

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.
