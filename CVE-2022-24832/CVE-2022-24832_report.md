## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-90 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection') | 1 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-116 | Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output | 0.9 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-90, which represents the direct LDAP injection vulnerability. CWE-116 is related as it describes the **improper encoding or escaping** that leads to the injection. CWE-116 can precede CWE-90 in a chain, as **improper escaping** often sets the stage for injection vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper input escaping** (likely related to CWE-116), leading to the ability to construct and execute malicious LDAP queries (CWE-90), ultimately allowing an attacker to deduce information about other users or entries within the LDAP database.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-90 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')). The vulnerability description and CVE reference summary clearly indicate that the GoCD LDAP authentication plugin fails to properly neutralize special elements in the username input when constructing LDAP queries. This allows a malicious user to inject arbitrary LDAP code, leading to potential information disclosure.

Supporting Evidence:
*   Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: "**rootcause: improper input escaping**", "**impact: construct and execute malicious LDAP queries**"
*   CVE Reference Links Content Summary: "The vulnerability stems from the `gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin` failing to properly sanitize user-provided usernames before constructing LDAP queries...**LDAP Injection:** The core weakness is an LDAP injection vulnerability. The plugin doesn't escape or encode special characters within usernames when building LDAP search filters, leading to the possibility of crafting arbitrary LDAP queries."

CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output) is a secondary CWE. The CVE reference summary states, "The fix in the plugin involves escaping/encoding the values when building the search filters.". The **improper escaping** is the root cause that allows the LDAP injection. CWE-116 is a Class, and a more specific Base or Variant might exist, but insufficient evidence is available to determine the specific escaping issue.

I considered other CWEs from the Retriever Results, such as CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), but these are higher-level Classes that don't accurately capture the specific weakness of LDAP injection due to **improper escaping**.

CWE-90 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) as it directly describes the LDAP injection vulnerability. The evidence supports this classification with high confidence.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 6473.20
