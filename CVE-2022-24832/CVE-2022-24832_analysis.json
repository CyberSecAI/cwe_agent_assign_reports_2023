CWE-116 is related as it describes the **improper encoding or escaping** that leads to the injection. CWE-116 can precede CWE-90 in a chain, as **improper escaping** often sets the stage for injection vulnerabilities.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe90[\"CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n    cwe943[\"CWE-943: Improper Neutralization Across a Trust Boundary\"]\n\n    cwe90 -->|CHILDOF| cwe943\n    cwe116 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe90\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe90 primary\n    class cwe116 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input escaping** (likely related to CWE-116), leading to the ability to construct and execute malicious LDAP queries (CWE-90), ultimately allowing an attacker to deduce information about other users or entries within the LDAP database.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-90 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')). The vulnerability description and CVE reference summary clearly indicate that the GoCD LDAP authentication plugin fails to properly neutralize special elements in the username input when constructing LDAP queries. This allows a malicious user to inject arbitrary LDAP code, leading to potential information disclosure.\n\nSupporting Evidence:\n*   Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: \"**rootcause: improper input escaping**\", \"**impact: construct and execute malicious LDAP queries**\"\n*   CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"The vulnerability stems from the `gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin` failing to properly sanitize user-provided usernames before constructing LDAP queries...**LDAP Injection:** The core weakness is an LDAP injection vulnerability. The plugin doesn't escape or encode special characters within usernames when building LDAP search filters, leading to the possibility of crafting arbitrary LDAP queries.\"\n\nCWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output) is a secondary CWE. The CVE reference summary states, \"The fix in the plugin involves escaping/encoding the values when building the search filters.\". The **improper escaping** is the root cause that allows the LDAP injection. CWE-116 is a Class, and a more specific Base or Variant might exist, but insufficient evidence is available to determine the specific escaping issue.\n\nI considered other CWEs from the Retriever Results, such as CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), but these are higher-level Classes that don't accurately capture the specific weakness of LDAP injection due to **improper escaping**.\n\nCWE-90 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) as it directly describes the LDAP injection vulnerability. The evidence supports this classification with high confidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this

0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n-
