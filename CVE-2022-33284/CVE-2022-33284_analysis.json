Since the description specifically mentions \"**buffer over-read**,\" the more specific variant CWE-126 was chosen over the base CWE-125.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe788[\"CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After the End of a Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe125\n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe788\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe126 primary\n    class cwe125,cwe788 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  A WLAN parsing routine attempts to process a BTM action frame.\n2.  Due to a **buffer over-read**, the routine reads data beyond the allocated buffer.\n3.  This leads to information disclosure.\n\nThe root cause is the **buffer over-read**, and the impact is information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states \"**buffer over-read**\" as the root cause of the information disclosure. The Retriever Results also list CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read) as the top candidate.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision is the \"**rootcause:** **buffer over-read**\" phrase in the Vulnerability Description Key Phrases section.\n\nCWE-126 (Buffer Over-read) is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is the preferred level for mapping. The description of CWE-126 accurately reflects the vulnerability: \"The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\"\n\nCWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) was considered but deemed less specific than CWE-126. CWE-125 is a parent of CWE-126, and since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions an \"over-read,\" CWE-126 is the more appropriate choice.\n\nThe other CWEs listed in the Retriever Results (CWE-190, CWE-193, CWE-1284, CWE-805, CWE-1339, CWE-909, CWE-122, CWE-908) were not selected because they do not directly address the **buffer over-read** issue.\nSpecifically, these are the reasons for exclusion:\n\n*   CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound): Relates to integer calculations, not buffer access.\n*   CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error): Could lead to a buffer over-read but is not the direct cause described.\n*   CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input): Involves quantity validation, which is not mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n*   CWE-805 (Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value): While related to buffer access, the description specifies that the access occurs because of an incorrect length value, not that the memory locations after the targeted buffer are read.\n*   CWE-1339 (Insufficient Precision or Accuracy of a Real Number): Pertains to real number precision, not buffer handling.\n*   CWE-909 (Missing Initialization of Resource): Addresses missing initialization, which is not the issue here.\n*   CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow): Specific to heap memory, while the description doesn't mention the memory location.\n*   CWE-908 (Use of Uninitialized Resource): Focuses on using uninitialized resources, not buffer over-reads.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-226:
