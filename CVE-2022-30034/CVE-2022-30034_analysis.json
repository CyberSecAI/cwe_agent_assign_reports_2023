Additionally, the observed example in CWE-1390 includes CVE-2022-30034, the CVE being analyzed. The vulnerability involves an authentication bypass due to a flaw in the email validation regex, thus fitting the description of CWE-305.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe305[\"CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe305 -->|ChildOf| cwe1390\n    cwe1390 -->|ChildOf| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe305 primary\n    class cwe1390 secondary\n    class cwe287 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insecure regex** used for email validation, leading to an **OAuth authentication bypass**. This allows an attacker to access the Flower API, potentially leading to arbitrary Celery RPC call execution or denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified several candidate CWEs, including CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) and CWE-305 (Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness). The final decision favors CWE-305 due to the specific nature of the bypass, which stems from a flaw in the email validation regex (**insecure regex**). This aligns with CWE-305's description of \"Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness,\" where the authentication algorithm itself isn't fundamentally flawed, but a separate weakness allows for the bypass. CWE-1390 remains a valid secondary consideration as it represents the broader class of authentication weaknesses. The presence of CVE-2022-30034 as an observed example in CWE-1390 further supports this selection.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision is primarily found in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" which states, \"The regular expression used to validate user emails during OAuth login lacked regex anchors, allowing attackers to bypass the intended email domain restrictions.\" This explicitly describes a bypass due to a flawed regex, aligning perfectly with CWE-305.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-305 is a Base level CWE that directly addresses the root cause: an authentication bypass caused by a primary weakness (the flawed regex). While CWE-1390 is a Class level CWE and thus less specific, it is still relevant as a broader categorization of the **weakness** and is included as a secondary candidate.\n\nRelevant CWE
