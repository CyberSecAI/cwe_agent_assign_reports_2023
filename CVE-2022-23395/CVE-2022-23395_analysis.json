It can also precede CWE-471 (Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data). CWE-79, a Base CWE, is a parent of several other CWEs related to XSS. The choice of CWE-1321 is based on the vulnerability description explicitly mentioning \"prototype pollution,\" which aligns directly with CWE-1321's description. CWE-79 is considered as a secondary candidate due to the impact (DOM XSS) but is less specific than CWE-1321 in terms of root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1321[\"CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\"]\n    cwe915[\"CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Identified Code\"]\n    cwe471[\"CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe1321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe915\n    cwe1321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    cwe1321 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe471\n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1321 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n    class cwe915,cwe913,cwe471,cwe74 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **prototype pollution** (CWE-1321), which leads to the ability to modify object prototypes. This modification can then lead to DOM cross-site scripting (XSS). The chain is: CWE-1321 -> DOM XSS.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause and the resulting impact. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**prototype pollution**\", which is the key indicator for CWE-1321. The impact, DOM XSS, suggests CWE-79, but CWE-1321 more accurately describes the root cause.\n\nThe assessment is primarily based on the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states that jQuery Cookie 1.4.1 is affected by **prototype pollution**, which can lead to DOM cross-site scripting (XSS).\n\nThe graph relationships further solidified the selection of CWE-1321, as it is directly related to the **modification of object prototypes**, which is the **root cause** described in the vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1321 is at the optimal level of specificity because it is a Variant that directly addresses the specific type of weakness present in the vulnerability: **improperly controlled modification of object prototype attributes**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n*   **CWE-1321:** Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\n    *   This is the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**prototype pollution**\".\n*   **CWE-79:** Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n    *   This is a secondary CWE because the impact of the vulnerability is DOM cross-site scripting. It is a consequence of the prototype pollution.\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - This was considered because XSS is sometimes related to CSRF, but the provided information does not suggest CSRF is involved.\n*   CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS) - This is too specific to HTML tags, while the XSS in this vulnerability is DOM-based.\n*   CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag - This is related to cookie security, but the vulnerability does not mention anything about cookies.\n*   CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID) - While prototype pollution does modify assumed-immutable data, CWE-1321 is a more specific variant that describes the weakness more accurately.\n*   CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output - While encoding/escaping can prevent XSS, the root cause is prototype pollution, so this is not the primary weakness.\n*   CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type - This is related to file uploads, which is not relevant to the described vulnerability.\n*   CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs - This is related to incomplete input validation, but it doesn't directly relate to the **prototype pollution** issue.",
