CWE-326 is a Class level CWE, and the mapping guidance suggests examining children for a better fit.

The description states that the **encryption** used is **weak**, and this allows an attacker to decipher it. While CWE-326 is a Class-level CWE, there isn't a more specific Base or Variant that fits better based on the information available.",
