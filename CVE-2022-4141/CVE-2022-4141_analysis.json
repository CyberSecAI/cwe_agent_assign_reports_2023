CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-787, specifying the location of the buffer overflow as the heap.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe788[\"CWE-788: Access of Resource Using Inappropriate Permission\"]\n    \n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe788\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe122 primary\n    class cwe787,cwe788 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a crafted substitute command, leading to the **heap-based buffer overflow** due to **invalid memory access** when `CTRL-W gf` is used in the expression.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the provided **Vulnerability Description** and **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**. The key phrase \"**Heap based buffer overflow**\" immediately suggested CWE-122. The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** section confirmed this by detailing an **invalid memory access** scenario caused by using `CTRL-W gf` in the substitute command, which jumps to a different file without proper lock checking. The fix involved adding a check for text locks, which further supports the buffer overflow classification.\n\nThe Retriever Results listed CWE-122 as a candidate and the Complete CWE Specifications confirmed that CWE-122 accurately describes the vulnerability. The mapping guidance for CWE-122 is \"Allowed\" and it is at the Variant level of abstraction, making it a preferred level of abstraction.\n\nOther CWEs considered included:\n\n*   CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer): This is a more general class, and CWE-122 provides a more specific description (heap-based). The mapping guidance for CWE-119 is \"Discouraged.\"\n*   CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound): While integer overflows can lead to buffer overflows, there is no evidence of an integer overflow in the description.\n*   CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read): The vulnerability is a write, not a read.\n*   CWE-124 (Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')): The vulnerability is an overflow, not an underflow.\n*   CWE-786 (Access of Memory Location Before Start of Buffer): This is a related CWE, but CWE-122 more accurately describes the vulnerability.\n*   CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')): This CWE requires a buffer copy operation, and that isn't explicitly mentioned in the description. Also, its usage is \"Allowed-with-Review\".\n*   CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error): There is no indication of an off-by-one error in the description.\n*   CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input): The vulnerability is not explicitly related to improper validation of input quantity.\n*   CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size): There is no mention of incorrect calculation of buffer size.\n\nTherefore, CWE-122 is the most appropriate and specific CWE for this vulnerability, based on the evidence provided.",
