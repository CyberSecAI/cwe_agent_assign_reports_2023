CWE-200 is a *Class* and a ChildOf CWE-668.

The vulnerability description states: \"**Improper access control** vulnerability in sendDHCPACKBroadcast function of SemWifiApClient prior to SMR Jul-2022 Release 1 allows attacker to access wifi ap client mac address that connected by using WIFI_AP_STA_STATE_CHANGED action.\" This is further supported by the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section, which lists \"**Improper access control**\" as the root cause. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms that the root cause is \"**Improper access control vulnerability**\" and the CWE ID listed is **CWE-284**.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-284 as a potential candidate. However, the mapping guidance for CWE-284 discourages its use because it's a high-level *Pillar*. Nevertheless, given the available information and the explicit mention of \"Improper Access Control\", I'm selecting it as the primary CWE.\n\nI also considered **CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor)** as a secondary CWE, since the **impact** is the access to the Wi-Fi AP client MAC address. However, since the root cause is primarily about the access control issue, CWE-284 is more appropriate.\n\nThe selection of CWE-284 is at the optimal level of specificity, given the information provided. While more specific CWEs related to authorization might exist, the high-level nature of the description and the explicit mention of \"Improper Access Control\" make it the most suitable choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
