CWE-307 is a related weakness, addressing the lack of sufficient measures to prevent excessive authentication attempts. Although both could be present, the core issue described in the vulnerability is the discrepancy in response times, making CWE-204 the more direct and suitable classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe204[\"CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe307[\"CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe307 -->|ChildOf| cwe1390\n    cwe307 -->|ChildOf| cwe287\n    cwe1390 -->|ChildOf| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe204 primary\n    class cwe307 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with an **inconsistent rate-limiting** mechanism that leads to an **observable response discrepancy**. This allows for **user enumeration**, which can then be used for further attacks such as social engineering.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **user enumeration vulnerability** as the key weakness. Based on the provided evidence, the root cause is the **inconsistent rate-limiting**, which results in an **observable response discrepancy**. The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** clearly states that \"the system's behavior differs after reaching the brute force limit depending on whether the user exists. For existing users, further login requests are immediately blocked, whereas, for non-existing users, they are not. This difference in response time can be used to determine valid usernames.\"\n\nThe Retriever Results highlighted CWE-204 as the top candidate (score: 0.535), which aligns well with the vulnerability description. The CWE description states: \"The product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\" The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** confirms this by indicating different response times for existing and non-existing users, which allows attackers to enumerate user accounts. The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** specifically mentions the **inconsistent rate-limiting** as a contributing factor, and the remediation was to \"rewrite the affected code so that the delay is also inserted after the brute force limit is reached.\" The relationship graph shows that CWE-204 can follow from missing error pages (CWE-756) but that relationship is not present in this case.\n\nCWE-307 (Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts) was also considered since the vulnerability involves brute-force protection. While relevant, the core issue is not the lack of restriction but the inconsistent application of rate limiting, making CWE-204 the more precise classification.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, providing the most specific representation of the vulnerability's root cause based on the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe

have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control

part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the
