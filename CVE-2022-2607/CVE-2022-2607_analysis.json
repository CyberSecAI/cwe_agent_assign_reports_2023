It can be reached via race conditions (CWE-362, CWE-366) and is related to expired pointer dereferences (CWE-825). This vulnerability resulted in **heap corruption**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe366[\"CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on a Resource after Expiration or Release\"]\n    \n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe362 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe416\n    cwe366 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe416\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe825,cwe362,cwe366,cwe672 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **use after free** which leads to **heap corruption**. The attack vector is triggered via specific UI interactions.\n  - **Root Cause:** Use After Free (CWE-416)\n  - **Weakness:** Heap Corruption\n  - **Trigger:** Specific UI Interactions\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence. The vulnerability is a **use after free** in the Tab Strip component of Google Chrome on Chrome OS. The vulnerability can be triggered by specific UI interactions and can lead to **heap corruption**. The primary CWE is CWE-416 Use After Free, which is a variant level CWE and accurately describes the vulnerability.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states \"**use after free** in Tab Strip\" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this root cause: \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-after-free\". The \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section also lists CWE-416 as the primary CWE match.\n\nOther CWEs such as CWE-366 Race Condition within a Thread, CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') are not selected because there is no evidence of race conditions.\n\nCWE-416 is the optimal level of specificity as it is a variant level CWE that accurately describes the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-356: Product UI does not Warn User of Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product's user interface does not warn the user before undertaking an unsafe action on behalf of that user.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
