CWE-1393 is a more specific case of CWE-1392, focusing specifically on default passwords, while CWE-1392 covers a broader range of default credentials.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1393[\"CWE-1393: Use of Default Password\"]\n    cwe1392[\"CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe1393 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1392\n    cwe1392 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1393 primary\n    class cwe1392,cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with the **default password being persisted** after installation, leading to the ability to **escalate privileges**. The root cause is the **use of default credentials**, and the impact is privilege escalation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the root cause as the **persistence of a default password** after installation, allowing for potential privilege escalation. The retriever results also highlighted CWE-1393 (Use of Default Password) and CWE-1392 (Use of Default Credentials) as top candidates.\n\nThe vulnerability description states \"A **default password is persisted** after installation and may be discovered and used to escalate privileges.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating: \"Root cause: A default password is persisted after installation.\" and \"Weaknesses: Use of default credentials\".\n\nBased on this evidence, CWE-1393 (Use of Default Password) is the most appropriate mapping. It is a Base level CWE, providing sufficient specificity. The MITRE mapping guidance allows its use, and the description aligns directly with the vulnerability.\n\nOther CWEs considered:\n\n*   CWE-1392 (Use of Default Credentials): While related as a parent, CWE-1393 is more specific, focusing solely on passwords.\n*   CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials): This is a more general case. Since the vulnerability specifically mentions a \"default password\" rather than a hard-coded credential, CWE-1393 is a better fit.\n*   CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password): This is similar to CWE-798, but more specific to passwords. However, \"default password\" is more accurate than \"hard-coded password\" based on the description.\n*   CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions) - Although it was one of the top hits, this is not related to the described vulnerability.\n*   CWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges) - Although it was one of the top hits, this is not related to the described vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1393 is based on the evidence provided and represents the most specific and accurate classification of the vulnerability's root cause.",
