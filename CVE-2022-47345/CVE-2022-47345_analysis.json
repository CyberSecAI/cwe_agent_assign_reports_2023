CWE-862 and CWE-280 are more specific than CWE-285. The relationship between CWE-862 and CWE-280 is less direct, but both relate to authorization issues. CWE-862 is the **missing** check, while CWE-280 captures the handling of **insufficient** permissions.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe280[\"CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe280 -->|CHILDOF| cwe755\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe280 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing permission check** (CWE-862)\n2.  **Impact:** Local denial of service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a **missing permission check** in engineermode services, leading to a local denial of service.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). This aligns directly with the root cause: the system does not perform an authorization check before allowing access to certain functionality. The description of CWE-862 states: \"The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\" This directly matches the provided vulnerability description.\n\nCWE-280 (Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges) is considered as a secondary CWE. While the description mentions a **missing permission check**, it implicitly involves the handling of insufficient permissions. If the permission check was present but the handling of insufficient permissions was incorrect, CWE-280 would have been more appropriate. However, due to the **missing** check, CWE-862 takes precedence.\n\nCWE-129 (Improper Validation of Array Index) was the primary CWE match for similar CVE Descriptions, but is not applicable here because the vulnerability does not involve array indexing.\n\nThe evidence for CWE-862 is the phrase \"**missing permission check**\".\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community.
