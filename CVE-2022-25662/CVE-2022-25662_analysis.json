This CWE has parent relationships to CWE-119 **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**. The vulnerability description directly states the **rootcause** is **untrusted pointer dereference**, making CWE-822 the most appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe822[\"CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe822 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe822 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  The **rootcause** is an **untrusted pointer dereference** (CWE-822).\n2.  The impact is information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identifies the **rootcause** as **untrusted pointer dereference**, which directly maps to CWE-822. The vulnerability description key phrases clearly state this. The \"Retriever Results\" also lists CWE-822 as the top combined result.\n\nThe evidence from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" is:\n- **rootcause:** **untrusted pointer dereference**\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, and the graph relationships confirm that CWE-822 is the most specific and appropriate choice. The selection of CWE-822 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product obtains a value from an untrusted source, converts this value to a pointer, and dereferences the resulting pointer.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAn attacker can supply a pointer for memory locations that the product is not expecting. If the pointer is dereferenced for a write operation, the attack might allow modification of critical state variables, cause a crash, or execute code. If the dereferencing operation is for a read, then the attack might allow reading of sensitive data, cause a crash, or set a variable to an unexpected value (since the value will be read from an unexpected memory location).\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset\nCWE-823 was considered as a possible option. However, the vulnerability description does not explicitly mention pointer arithmetic or offsets. It only states **untrusted pointer dereference**. Therefore, CWE-823 is not selected.\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\nCWE-126 was considered as a possible option. However, the vulnerability description does not explicitly mention reading past the end of the buffer, instead only that there is an **untrusted pointer dereference**. Therefore, CWE-126 is not selected.\n\n## CWE-1314: Missing Write Protection for Parametric Data Values\nCWE-1314 was considered as a possible option. However, the vulnerability description does not explicitly mention parametric data values, instead only that there is an **untrusted pointer dereference**. Therefore, CWE-1314 is not selected.\n\n## CWE-415: Double Free\nCWE-415 was considered as a possible option. However, the vulnerability description does not explicitly mention any double free condition, instead only that there is an **untrusted pointer dereference**. Therefore, CWE-415 is not selected.",
