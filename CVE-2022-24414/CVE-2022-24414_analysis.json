CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) is also related to CWE-201 as they both involve the exposure of sensitive information. The vulnerability involves using GET requests, which can lead to sensitive information being logged.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe598[\"CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    \n    cwe598 -->|CHILDOF| cwe201\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe201\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe598 primary\n    class cwe532,cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Auth Token being exposed in GET requests**. This leads to the **impact** of potential unauthorized access to the CloudLink server if the tokens are logged and subsequently accessed by attackers.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the root cause and impact described in the vulnerability description. The key phrase \"**Auth Token is exposed in GET requests**\" directly indicates the core weakness. The retriever results and complete CWE specifications were then used to identify the most appropriate CWE.\n\nThe primary selection, CWE-598, is based on the explicit use of GET requests with sensitive query strings. The evidence for this is found in the vulnerability description: \"Dell EMC CloudLink 7.1.3 and all earlier versions, **Auth Token is exposed in GET requests**.\"\n\nCWE-532 is considered a secondary candidate because the vulnerability description indicates that the tokens can be logged in reverse proxies and server logs. \"These request parameters can get logged in reverse proxies and server logs.\"\n\nCWE-201 is also a secondary candidate as the **Auth Token is exposed in GET requests** and is sensitive information that should not be accessible.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by showing how CWE-598 is a variant of CWE-201.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-598 is a Variant that accurately captures the specific use of GET requests with sensitive query strings.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
