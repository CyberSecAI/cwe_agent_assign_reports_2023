This hierarchical relationship indicates that CWE-548 is a more specific type of information exposure. CWE-552 (Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties) is a broader base CWE. Choosing CWE-548 provides a more precise characterization of the **directory listing** vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe548[\"CWE-548: Exposure of Information Through Directory Listing\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe552[\"CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\"]\n    \n    cwe548 -->|CHILDOF| cwe497\n    cwe552 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe548 primary\n    class cwe552 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Directory Listing** enabled on the server for the uploaded resumes directory.\n2.  **Weakness:** Public accessibility of uploaded resumes.\n3.  **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive personal information contained in the resumes.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-548 (Exposure of Information Through Directory Listing). This is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions a **\"Directory Listing\"**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the plugin allows public access to the directory where uploaded resumes are stored. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-548, which states that \"A directory listing is inappropriately exposed, yielding potentially sensitive information to attackers.\"\n\nCWE-552 (Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties) was considered as a secondary candidate, as the **directory listing** makes the files within that directory accessible to external parties.\n\nThe choice of CWE-548 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **directory listing** issue, whereas CWE-552 is a broader category. The evidence strongly supports this classification, with a confidence score of 0.9.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-548: Exposure of Information Through Directory Listing\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA directory listing is inappropriately exposed, yielding potentially sensitive information to attackers.\n\n### Extended Description\nA directory listing provides an attacker with the complete index of all the resources located inside of the directory.

Applications may store sensitive files underneath this root without also using access control to limit which users may request those files, if any. Alternately, an application might package multiple files or directories into an archive file (e.g., ZIP or tar), but the application might not exclude sensitive files that are underneath those directories.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-668\nChildOf -> CWE-285\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
