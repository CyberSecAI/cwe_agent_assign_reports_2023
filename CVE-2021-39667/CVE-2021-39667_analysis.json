CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). The vulnerability description clearly indicates a heap buffer overflow due to an out-of-bounds write, making CWE-122 the most specific and appropriate choice. The hierarchical relationship supports this selection as CWE-122 is a more specific type of CWE-787.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe122 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively straightforward:\n1.  A **heap buffer overflow** (CWE-122) occurs due to an **out-of-bounds write**.\n2.  This leads to a potential remote information disclosure.\nThe root cause is the heap buffer overflow, and the impact is information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified a heap buffer overflow (**weakness**) vulnerability, leading to remote information disclosure (**impact**). The evidence from the vulnerability description states, \"In ih264d_parse_decode_slice of ih264d_parse_slice.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a **heap buffer overflow**. This could lead to remote information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section supports this by describing \"Incorrect slice increments during header parsing in libavc.\" as a root cause.\n\nThe Retriever Results listed CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) as the top combined result, but this is a class-level CWE and the mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available. CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is a variant and a much more precise fit for the vulnerability description, making it the primary choice. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is also considered, as this is the mechanism of the heap buffer overflow, but CWE-122 is a better fit since it specifies where the out-of-bounds write occurs.\n\nThe selection of CWE-122 is based on the explicit mention of a \"heap buffer overflow\" in the vulnerability description. This direct evidence, combined with the hierarchical relationship analysis, confirms that CWE-122 is the most accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.

When this occurs, the value may\n         become a very small or negative number.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that generates incorrect or unintended results that are later used in security-critical decisions or resource management.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.
