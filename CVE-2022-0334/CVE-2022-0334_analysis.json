This choice is supported by the direct evidence of **insufficient capability checks** in the vulnerability description. The secondary CWE, CWE-863 **[CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization]**, represents a scenario where authorization checks are present but flawed. CWE-639 **[CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key]** is a base CWE and child of CWE-863 **[CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization]**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient capability checks** (CWE-862 **[CWE-862: Missing Authorization]**), leading to unauthorized access to grade reports.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the key phrase **\"insufficient capability checks\"** strongly pointed towards an authorization issue. Further analysis of the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirmed that the `gradereport/user:view` capability was not consistently enforced. This led to the selection of CWE-862 **[CWE-862: Missing Authorization]** as the primary CWE, indicating a **lack of proper access controls**.\n\nThe alternative CWEs were considered based on the Retriever Results and the Complete CWE Specifications. CWE-863 **[CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization]** was considered as a secondary candidate because while the primary issue is the *lack* of checks, there might be flawed checks in place. CWE-639 **[CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key]** was also considered as a secondary candidate because the vulnerability involves a user accessing data they shouldn't have access to, potentially by manipulating keys or identifiers, though there is no direct evidence for this.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-862 **[CWE-862: Missing Authorization]** as the primary CWE is based on the direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the supporting CVE Reference Links Content Summary.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
