CWE-862 is a Class-level CWE, and while it has potential Base-level children, none are a direct fit based on the provided information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe279[\"CWE-279: Incorrect Execution-Assigned Permissions\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|ChildOf| cwe284\n    cwe279 -->|ChildOf| cwe732\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe279 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward: a **missing permission check** (CWE-862) leads to the ability to set up power management service without proper authorization.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-862 Missing Authorization\n  - **Impact:** Setting up power management service without required privileges.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points towards CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description clearly states a **missing permission check** in the power management service, which directly aligns with the definition of CWE-862: \"The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\" The Unisoc webpage provides no information. The **CWE for similar CVE Descriptions** also lists CWE-862 as the primary match. The Retriever Results list CWE-862 as the top combined result.\n\nCWE-279 \"Incorrect Execution-Assigned Permissions\" was considered as a secondary candidate, as it deals with permission assignments during execution. However, the description focuses on a **missing check**, not an incorrect assignment. Therefore, CWE-862 is more appropriate.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately represents the core issue: the absence of an authorization check. While more specific variants might exist, the available evidence does not support a more granular classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
