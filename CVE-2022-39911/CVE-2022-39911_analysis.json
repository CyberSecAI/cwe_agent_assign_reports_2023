The retriever results also lists this CWE with a high score. The description of CWE-754 states: \"The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\" This aligns well with the vulnerability description.\n\nCWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions) is a Pillar-level CWE. While the vulnerability description includes the exact phrase for this CWE, it is too general. CWE-754 is a child of CWE-703 and provides a more specific classification. The mapping guidance for CWE-703 discourages its use because it is \"extremely high-level, a Pillar.\"\n\nI am selecting CWE-754 at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the **rootcause** described in the vulnerability description. The \"Improper check or handling of exceptional conditions\" is a coding error that leads to the security vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.",
