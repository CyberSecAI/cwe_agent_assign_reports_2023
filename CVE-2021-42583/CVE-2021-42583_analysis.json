CWE-328 is a child of CWE-326 and CWE-327, Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm, which is a Class level CWE. CWE-1240, Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation, is also related as it is a child of CWE-327. The choice of CWE-328 is based on the specific weakness of using a weak hash algorithm, making it more specific than its parent classes.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe1240[\"CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    \n    cwe328 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    cwe1240 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    cwe327 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe328 primary\n    class cwe327,cwe1240 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm** (MD5 in this case) which leads to the **use of a weak hash**. This, in turn, leads to the potential exposure of sensitive information (passwords).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the **rootcause** as a **Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm**. The retriever results also pointed to CWE-327, CWE-328 and CWE-1240 as potential candidates.\n\nThe evidence from the CVE reference links clearly indicates that the vulnerability stems from the **use of MD5-based password hashes**. The description notes that MD5 is considered cryptographically broken and vulnerable to collision attacks, making password recovery easier for attackers. This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-328, \"Use of Weak Hash,\" which specifies the use of an algorithm that does not meet security expectations for a hash function.\n\nWhile CWE-327, \"Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm,\" is also relevant, CWE-328 is a more specific and accurate representation of the weakness. CWE-1240, \"Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation,\" is also a valid candidate, but CWE-328 is more precise in this context, since MD5's weakness as a hash function is well-documented.\n\nTherefore, CWE-328 is selected as the primary CWE because it is the most specific and accurately reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The evidence supports this decision, and the relationship analysis confirms that it is the appropriate level of abstraction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 8160.69\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 9214.46\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
