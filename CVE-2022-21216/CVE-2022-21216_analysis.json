Matches the root cause of the vulnerability. |\n| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 0.6 | Pillar | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. A more general category that is less specific than CWE-1220. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-1220, which is a Base level CWE. It has a ChildOf relationship to CWE-284, which is a Pillar level CWE. Since the vulnerability description clearly indicates **insufficient granularity of access control** as the root cause, CWE-1220 is the most appropriate choice. Choosing the more specific Base level CWE is preferred.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1220[\"CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe1220 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1220 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient granularity of access control**, which then leads to a privileged user being able to escalate their privileges.\n\nRoot Cause: **Insufficient granularity of access control** (CWE-1220)\nImpact: Escalation of Privilege\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the root cause is the **insufficient granularity of access control** in the out-of-band management of some Intel processors. This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-1220. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by explicitly stating \"Insufficient granularity of access control in out-of-band management of certain Intel processors.\"\nThe retriever results also list CWE-1220 as the top candidate with a good similarity score.\nCWE-284 was considered but it is a more general, Pillar level CWE. The MITRE mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-284 when more specific CWEs are available. Therefore, CWE-1220 is the most appropriate and specific CWE to map to this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
