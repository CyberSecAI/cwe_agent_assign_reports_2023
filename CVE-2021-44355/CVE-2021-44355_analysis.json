CWE-20 is a class-level CWE representing improper input validation in general, while CWE-1287 is a base-level CWE that represents improper validation of a specific *type* of input. Given the evidence, the program **does not validate the type of the \u2018param\u2019 field in JSON requests and assumes it is always an object**, a more specific CWE-1287 is considered.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe1287[\"CWE-1287: Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input\"]\n\n    cwe1287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe1287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)**, specifically **Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input (CWE-1287)**, which leads to a **denial of service** due to the application crashing and rebooting.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, CWE-20 was selected because the application does not validate the type of the 'param' field in JSON requests. However, the provided information states that the `cgiserver.cgi` program **incorrectly assumes that the `param` field of a JSON request is always a JSON object**. This implies that the program fails to validate that the input is of the *specified type*. Therefore, CWE-1287 is considered as a secondary candidate to represent the root cause of the vulnerability, specifically the **Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input**.\n\nThe evidence to support this is:\n*   \"The `cgiserver.cgi` program incorrectly assumes that the `param` field of a JSON request is always a JSON object\"\n*   \"Improper Input Validation (CWE-20): The cgiserver.cgi application does not validate the type of the 'param' field in JSON requests and assumes it is always an object.\"\n\nWhile CWE-20 is a high level, general weakness, the detailed cause is due to the application not validating the input type which is covered by CWE-1287. CWE-20 is the primary based on similar CVE descriptions while CWE-1287 is a secondary candidate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis CWE is not selected because the vulnerability is specifically related to input type validation, not equivalence.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis CWE is not selected as the core issue is the lack of validation, not that a protection mechanism relies on the input.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\nThis CWE is not selected because the vulnerability does not involve injection.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis CWE is not selected because the vulnerability is not related to an incomplete list of disallowed inputs.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
