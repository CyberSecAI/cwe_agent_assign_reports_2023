This is a base-level CWE. Secondary CWEs considered are CWE-184 and CWE-646. CWE-184 relates to an incomplete list of disallowed inputs, while CWE-646 focuses on reliance on filename or extension. These CWEs offer additional nuance to the primary weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    cwe184[\"CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\"]\n    cwe646[\"CWE-646: Reliance on File Name or Extension of Externally-Supplied File\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Type\"]\n    cwe669[\"CWE-669: Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres\"]\n\n    cwe434 -->|CHILDOF| cwe669\n    cwe646 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe434 primary\n    class cwe184,cwe646 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **unrestricted upload of a file with a dangerous type** (CWE-434). This occurs due to a **weakness** in the whitelist implementation, potentially due to an **incomplete list of disallowed inputs** (CWE-184) and/or **reliance on file name or extension** (CWE-646) which allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files. This could lead to remote code execution or other impacts.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis concludes that the primary CWE for this vulnerability is CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type). This decision is based on the vulnerability description which explicitly states \"Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\". The evidence strength is high due to the explicit nature of the description. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause lies in a flawed whitelist implementation, making CWE-434 the most appropriate primary classification.\n\nSupporting evidence from the vulnerability description:\n\n*   \"**weakness: unrestricted upload of file with dangerous type**\"\n*   \"The core issue arises from an improper implementation or oversight in the whitelist, potentially allowing for the upload of unexpected or malicious file types.\"\n*   \"A successful attack could allow an attacker to upload arbitrary files, including executable files, scripts, or other malicious content.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the consideration of CWE-184 and CWE-646 as secondary CWEs, as they provide additional context to the root cause. CWE-434 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly describes the core vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
