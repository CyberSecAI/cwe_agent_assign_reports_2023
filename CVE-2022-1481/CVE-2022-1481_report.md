# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2022-1481

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary identified CWE is CWE-416, which is a Variant level weakness. This is appropriate as it is a specific type of memory corruption issue. CWE-416 is a child of CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference) and CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiration). The vulnerability description explicitly mentions "use after free," making CWE-416 the most accurate and specific classification.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **use after free** condition (CWE-416) in the Sharing component of Google Chrome, triggered by a crafted HTML page, which leads to potential heap corruption.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly states a "**use after free**" in the Sharing component, leading to potential heap corruption. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this with the statement: "Root cause of vulnerability: Use after free in Sharing component" and "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Use after free".

The primary CWE match from similar CVE descriptions is CWE-416, and the top CWE listed is also CWE-416. Retriever results also list CWE-416 as the top combined result.

Given the explicit mention of "**use after free**" and the alignment with existing mappings and retriever results, CWE-416 is the most appropriate and specific classification. The use of a Variant level CWE is suitable as it directly reflects the nature of the vulnerability.

Other CWEs Considered and Rejected:

*   CWE-366 (Race Condition within a Thread): While concurrency issues can sometimes lead to use-after-free vulnerabilities, there is no direct evidence of a race condition in the provided description. Therefore, this CWE is not selected.
*   CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow): The vulnerability results in heap corruption, but the root cause is the use-after-free, not a buffer overflow directly.
*   CWE-843 (Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')): There is no explicit mention of type confusion in the vulnerability description.
*   CWE-451 (User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information): This is not relevant as the vulnerability is not related to UI misrepresentation.
*   CWE-415 (Double Free): The vulnerability description specifically mentions use-after-free and not a double free.
*   CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write): Although heap corruption is an impact, the root cause is use-after-free.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.81
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
If two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.



## CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, i.e., after the resource is no longer needed.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-665: Improper Initialization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not initialize a critical resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-826: Premature Release of Resource During Expected Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource that is still intended to be used by itself or another actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 5814.02
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. This is often a component in phishing attacks.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children
