## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper ID generation algorithm** in NetBSD, leading to predictable IPv4 IDs, weak TCP ISN, and weak IPv6 flow label generation. The use of a cryptographically weak PRNG allows for data exfiltration and information leakage.

## Summary of Analysis
Initially, the **improper ID generation algorithm** seemed to fit CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values). However, the detail that the algorithm was cryptographically weak suggests a more specific classification. The CVE reference links content summary confirms that the root cause lies in predictable IPv4 ID generation and weak TCP ISN/IPv6 flow label generation. The retriever results also identify CWE-338 (Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)) as a strong candidate.

The evidence supports the selection of CWE-338 because the **rootcause** is the use of a cryptographically weak PRNG for ID generation, which is more specific than simply using insufficiently random values (CWE-330). CWE-338 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred.

The final decision is based on the following evidence:

*   "**rootcause:** **improper ID generation algorithm**"
*   CVE Reference Links Content Summary: "The root cause of the vulnerability is the predictable nature of the IPv4 ID generation in NetBSD, where it was a simple counter instead of a randomly generated value."
*   CVE Reference Links Content Summary: "Weak TCP Initial Sequence Number Generation"
*   CVE Reference Links Content Summary: "Weak IPv6 Flow Label Generation"

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be primary to many other weaknesses such as cryptographic errors, authentication errors, symlink following, information leaks, and others.

**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.3, CWE-330 and its descendants are being investigated by the CWE crypto team to identify gaps related to randomness and unpredictability, as well as the relationships between randomness and cryptographic primitives. This "subtree analysis" might result in the addition or deprecation of existing entries; the reorganization of relationships in some views, e.g. the research view (CWE-1000); more consistent use of terminology; and/or significant modifications to related entries.

**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, "randomness" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-3692:** PHP framework uses mt_rand() function (Marsenne Twister) when generating tokens
- **CVE-2020-7010:** Cloud application on Kubernetes generates passwords using a weak random number generator based on deployment time.
- **CVE-2009-3278:** Crypto product uses rand() library function to generate a recovery key, making it easier to conduct brute force attacks.




## CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) in a security context, but the PRNG's algorithm is not cryptographically strong.

### Extended Description


When a non-cryptographic PRNG is used in a cryptographic context, it can expose the cryptography to certain types of attacks.


Often a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is not designed for cryptography. Sometimes a mediocre source of randomness is sufficient or preferable for algorithms that use random numbers. Weak generators generally take less processing power and/or do not use the precious, finite, entropy sources on a system. While such PRNGs might have very useful features, these same features could be used to break the cryptography.

## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.

### Extended Description


Cryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.


It is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.


Since the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered "unsafe" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.


For a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30273:** SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity
- **CVE-2022-30320:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.
- **CVE-2008-3775:** Product uses "ROT-25" to obfuscate the password in the registry.




## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).

### Extended Description


A hash function is defined as an algorithm that maps arbitrarily sized data into a fixed-sized digest (output) such that the following properties hold:


  1. The algorithm is not invertible (also called "one-way" or "not reversible")

  1. The algorithm is deterministic; the same input produces the same digest every time

 Building on this definition, a cryptographic hash function must also ensure that a malicious actor cannot leverage the hash function to have a reasonable chance of success at determining any of the following:

  1. the original input (preimage attack), given only the digest

  1. another input that can produce the same digest (2nd preimage attack), given the original input

  1. a set of two or more inputs that evaluate to the same digest (birthday attack), given the actor can arbitrarily choose the inputs to be hashed and can do so a reasonable amount of times

What is regarded as "reasonable" varies by context and threat model, but in general, "reasonable" could cover any attack that is more efficient than brute force (i.e., on average, attempting half of all possible combinations). Note that some attacks might be more efficient than brute force but are still not regarded as achievable in the real world.

Any algorithm that does not meet the above conditions will generally be considered weak for general use in hashing.


In addition to algorithmic weaknesses, a hash function can be made weak by using the hash in a security context that breaks its security guarantees. For example, using a hash function without a salt for storing passwords (that are sufficiently short) could enable an adversary to create a "rainbow table" [REF-637] to recover the password under certain conditions; this attack works against such hash functions as MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2.

- **CVE-2020-25685:** DNS product uses a weak hash (CRC32 or SHA-1) of the query name, allowing attacker to forge responses by computing domain names with the same hash.




## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

### Extended Description


By design, authentication protocols try to ensure that attackers must perform brute force attacks if they do not know the credentials such as a key or password. However, when these credentials are easily predictable or even fixed (as with default or hard-coded passwords and keys), then the attacker can defeat the mechanism without relying on brute force.


Credentials may be weak for different reasons, such as:


  - Hard-coded (i.e., static and unchangeable by the administrator)

  - Default (i.e., the same static value across different deployments/installations, but able to be changed by the administrator)

  - Predictable (i.e., generated in a way that produces unique credentials across deployments/installations, but can still be guessed with reasonable efficiency)

Even if a new, unique credential is intended to be generated for each product installation, if the generation is predictable, then that may also simplify guessing attacks.

- **CVE-2022-30270:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses default credentials for some SSH accounts
- **CVE-2022-29965:** Distributed Control System (DCS) uses a deterministic algorithm to generate utility passwords




## CWE-335: Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) but does not correctly manage seeds.

### Extended Description


 PRNGs are deterministic and, while their output appears random, they cannot actually create entropy. They rely on cryptographically secure and unique seeds for entropy so proper seeding is critical to the secure operation of the PRNG.


 Management of seeds could be broken down into two main areas: 


  -  (1) protecting seeds as cryptographic material (such as a cryptographic key); 

  -  (2) whenever possible, using a uniquely generated seed from a cryptographically secure source 

 PRNGs require a seed as input to generate a stream of numbers that are functionally indistinguishable from random numbers. While the output is, in many cases, sufficient for cryptographic uses, the output of any PRNG is directly determined by the seed provided as input. If the seed can be ascertained by a third party, the entire output of the PRNG can be made known to them. As such, the seed should be kept secret and should ideally not be able to be guessed. For example, the current time may be a poor seed. Knowing the approximate time the PRNG was seeded greatly reduces the possible key space. 

 Seeds do not necessarily need to be unique, but reusing seeds may open up attacks if the seed is discovered.

## CWE-804: Guessable CAPTCHA
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a CAPTCHA challenge, but the challenge can be guessed or automatically recognized by a non-human actor.

### Extended Description


An automated attacker could bypass the intended protection of the CAPTCHA challenge and perform actions at a higher frequency than humanly possible, such as launching spam attacks.


There can be several different causes of a guessable CAPTCHA:


  - An audio or visual image that does not have sufficient distortion from the unobfuscated source image.

  - A question is generated with a format that can be automatically recognized, such as a math question.

  - A question for which the number of possible answers is limited, such as birth years or favorite sports teams.

  - A general-knowledge or trivia question for which the answer can be accessed using a data base, such as country capitals or popular entertainers.

**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, "randomness" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29330:** Product for administering PBX systems uses predictable identifiers and timestamps for filenames (CWE-340) which allows attackers to access files via direct request (CWE-425).
- **CVE-2001-1141:** PRNG allows attackers to use the output of small PRNG requests to determine the internal state information, which could be used by attackers to predict future pseudo-random numbers.
- **CVE-1999-0074:** Listening TCP ports are sequentially allocated, allowing spoofing attacks.




## CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-345
ChildOf -> CWE-345

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-1796:** Does not properly verify signatures for "trusted" entities.
- **CVE-2005-2181:** Insufficient verification allows spoofing.
- **CVE-2005-2182:** Insufficient verification allows spoofing.




## CWE-341: Predictable from Observable State
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A number or object is predictable based on observations that the attacker can make about the state of the system or network, such as time, process ID, etc.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-340

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-0389:** Mail server stores private mail messages with predictable filenames in a world-executable directory, which allows local users to read private mailing list archives.
- **CVE-2001-1141:** PRNG allows attackers to use the output of small PRNG requests to determine the internal state information, which could be used by attackers to predict future pseudo-random numbers.
- **CVE-2000-0335:** DNS resolver library uses predictable IDs, which allows a local attacker to spoof DNS query results.
