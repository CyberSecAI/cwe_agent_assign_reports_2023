The secondary CWE considered is CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), which is a class-level CWE and a child of CWE-285 and CWE-284.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe74,cwe285,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Incorrect Access Control**, leading to **cross-site scripting** due to lack of proper encoding, and culminates in information disclosure through local file read.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, which allows an authenticated administrator to read local files by exploiting XSS into a PDF generator when exporting data as a PDF.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description includes:\n\n*   \"Zkteco BioTime < 8.5.3 Build20200816.447 is vulnerable to **Incorrect Access Control** via resign, private message, manual log, time interval, attshift, and holiday.\"\n*   \"An authenticated administrator can read local files by exploiting XSS into a pdf generator when exporting data as a PDF\"\n*   \"The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of proper encoding on parameters vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).\"\n\nBased on this, CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) is the most appropriate primary CWE.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is considered as a secondary candidate because the vulnerability description mentions \"**Incorrect Access Control**\".\n\nThe final selection is based on the evidence provided and the descriptions of the candidate CWEs. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, capturing the root cause and related weaknesses.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
