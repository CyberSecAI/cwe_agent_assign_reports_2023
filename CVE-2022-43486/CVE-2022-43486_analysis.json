The key evidence is the presence of **hidden functionality** that enables arbitrary command execution.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-912 (Hidden Functionality), which aligns with the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions **Hidden Functionality (CWE-912)** as a weakness. The description of CWE-912 states: \"The product contains functionality that is not documented, not part of the specification, and not accessible through an interface or command sequence that is obvious to the product's users or administrators.\" This aligns with the vulnerability description.\n\nThe secondary CWE is CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')), because the impact of enabling the **hidden functionality** is arbitrary command execution. The vulnerability description states the attacker can \"execute an arbitrary command on the affected devices\".\n\nCWE-284 (Improper Access Control) was considered because the **hidden functionality** effectively bypasses normal access controls, but it's too high-level. CWE-912 is more specific. The retriever results also list CWE-284, but the mapping guidance discourages its use.\n\nCWE-78 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the impact of the vulnerability: arbitrary command execution. CWE-912 is at the class level, but it is more descriptive of the root cause than any of its base-level children.",
