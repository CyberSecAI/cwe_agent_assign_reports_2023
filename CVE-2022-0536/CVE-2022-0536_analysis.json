This exposure can then lead to account takeover or data breach.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **improper removal of sensitive information**. The vulnerability description key phrases clearly indicate this. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further clarifies that the `follow-redirects` library fails to remove sensitive headers, leading to potential exposure.\n\nThe Retriever Results listed CWE-212 as a top candidate, and its description aligns well with the vulnerability. The final decision was to map the vulnerability to CWE-212 as the primary CWE and CWE-201 as the secondary CWE.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision is:\n\n*   \"**Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer** in NPM follow-redirects prior to 1.14.8\" - This directly matches the definition of CWE-212.\n*   \"The vulnerability stems from the `follow-redirects` library not correctly dropping confidential headers when redirecting to a different scheme (e.g., from HTTPS to HTTP) or a different domain (not a subdomain)\" - This explains the technical details behind the **improper removal**.\n*   \"The core issue is the failure to remove sensitive headers like `Authorization` and `Cookie` when a redirect leads to a different scheme or domain. This can expose sensitive data to unintended recipients.\" - This shows how the **improper removal** leads to sensitive data being sent.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the weakness without being overly broad or narrow. CWE-212 directly addresses the core issue of **improper removal**, while CWE-201 captures the consequence of that failure of the data being sent.\n\n**CWEs Considered But Not Used:**\n\n*   CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') - While present in the Retriever Results, this CWE is not applicable as the vulnerability does not involve buffer copies or overflows.\n*   CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information - This CWE relates to storage, while the described vulnerability relates to the transmission of sensitive information.\n*   CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information - Similar to CWE-312, this CWE focuses on storage-related issues, not the transmission of sensitive information.\n*   CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File - The vulnerability doesn't relate to log files.",
