This indicates a specialization of code injection where the injected code is statically saved. The secondary CWE is CWE-425, and it can precede CWE-98 which is a variant of code injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe96[\"CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n\n    cwe96 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe425 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe96\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe96 primary\n    class cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insecure implementation of PHP code execution** functionality, which allows **any user able to edit posts** to execute PHP code snippets. This leads to potential **Remote Code Execution**, and ultimately a complete site takeover. The ability for low-privileged users to access the PHP code execution functionality can be viewed as a **missing access control** issue.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **rootcause** of **PHP code execution** through the WordPress plugin. The evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the plugin allowed execution of PHP code via a metabox, accessible by users with the `edit_posts` capability. This aligns well with CWE-96 because the **PHP Code Snippets via WordPress metaboxes** is equivalent to **directives in statically saved code**. The retriever results also listed CWE-96 at the top.\n\nCWE-425 was also considered, as the vulnerability allows low-privileged users to execute arbitrary PHP code. This is because the code can be executed via the metabox that is available to all users with the `edit_posts` capability.\n\nThe final decision was to select CWE-96 as the primary weakness due to the direct match with the vulnerability description. CWE-425 is a secondary weakness in this case. These selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, providing a clear and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
