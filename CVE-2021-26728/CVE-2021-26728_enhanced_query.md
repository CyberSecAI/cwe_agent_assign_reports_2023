Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') (Score: 310.13)

The product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow....

### 2. CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 293.77)

A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function)....

### 3. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 291.03)

### 5. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 286.72)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...
