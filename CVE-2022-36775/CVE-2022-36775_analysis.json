The vulnerability description mentions **HTTP header injection** due to **improper input validation** of HOST headers, making CWE-113 the most specific and relevant choice. While CWE-20 is also applicable due to the root cause being **improper input validation**, it's a class-level CWE and less specific than CWE-113. The relationships confirm that CWE-113 stems from input validation issues and contributes to the broader category of injection vulnerabilities.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences (CRLF Injection)\"]\n\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe93\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe113 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20) of the HOST headers, leading to **HTTP header injection** (CWE-113). This injection can then result in cross-site scripting, cache poisoning, or session hijacking.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis, based on the vulnerability description and key phrases, strongly suggests CWE-113 due to the explicit mention of **HTTP header injection**. The **root cause** is **improper input validation**, which is a broader category represented by CWE-20. The \"Retriever Results\" also list CWE-113 as a candidate, further supporting this choice.\n\nThe vulnerability description states that \"IBM Security Verify Access... is vulnerable to **HTTP header injection**, caused by **improper validation of input** by the HOST headers. This could allow an attacker to conduct various attacks against the vulnerable system, including cross-site scripting, cache poisoning or session hijacking.\" This statement directly supports the selection of CWE-113 because it clearly indicates **HTTP header injection**.\n\nCWE-113 is chosen because it specifically addresses the vulnerability of **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers**, which aligns perfectly with the **HTTP header injection** described in the vulnerability. While CWE-20 is a valid consideration due to the **improper input validation**, CWE-113 provides a more precise and specific classification. The \"Retriever Results\" confirms that CWE-113 is an appropriate selection with a good score.\n\nThe selection of CWE-113 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **HTTP header injection** issue, which is more specific than the general **improper input validation** (CWE-20). This is a variant level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
