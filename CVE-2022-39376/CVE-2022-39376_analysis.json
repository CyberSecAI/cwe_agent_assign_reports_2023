While XSS (CWE-79) could be a symptom of template injection, the root cause here is the improper handling of template engine elements.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n\n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe1336 -->|PEEROF| cwe79\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1336 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n    class cwe94 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper input validation** on email links, which allows users to **inject custom field values** into `mailto` links. This leads to the ability to inject special elements into a template engine, resulting in potential Cross-site Scripting if the output is not properly neutralized.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability description points towards a general injection issue. However, the description explicitly mentions the injection of custom field values into `mailto` links and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" mentions improper input sanitization. Given the context of injecting values into `mailto` links, CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) is the most relevant primary CWE.\n\nThe vulnerability description states that users may be able to **inject custom fields** values in `mailto` links.\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this by stating:\n- **Root cause of vulnerability**: **Improper input validation** on email links allows users to **inject custom field values** into `mailto` links.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization, allowing for the injection of arbitrary data into mailto links.\n\nCWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) is considered as a secondary CWE because the injected content, if not properly neutralized, might lead to XSS. However, the primary issue is the template injection itself.\n\nCWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) was considered but rejected because it is a high-level class, and CWE-1336 provides a more specific description of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) was not explicitly chosen, although the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" mentions it. The evidence better supports CWE-1336, as the vulnerability involves injecting into a template engine rather than a generic input validation issue.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they directly address the root cause and potential impact of the vulnerability based on the provided evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
