While CWE-330 is a parent of CWE-331, it is a Class, and the more specific Base CWE is more appropriate. Other CWEs like CWE-668, CWE-327, CWE-321, etc. were considered but deemed less relevant as they address different aspects of security vulnerabilities.\n\nTherefore, the final decision is to classify this vulnerability as CWE-331 (Insufficient Entropy) with a confidence score of 1.
