Its children, such as CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) and CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function), offer more specific classifications. CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) is a base-level weakness that can result from authentication flaws. The relationship between CWE-287 and its children, as well as its potential to lead to CWE-201, influenced the decision to include both CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n\n    cwe1390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe201 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe1390,cwe306,cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper authentication** (CWE-287). This leads to the exposure of the email address (CWE-201).\n  - **Root Cause:** **Improper Authentication** (CWE-287)\n  - **Weakness:** Insufficient validation of the user's identity\n  - **Impact:** Information Disclosure - Obtain email address of the blog poster (CWE-201)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **improper authentication** as the primary issue. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section clearly indicates \"**Improper authentication**\" as the root cause. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also supports this by stating, \"The vulnerability is due to **improper authentication** in the WordPress Post by Email feature (wp-mail.php).\" This aligns with CWE-287.\n\nThe vulnerability results in the disclosure of the user's email address, which fits the description of CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data).\n\nWhile CWE-287 is a class-level CWE, it is the most appropriate based on the available information. The more specific child CWEs, such as CWE-1390 and CWE-306, require more specific evidence, which is not available here.\n\nThe selection of CWE-287 and CWE-201 is based on the evidence provided and the relationships between them, ensuring an optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
