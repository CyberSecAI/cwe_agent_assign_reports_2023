The secondary relationship to consider is the peer relationship between CWE-415 and CWE-123, given that a double free can often lead to a write-what-where condition.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe415[\"CWE-415: Double Free\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on a Resource after Expiration\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe1341[\"CWE-1341: Multiple Releases of Same Resource or Handle\"]\n    cwe666[\"CWE-666: Operation on Resource Without Holding a Lock\"]\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n\n    cwe415 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe415 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1341\n    cwe415 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe415 -->|CHILDOF| cwe666\n    cwe415 -->|PEEROF| cwe416\n    cwe415 -->|PEEROF| cwe123\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe415 primary\n    class cwe123 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **Double-free** (CWE-415), which can lead to a write-what-where condition (CWE-123), ultimately resulting in arbitrary code execution and denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the provided evidence, strongly points to CWE-415 as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **Double-free** condition, making CWE-415 the most direct and accurate classification.\n\nThe evidence from \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms the **root_cause** as \"Double-free in the `pspdf_export` function\" and identifies \"Double-free vulnerability (CWE-415)\" as a weakness. The impact is described as \"Arbitrary code execution and denial of service.\"\n\nThe relationship graph further supports the selection of CWE-415, showing its connections to related weaknesses such as CWE-123 and CWE-416.\n\nCWE-415 is selected because it is the most specific and directly applicable CWE based on the provided evidence. It accurately represents the **Double-free** condition described in the vulnerability. The other CWEs considered either represent broader categories or different types of weaknesses.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
