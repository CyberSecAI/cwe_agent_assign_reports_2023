## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper neutralization of special elements** leading to **OS command injection**, allowing remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary commands.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified **Improper neutralization of special elements** used in an OS command as the root cause, leading to a **command injection** vulnerability. The retriever results and similar CVE descriptions suggested CWE-78, CWE-77, and CWE-89 as potential candidates.

The final decision was to assign CWE-78, as it directly matches the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which explicitly mentions "Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command ('OS Command Injection')". CWE-78 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction.

The primary CWE match for similar CVE Descriptions was CWE-89, but the vulnerability description explicitly refers to OS commands, which makes CWE-78 a more accurate fit.
