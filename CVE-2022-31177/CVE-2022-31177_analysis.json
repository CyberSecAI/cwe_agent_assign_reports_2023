I considered CWE-760 (Use of a One-Way Hash with a Predictable Salt) as a secondary concern because the vulnerability description mentions salted and hashed passwords. However, the root cause is that an authenticated admin user can query other users by their salted and hashed passwords strings, and the system allows filtering by partial hashed password strings leading to potential information leakage. CWE-202 is more appropriate because it focuses on the exposure of information via queries, which aligns with the vulnerability's root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe202[\"CWE-202: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries\"]\n    cwe1230[\"CWE-1230: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Metadata\"]\n    cwe760[\"CWE-760: Use of a One-Way Hash with a Predictable Salt\"]\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n\n    cwe202 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1230\n    cwe760 -->|CHILDOF| cwe916\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe202 primary\n    class cwe760 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper** handling of data queries, leading to the **exposure** of sensitive information:\n1.  The application allows authenticated admin users to make data queries on other users.\n2.  These queries can filter by partial password hashes.\n3.  The vulnerability results in the **exposure** of information, as partial password hashes and their respective users can be inferred.\n    CWE-202 captures the final impact of the information exposure through data queries.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the salted and hashed passwords in the Vulnerability Description made me consider CWE-760 (Use of a One-Way Hash with a Predictable Salt), but that focused on the hashing itself. The vulnerability is that the application allows filtering users by partial password hashes, which enables an authenticated admin user to infer partial password hashes and their corresponding users. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states, \"The system exposes the ability to filter users based on partial password hashes\" and \"The application does not properly validate or sanitize input used for filtering, allowing partial password hashes to be used\". Therefore, CWE-202 (Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries) is the most appropriate. It directly addresses the weakness where sensitive information is leaked through the ability to make queries based on partial password hashes.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
