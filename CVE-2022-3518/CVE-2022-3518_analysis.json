The CWE's base abstraction level is ideal for capturing the root cause. There are child relationships of CWE-79 such as CWE-80, CWE-83, CWE-84, CWE-85, CWE-86, and CWE-87. The retriever returned CWE-79 as the highest rated option.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe80[\"CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe80 -->|CHILDOF| cwe79\n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe80,cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves **improper input sanitization** as the root cause, which directly leads to cross-site scripting. The sequence is:\n\n1.  **Improper Input Sanitization:** User input for \"First Name/Middle Name/Last Name\" is not properly sanitized.\n2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79):** The unsanitized input is used in a web page, allowing malicious scripts to be executed.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which explicitly states that **improper input sanitization** leads to cross-site scripting.\n\nThe vulnerability description key phrases include:\n*   **rootcause:** **improper input sanitization**\n*   **impact:** cross-site scripting\n\nThe retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-79 as the most relevant, with a score of 0.548.\n\nCWE-80 was considered but not used because the description states \"The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\" This is too specific as the description did not provide this level of detail.\n\nThe selection of CWE-79 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **improper neutralization** of input leading to cross-site scripting, without being overly specific about the type of input or the exact method of **neutralization failure**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.",
