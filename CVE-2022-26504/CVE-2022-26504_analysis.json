While discouraged, it serves as a high-level classification. The retriever results suggest CWE-306 and CWE-1390 as more specific alternatives. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication) and CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) are both children of CWE-287, providing a more granular view of the authentication issue. The relationships highlight a hierarchy of authentication-related weaknesses, from general improper authentication to specific cases of missing or weak authentication.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe1390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe1390 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper authentication** (CWE-287), potentially leading to the ability to execute arbitrary code.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **improper authentication** as the core weakness. The retriever results pointed to CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) and CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) as potential candidates.\n\nThe evidence supports CWE-287 as the primary issue. According to the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\":\n\n- The `Veeam.Backup.PSManager.exe` process allows authentication using non-administrative domain credentials.\n- This **improper authentication** can lead to remote code execution.\n\nThis aligns with the description of CWE-287: \"When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.\"\n\nCWE-306 is a possible alternative, as the vulnerability description indicates that the system might be missing proper authentication checks for non-administrative users. However, the authentication process does exist, but it is insufficient. Therefore, it is not a case of completely missing authentication as described in CWE-306.\n\nCWE-1390 is also a possibility, as the authentication mechanism might be weak in that it allows non-administrative users to gain access.\n\nGiven that the authentication is present but insufficient, CWE-287 serves as the primary, higher-level classification, with CWE-306 and CWE-1390 being secondary classifications that provide more specific details.\n\nCWE-287 is at the Class level, and the mapping guidance discourages its use when lower-level CWEs are applicable. However, in this case, the evidence does not strongly support either CWE-306 or CWE-1390 exclusively, so CWE-287 is chosen as the primary classification. CWE-306 and CWE-1390 are still relevant, so they are included as secondary classifications.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n*Not Selected*: While relevant, it's more of a consequence of the authentication issue than the root cause.\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.

This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: Similar to CWE-274, it's a consequence rather than the root cause.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
