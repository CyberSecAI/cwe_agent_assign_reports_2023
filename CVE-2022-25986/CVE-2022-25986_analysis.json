While CWE-863, Incorrect Authorization is more specific, CWE-284 is chosen based on the broader scope of the **browse restriction bypass**, as authorization is one component of access control. CWE-200 is also a child of CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere), representing a potential impact of the access control issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe200 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **browse restriction bypass** (CWE-284) leading to the ability to obtain Scheduler data, which can be classified as **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the analysis focused on the **browse restriction bypass** as the primary weakness. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly states **CWE-284: Improper Access Control** as present. However, CWE-284 is a Pillar, which is discouraged. The next most specific CWE, **CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization**, is also considered, but doesn't fully capture the broad scope of the **browse restriction bypass**. The description indicates that **an attacker can obtain data from the Scheduler, which they should not have access to**, aligns with **CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**, as a consequence.\n\nThe evidence supports the conclusion that the root cause is **CWE-284: Improper Access Control**, but CWE-863 and CWE-200 are considered relevant secondary CWEs to describe the type of access control issue and the information exposure.\n\nThe selection of CWE-284 is influenced by the direct statement in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, even though it is discouraged. While CWE-863 is more specific, CWE-284 is used since the vulnerability is a **browse restriction bypass** and access control is a higher level that encapsulates authorization. CWE-200 is also included as a potential impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].\n\n## CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an externally controlled name or reference that resolves to a resource that is outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-8",
