It has a parent-child relationship with CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure). CWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength) is considered a related weakness and a potential child of CWE-693. The decision favored CWE-327 as the primary classification due to the explicit mention of \"**weak cryptographic algorithms**\" in the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe326[\"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    \n    cwe327 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe326 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe327 primary\n    class cwe326 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of weak cryptographic algorithms** (CWE-327), leading to the potential to **decrypt highly sensitive information**, which is the impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The key phrase \"**weak cryptographic algorithms**\" strongly suggests CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) as the primary weakness. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the vulnerability allows an attacker to decrypt highly sensitive information.\n\nCWE-327 is a Class-level CWE, and the mapping guidance suggests examining its children for a better fit. However, none of the children CWEs of CWE-327 directly match the provided information.\n\nCWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength) was also considered due to its similarity to the vulnerability description, but CWE-327 was chosen as the primary CWE due to the explicit mention of \"**weak cryptographic algorithms**\".\n\nThe selection of CWE-327 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **use of broken or risky cryptographic algorithms**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTwo separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
