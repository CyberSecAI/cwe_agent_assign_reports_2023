This error can lead to other issues such as CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write and CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow. CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound is a related issue that can occur when a value is too large for its container after a type conversion. The hierarchical relationships show that CWE-787 and CWE-122 are children of CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer. CWE-190 can precede CWE-119. These relationships help to understand how the initial truncation error can result in memory corruption.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe197[\"CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\"]\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe197 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe190\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe197 primary\n    class cwe787,cwe122,cwe190 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect type conversion of sizes from 64bit to 32bit integers** (CWE-197). This truncation can lead to an integer overflow (CWE-190) if the 64-bit value is larger than the maximum value representable by a 32-bit integer. The integer overflow can cause a smaller buffer than expected to be allocated, leading to a heap buffer overflow (CWE-122) and potentially an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). This memory corruption can then result in a crash.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis of the vulnerability description pointed to an **incorrect type conversion of sizes from 64bit to 32bit integers** as the root cause. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this with the statement, \"The vulnerability stems from an incorrect type conversion within the `nsStructuredCloneContainer::GetDataAsBase64` function. A 64-bit integer representing a size was being cast to a 32-bit integer without proper bounds checking. This led to an integer overflow.\"\n\nBased on this, the primary CWE is CWE-197 Numeric Truncation Error, which is a type of **incorrect type conversion of sizes from 64bit to 32bit integers** and is at the optimal level of specificity (Base). The subsequent integer overflow (CWE-190), heap buffer overflow (CWE-122) and out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) are consequences of this initial error.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the weakness based on the provided evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as
