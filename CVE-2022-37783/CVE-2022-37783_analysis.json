CWE-352 (CSRF) and CWE-79 (XSS) are related as potential attack vectors or prerequisites, but are not the root cause. CWE-201 is a base level CWE, providing sufficient specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe352 -->|REQUIREDBY| cwe201\n    cwe79 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe201\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe352,cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper inclusion of password hashes** in CSRF tokens (CWE-201). This can then be exploited through CSRF (CWE-352) or XSS (CWE-79) to extract the hashes, leading to potential account compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed to CWE-201 as the primary weakness due to the **disclosure of password hashes** in CSRF tokens. The retriever results and CVE description support this. While CSRF (CWE-352) and XSS (CWE-79) were considered, they are enablers or potential attack vectors rather than the fundamental flaw.\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states: \"The vulnerability stems from the **improper mixing of a user's hashed password** into the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens generated by Craft CMS.\" This directly supports CWE-201.\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CSRF and XSS can be related to information exposure, but the core issue is the insertion of sensitive data (password hashes) into the tokens.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-201 being a Base-level weakness that directly addresses the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
