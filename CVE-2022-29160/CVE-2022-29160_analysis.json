The application does not properly remove sensitive data after a user account is deleted. |\n| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. Sensitive information is stored, and if not properly removed, it may exist in cleartext. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is the ChildOf relationship between CWE-459 and CWE-404 (Improper Resource Shutdown or Release). CWE-459 is a more specific case of CWE-404, focusing on the incomplete removal of resources, which aligns well with the vulnerability description. The chain relationship of `CWE-459` `CanPrecede` `CWE-201` (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) could be applicable if the uncleared data is later transmitted, but it's not explicitly stated in the provided description. `CWE-459` also has an overlap with permissions and containment, indicating potential secondary issues related to access control.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe459[\"CWE-459: Incomplete Cleanup\"]\n    cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe459 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    cwe312 --> cwe459\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe459 primary\n    class cwe404,cwe312 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper** or **insufficient** removal of sensitive data after account deletion, which is captured by CWE-459. This can then lead to the **impact** of data leakage, where sensitive tokens, images, and user-related details remain accessible. If the data is stored in cleartext, `CWE-312` could apply. The chain is: Incomplete Cleanup (CWE-459) -> Data Leakage (Impact).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-459 (Incomplete Cleanup) because the root cause of the vulnerability is that the Nextcloud Android app does not properly remove sensitive data after a user account is deleted. The evidence to support this is: \"Root Cause of Vulnerability: The vulnerability stems from the Nextcloud Android app not properly removing sensitive data after a user account is deleted.\" The pull request #9644 on Github addresses this issue, where the commit description is \"Clean up AccountRemovalWork\" which further supports the classification of `CWE-459`.\n\nCWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) is considered as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability description mentions that sensitive tokens, images, and user related details exist after deletion of a user account. If this data is stored in cleartext, CWE-312 would be applicable. The provided information does not explicitly confirm cleartext storage but implies the possibility.\n\nThe retriever results showed CWE-459 as the top hit which supports this selection. Other CWEs like CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation), CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication), and CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information) were considered but deemed less relevant as they do not directly address the **incomplete cleanup** aspect of the vulnerability.\nThe chosen CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, providing a specific and accurate representation
