## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-459 | Incomplete Cleanup | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The application does not properly remove sensitive data after a user account is deleted. |
| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. Sensitive information is stored, and if not properly removed, it may exist in cleartext. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is the ChildOf relationship between CWE-459 and CWE-404 (Improper Resource Shutdown or Release). CWE-459 is a more specific case of CWE-404, focusing on the incomplete removal of resources, which aligns well with the vulnerability description. The chain relationship of `CWE-459` `CanPrecede` `CWE-201` (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) could be applicable if the uncleared data is later transmitted, but it's not explicitly stated in the provided description. `CWE-459` also has an overlap with permissions and containment, indicating potential secondary issues related to access control.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper** or **insufficient** removal of sensitive data after account deletion, which is captured by CWE-459. This can then lead to the **impact** of data leakage, where sensitive tokens, images, and user-related details remain accessible. If the data is stored in cleartext, `CWE-312` could apply. The chain is: Incomplete Cleanup (CWE-459) -> Data Leakage (Impact).

## Summary of Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-459 (Incomplete Cleanup) because the root cause of the vulnerability is that the Nextcloud Android app does not properly remove sensitive data after a user account is deleted. The evidence to support this is: "Root Cause of Vulnerability: The vulnerability stems from the Nextcloud Android app not properly removing sensitive data after a user account is deleted." The pull request #9644 on Github addresses this issue, where the commit description is "Clean up AccountRemovalWork" which further supports the classification of `CWE-459`.

CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) is considered as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability description mentions that sensitive tokens, images, and user related details exist after deletion of a user account. If this data is stored in cleartext, CWE-312 would be applicable. The provided information does not explicitly confirm cleartext storage but implies the possibility.

The retriever results showed CWE-459 as the top hit which supports this selection. Other CWEs like CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation), CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication), and CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information) were considered but deemed less relevant as they do not directly address the **incomplete cleanup** aspect of the vulnerability.
The chosen CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, providing a specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.
Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-459: Incomplete Cleanup
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly "clean up" and remove temporary or supporting resources after they have been used.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes
