CWE-190 can precede CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), which is a parent of CWE-787. This shows a clear chain of causation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) in the `pixman_sample_floor_y` function, which results in an incorrect y-coordinate. This incorrect value is then used in the `pixman_rasterize_trapezoid` function, ultimately leading to an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787) in the `rasterize_edges_8` function due to an excessively large value being passed.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a high confidence in the assigned CWEs based on the provided evidence. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions an **integer overflow** and an **out-of-bounds write**, supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is as follows:\n*   \"In libpixman in Pixman before 0.42.2, there is an **out-of-bounds write** (aka heap-based buffer overflow) in rasterize_edges_8 due to an **integer overflow** in pixman_sample_floor_y.\"\n*   \"**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow within the `pixman_sample_floor_y` function of the pixman library. This overflow leads to an incorrect calculation of the y-coordinate, which is then used in subsequent rasterization steps.\"\n*   \"**Out-of-Bounds Write:** The incorrect y-coordinate calculated by `pixman_sample_floor_y` is passed to the `pixman_rasterize_trapezoid` function. This in turn leads to an out-of-bounds write in the `memset` operation within the `rasterize_edges_8` function due to a too large `b` being passed to `pixman_rasterize_edges`. This means a memory region outside the allocated buffer is written to.\"\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-190 can precede CWE-119, which is a parent of CWE-787, supporting the chain of events in the vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-190 being the root cause and CWE-787 being the direct consequence of the overflow.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
