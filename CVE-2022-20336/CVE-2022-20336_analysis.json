While CWE-862 is a Class, it is the closest available based on the provided information. CWE-285 Improper Authorization is a parent of CWE-862, but is discouraged. CWE-223, Omission of Security-relevant Information, is a potential secondary weakness due to the information disclosure, but the root cause is the **missing permission check**, making CWE-862 more directly relevant.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe223[\"CWE-223: Omission of Security-relevant Information\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe223 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission check** (CWE-862), which leads to the disclosure of information about allow-listed applications.\n  - Root Cause: **Missing permission check** (CWE-862)\n  - Impact: Information disclosure (CWE-223, potentially, but not the root cause)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **missing permission check**, as stated in the vulnerability description. The evidence lies in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section, which explicitly mentions \"**missing permission check**\" as the root cause.\n> **rootcause:** **missing permission check**\n\nThis aligns well with CWE-862's description: \"The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\"\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section does not provide enough detail to select a more specific CWE. While the vulnerability results in information disclosure, the underlying cause is the **missing permission check**, making CWE-862 the more appropriate choice.\n\nCWE-223 (Omission of Security-relevant Information) was considered because the impact involves information disclosure. However, CWE-223 is more about not recording or displaying information, whereas the primary issue here is the **missing permission check** that leads to unauthorized access to information. Therefore, CWE-862 is the primary and most specific CWE.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
