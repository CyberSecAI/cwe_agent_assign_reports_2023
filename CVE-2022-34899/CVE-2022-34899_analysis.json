This CWE has a child relationship with CWE-362, indicating that it is a specific type of race condition. CWE-59, Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following'), is a secondary CWE because the vulnerability involves using a symbolic link to exploit the TOCTOU condition. CWE-363, Race Condition Enabling Link Following, is a child of CWE-367 and `CanPrecede` CWE-59, showing the potential chain of events.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe59[\"CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\"]\n    cwe363[\"CWE-363: Race Condition Enabling Link Following\"]\n    cwe363 -->|CHILDOF| cwe367\n    cwe363 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe59\n    cwe367 -->|CanPrecede| cwe59\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe367 primary\n    class cwe59,cwe363 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **TOCTOU** vulnerability (CWE-367) where the Parallels service checks the state of a file. An attacker then manipulates the file system, replacing the original file with a symbolic link, thus leading to **improper link resolution** (CWE-59). This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The key phrase \"By creating a symbolic link, an attacker can abuse the service to execute a file\" directly points to the exploitation method. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"The vulnerability is a Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) issue within the Parallels service\" and \"Attackers can exploit this by creating a symbolic link to a malicious file after the service has performed the initial validation check\".\n\nCWE-367 is selected as the primary CWE because the core issue is the race condition. CWE-59 is included as a secondary CWE because the symbolic link is the method used to exploit the race condition. The abstraction levels (Base) are appropriate as they represent the specific weaknesses involved.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   **CWE-427 (Count: 4) - Uncontrolled Search Path Element**: The primary match from \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" is not chosen as it doesn't accurately describe the **TOCTOU** vulnerability exploited via symbolic links.\n*   **CWE-269 (Count: 2) - Improper Privilege Management**: This is a high-level class that is too general.\n*   **CWE-59 - Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')**: Included as a secondary factor, but not the primary cause.\n*   **CWE-732 - Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource**: While privilege escalation is the impact, the root cause is not related to permission assignment itself but the **TOCTOU** condition.\n*   **CWE-250 - Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**: The root cause is not the service running with unnecessary privileges but the race condition that allows the exploit.\n*   **CWE-1386 - Insecure Operation on Windows Junction / Mount Point**: Specific to Windows, while the description does not mention the OS.\n*   **CWE-20 - Improper Input Validation**: While input is involved, the core of the weakness is the race condition, not the lack of validation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 8021.65\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 8137.43\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
