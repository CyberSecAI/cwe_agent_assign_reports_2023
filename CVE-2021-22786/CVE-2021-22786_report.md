# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2021-22786

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Discouraged: However, it is used here because the root cause is an information exposure issue. |
| CWE-522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review: May be applicable since application password hashes may be exposed. |
| CWE-497 | Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed: May be applicable since system information stored on the memory of the controller is exposed. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-200, which is a class-level CWE. It has child CWEs such as CWE-497 and peer CWEs such as CWE-522. While CWE-200 is discouraged for being too general, it fits because the vulnerability is fundamentally about exposing sensitive information. CWE-497 and CWE-522 are more specific and could also be applicable depending on the exact nature of the exposed information.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient protection** of sensitive information in the controller's memory. This leads to the **exposure of sensitive information** such as application password hashes and project data during Modbus TCP communication. The final impact is that an attacker could gain read access to the controller's memory and extract sensitive data.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **information exposure**. The vulnerability description clearly states "A CWE-200 **Information Exposure** vulnerability exists" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary highlights "An Information Exposure vulnerability exists due to **insufficient protection of sensitive information** stored in the controller's memory during Modbus TCP communication."

The retriever results and graph relationships helped refine the selection. While CWE-200 is a class-level CWE and is generally discouraged, the specific nature of this vulnerability as an information exposure issue makes it the most appropriate primary CWE. CWE-497 and CWE-522 are considered secondary candidates as they represent more specific aspects of the information exposure.

The decision to use CWE-200 is justified by the direct evidence in the vulnerability description and the CVE summary. While more specific CWEs exist, the overarching issue is the exposure of sensitive information, making CWE-200 the most fitting primary classification. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, capturing the essence of the vulnerability while acknowledging potential contributing factors.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.



## CWE-213: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product's intended functionality exposes information to certain actors in accordance with the developer's security policy, but this information is regarded as sensitive according to the intended security policies of other stakeholders such as the product's administrator, users, or others whose information is being processed.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].



## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is "asymmetric."

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or
