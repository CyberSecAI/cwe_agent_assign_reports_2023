It is a child of CWE-402 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere). The secondary CWE, CWE-280, highlights the broader issue of improper handling of insufficient permissions, representing a related but less specific aspect of the vulnerability. The relationship indicates that the dangling cursor leads to unauthorized access due to insufficient permission checks.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe619[\"CWE-619: Dangling Database Cursor ('Cursor Injection')\"]\n    cwe402[\"CWE-402: Improper Shutdown or Release of Resource\"]\n    cwe280[\"CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\"]\n\n    cwe619 -->|CHILDOF| cwe402\n    cwe619 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe280\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe619 primary\n    class cwe280 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of root cause and weaknesses is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** Failure to properly close database connections upon user deletion.\n2.  **Weakness:** Dangling database cursor (CWE-619).\n3.  **Weakness:** Improper handling of insufficient permissions or privileges (CWE-280).\n4.  **Impact:** Deleted users can access unauthorized data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and weaknesses described in the vulnerability report. The primary weakness is the **dangling database cursor** (CWE-619), which **allows deleted users to access unauthorized data**. This is supported by the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" which indicates that \"database connections for deleted users are not properly closed,\" leading to \"active connections that can still be used to access data.\"\n\nCWE-619 is chosen because it specifically addresses the technical mechanism of the vulnerability which is **dangling database cursors** due to the failure to close database connections. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" indicates a failure to terminate database connections upon user deletion, leading to exploitable open connections.\n\nCWE-280 is considered as a secondary weakness because the **dangling cursor** allows **access to unauthorized data**, which means the system **does not properly handle insufficient permissions or privileges**. This is explicitly stated in the vulnerability description: \"allow deleted users to access unauthorized data.\"\n\nOther CWEs like CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) were considered but deemed less specific. CWE-284 is too high-level, while CWE-287 is not directly related to the root cause.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the technical weakness (CWE-619) and the resulting access control issue (CWE-280) described in the vulnerability report.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
