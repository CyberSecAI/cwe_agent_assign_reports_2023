# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2022-30746

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE |
| CWE-213 | Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship considered was the ChildOf relationship, as several candidates were children of CWE-284 and CWE-285, which represent broader categories of authentication and authorization issues. We selected CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) due to its more direct relevance to the "missing caller check". Another parent-child relationship exists between CWE-200 (Information Exposure) and CWE-213 (Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies) which makes sense due to the impact of the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with a **missing caller check** (CWE-862), which allows an attacker to bypass authorization and **access sensitive information**. This can be viewed as a direct consequence of the authorization failure.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **missing caller check** in SmartThings. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly states this. The vulnerability description also highlights the impact of accessing sensitive information.

The Retriever Results suggested several potential CWEs, including CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function), and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication). Among these, CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) appears most fitting due to the explicit mention of a **missing caller check**, which directly relates to authorization.

CWE-213 (Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies) was considered a secondary candidate because the impact of the vulnerability is access to sensitive information. However, the root cause is more accurately described by the authorization issue.

The final decision to map to CWE-862 is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary, as well as the relevance of the CWE description to the root cause. The selection of CWE-862 is at the Class level. While a more specific Base level CWE would be optimal, there isn't sufficient information to determine a more specific cause, but this is the most accurate that can be determined from the evidence.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.81
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why it was not selected:** The vulnerability description does not describe a XSS vulnerability.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

**Why it was not selected:** The vulnerability description does not describe an injection vulnerability.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

**Why it was not selected:** The vulnerability description does not describe an encoding or escaping issue.

## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. This is often a component in phishing attacks.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

**Why it was not selected:** The vulnerability description does not describe a UI misrepresentation issue.

## CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why it was not selected:** The vulnerability description does not describe an XML External Entity issue.

## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why it was not selected:** The vulnerability description does not describe an HTTP Request/Response Splitting issue.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why it was not selected:** The vulnerability description does not describe a cleartext transmission issue.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why it was not selected:** The vulnerability description does not describe an incomplete list of disallowed inputs.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to
