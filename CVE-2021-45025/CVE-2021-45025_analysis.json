CWE-315 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in a Cookie) is a variant of CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information), which in turn is a child of CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data). Because the vulnerability description specifically mentions the storage of sensitive information in a cookie, CWE-315 is the most specific and appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe315[\"CWE-315: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in a Cookie\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    \n    cwe315 -->|CHILDOF| cwe312\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe315 primary\n    class cwe312,cwe311 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **rootcause**, which is the **cleartext storage of sensitive information**. The sensitive information is specifically stored in a cookie. This leads to the potential compromise of the sensitive information if an attacker gains access to the cookie.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the **rootcause** of the vulnerability. The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** clearly states that the **rootcause** is \"**cleartext storage of sensitive information**\". The description also mentions that the sensitive information is stored in a cookie.\n\nBased on this information, the primary candidate was CWE-315 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in a Cookie). This CWE is a variant of CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) and provides a more specific classification.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-315 was heavily influenced by the provided evidence and the hierarchical relationship between CWEs. The \"**rootcause:** **cleartext storage of sensitive information**\" phrase directly supports the selection of CWE-315.\n\nThe retriever results also support this decision, with CWE-315 being the top-ranked CWE. The mapping guidance for CWE-315 explicitly states that it is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level for mapping vulnerabilities.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-315 is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description, the hierarchical relationship between CWEs, and the mapping guidance provided by MITRE. This CWE is at the optimal level of specificity and accurately represents the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-316: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext in memory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information without properly limiting read or write access by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
