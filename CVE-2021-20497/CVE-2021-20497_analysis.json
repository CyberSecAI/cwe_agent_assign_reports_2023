The vulnerability involves the use of **weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms**, which aligns with the description of CWE-327. The impact, which is that an attacker could **decrypt highly sensitive information**, is also consistent with the implications of using a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm. |\n| CWE-326 | Inadequate Encryption Strength | 0.7  | Class  | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary candidate.

It has a peer relationship with CWE-311 (Missing Cryptographic Step) and is a child of CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure). The related CWE, CWE-326, is also a Class-level CWE and a child of CWE-693. Choosing CWE-327 is favored because it directly relates to the use of risky cryptographic algorithms as a root cause, whereas CWE-326 focuses on the result of using a scheme that is not strong enough.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe326[\"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Cryptographic Step\"]\n\n    cwe327 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe326 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe327 --|PEEROF| cwe311\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe327 primary\n    class cwe326 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms (CWE-327)**. This leads to the **ability for an attacker to decrypt highly sensitive information**. This represents the impact of the **weakness**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-327 as the primary candidate based on the \"**weak cryptographic algorithms**\" root cause and the ability for an attacker to \"**decrypt highly sensitive information**\".\n\nThe retriever results supported this selection, with CWE-327 being the top candidate. The relationship analysis confirmed that CWE-327, a Class-level CWE, is more appropriate than its parent CWE-693 because it specifically addresses the cryptographic aspect of the **weakness**. Also, the description uses the term \"**weaker than expected**\" which can translate to **Inadequate Encryption Strength (CWE-326)**.\n\nThe final decision to select CWE-327 and CWE-326 is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions \"**weak cryptographic algorithms**.\" This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-327 and CWE-326, making it the most accurate and specific classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:",
