The vulnerability specifically mentions a **default password**, making CWE-1393 the most specific and appropriate choice. CWE-1188 is also relevant as the **default password** represents an insecure default configuration.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1393[\"CWE-1393: Use of Default Password\"]\n    cwe1392[\"CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n    cwe1188[\"CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default\"]\n    \n    cwe1393 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1392\n    cwe1392 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1391\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1393 primary\n    class cwe1188 secondary\n    class cwe1392,cwe1391 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **default password** being set for the admin account, leading to potential unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description which clearly states that Open5GS 2.1.3 uses a **default password** of 1423 for the admin account. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section also highlights \"**default password**\" as a key **weakness**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the existence of the **default password** and its impact, \"the webui automatically creates a default administrative account with the username \"admin\" and password \"1423\"\". This strong evidence supports the selection of CWE-1393 (Use of Default Password) as the primary CWE. CWE-1188 is also considered because the use of a **default password** is a form of insecure default initialization.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1393: Use of Default Password\n**CWE-1393 (Use of Default Password)** is the most accurate because the **weakness** lies in the use of a default password specifically. The description of CWE-1393 directly matches the vulnerability: \"The product uses default passwords for potentially critical functionality.\" The \"Mapping Guidance\" for CWE-1393 states, \"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\"\n\n## CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default\n**CWE-1188 (Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default)** is a secondary candidate because the **default password** is an example of an insecure default. The description of CWE-1188 is \"The product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure.\" The use of a **default password** is the initialization of the admin account with an insecure **default**.\n\n**CWEs Considered but Not Used**\n\n*   CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials): While a **default password** can be considered a type of hard-coded credential, the vulnerability specifically mentions a default password, making CWE-1393 a more accurate and specific classification.\n*   CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password): Similar to CWE-798, this is less specific than CWE-1393, which explicitly focuses on default passwords.\n*   CWE-1392 (Use of Default Credentials): This is a parent of CWE-1393. Since the issue is specifically a password, CWE-1393 is more precise.\n*   CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function): While the **default password** weakens authentication, the primary issue is the existence of the **default password** itself, not the complete absence of authentication.\n*   CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key): This is not applicable because the vulnerability involves a password, not a cryptographic key.\n*   CWE-472 (External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter): This is not applicable as the issue isn't about external control of parameters.\n*   CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison): This is not applicable as the vulnerability doesn't involve incorrect comparisons.\n*   CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password): This is not applicable because the vulnerability doesn't mention storing passwords in plaintext.",
