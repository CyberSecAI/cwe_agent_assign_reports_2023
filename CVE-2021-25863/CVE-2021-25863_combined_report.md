## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **default password** being set for the admin account, leading to potential unauthorized access.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the vulnerability description which clearly states that Open5GS 2.1.3 uses a **default password** of 1423 for the admin account. The "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" section also highlights "**default password**" as a key **weakness**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the existence of the **default password** and its impact, "the webui automatically creates a default administrative account with the username "admin" and password "1423"". This strong evidence supports the selection of CWE-1393 (Use of Default Password) as the primary CWE. CWE-1188 is also considered because the use of a **default password** is a form of insecure default initialization.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-1393: Use of Default Password
**CWE-1393 (Use of Default Password)** is the most accurate because the **weakness** lies in the use of a default password specifically. The description of CWE-1393 directly matches the vulnerability: "The product uses default passwords for potentially critical functionality." The "Mapping Guidance" for CWE-1393 states, "This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities."

## CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default
**CWE-1188 (Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default)** is a secondary candidate because the **default password** is an example of an insecure default. The description of CWE-1188 is "The product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure." The use of a **default password** is the initialization of the admin account with an insecure **default**.

**CWEs Considered but Not Used**

*   CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials): While a **default password** can be considered a type of hard-coded credential, the vulnerability specifically mentions a default password, making CWE-1393 a more accurate and specific classification.
*   CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password): Similar to CWE-798, this is less specific than CWE-1393, which explicitly focuses on default passwords.
*   CWE-1392 (Use of Default Credentials): This is a parent of CWE-1393. Since the issue is specifically a password, CWE-1393 is more precise.
*   CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function): While the **default password** weakens authentication, the primary issue is the existence of the **default password** itself, not the complete absence of authentication.
*   CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key): This is not applicable because the vulnerability involves a password, not a cryptographic key.
*   CWE-472 (External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter): This is not applicable as the issue isn't about external control of parameters.
*   CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison): This is not applicable as the vulnerability doesn't involve incorrect comparisons.
*   CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password): This is not applicable because the vulnerability doesn't mention storing passwords in plaintext.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-25863

## Vulnerability Description
Open5GS 2.1.3 listens on 0.0.0.03000 and has a **default password** of 1423 for the admin account.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **default password**
- **product:** Open5GS
- **version:** 2.1.3

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the default configuration of the `webui` component of Open5GS. Specifically:

1.  **Default Binding to 0.0.0.0:** The webui server, by default, binds to `0.0.0.0:3000`. This means that the control panel is accessible from any IP address, including the public internet (WAN), if the server is exposed without proper network restrictions.
2.  **Default Credentials:** If no user accounts are present in the MongoDB database, the webui automatically creates a default administrative account with the username "admin" and password "1423".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Default Configuration:** The combination of listening on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`) and a default, weak, hardcoded password creates a significant security risk.
*   **Exposure of Management Interface:** The webui control panel, intended for management, is exposed to potentially unauthorized users due to the default configuration.
*   **Reliance on Default Credentials:** The automatic creation of a default admin user with a well-known password allows for easy exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Takeover:** An attacker who can access the webui interface can log in using the default credentials and gain full administrative control of the Open5GS instance.
*   **Data Breach and Manipulation:** This could lead to unauthorized access to network configuration, data modification, and potentially denial of service.
*   **Compromise of Network:** Full control over the Open5GS instance could compromise the entire network it is managing.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Exposure:** The vulnerability is exploitable by anyone who can reach the exposed port 3000 of the Open5GS server. This could include:
    *   **Direct WAN Access:** If the server is directly connected to the internet without firewall or network address translation (NAT).
    *   **LAN Access:** If an attacker is present in the same local network as the vulnerable Open5GS server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to have network access to the webui interface on port 3000.
*   **Knowledge of Default Credentials:** The attacker must be aware of the default username (`admin`) and password (`1423`). This information is available in the source code.

**Mitigation:**

The issue was mitigated with the following changes:

*   **Production mode:** In production mode, the server no longer creates the default admin/1423 account.
*   **WebUI Installation script:** The installation script now creates a default admin account if none exists during setup.
*   **Bind to localhost:** The webui was changed to use `localhost` by default.

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain complete control of the open5gs webui if the service was exposed to the internet, due to the default listening address and creation of a default admin user with a weak password.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-1393: Use of Default Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses default passwords for potentially critical functionality.

### Extended Description
It is common practice for products to be designed to use default passwords for authentication. The rationale is to simplify the manufacturing process or the system administrator's task of installation and deployment into an enterprise. However, if admins do not change the defaults, then it makes it easier for attackers to quickly bypass authentication across multiple organizations. There are many lists of default passwords and default-password scanning tools that are easily available from the World Wide Web.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1392

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30270:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses default credentials for some SSH accounts
- **CVE-2022-2336:** OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) industrial automation product has a default password
- **CVE-2021-38759:** microcontroller board has default password




## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.

### Extended Description


A hard-coded password typically leads to a significant authentication failure that can be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:

```
		Inbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.
		Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.
```
In the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.

The Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry could be split into multiple variants: an inbound variant (as seen in the second demonstrative example) and an outbound variant (as seen in the first demonstrative example). These variants are likely to have different consequences, detectability, etc. More importantly, from a vulnerability theory perspective, they could be characterized as different behaviors.



### Observed Examples

- **CVE-2021-37555:** Telnet service for IoT feeder for dogs and cats has hard-coded password [REF-1288]
- **CVE-2021-35033:** Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART port




## CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure.

### Extended Description


Developers often choose default values that leave the product as open and easy to use as possible out-of-the-box, under the assumption that the administrator can (or should) change the default value. However, this ease-of-use comes at a cost when the default is insecure and the administrator does not change it.

- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.




## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

### Extended Description


By design, authentication protocols try to ensure that attackers must perform brute force attacks if they do not know the credentials such as a key or password. However, when these credentials are easily predictable or even fixed (as with default or hard-coded passwords and keys), then the attacker can defeat the mechanism without relying on brute force.


Credentials may be weak for different reasons, such as:


  - Hard-coded (i.e., static and unchangeable by the administrator)

  - Default (i.e., the same static value across different deployments/installations, but able to be changed by the administrator)

  - Predictable (i.e., generated in a way that produces unique credentials across deployments/installations, but can still be guessed with reasonable efficiency)

Even if a new, unique credential is intended to be generated for each product installation, if the generation is predictable, then that may also simplify guessing attacks.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The main difference between the use of hard-coded passwords and the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys is the false sense of security that the former conveys. Many people believe that simply hashing a hard-coded password before storage will protect the information from malicious users. However, many hashes are reversible (or at least vulnerable to brute force attacks) -- and further, many authentication protocols simply request the hash itself, making it no better than a password.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29960:** Engineering Workstation uses hard-coded cryptographic keys that could allow for unathorized filesystem access and privilege escalation
- **CVE-2022-30271:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used by default.
- **CVE-2020-10884:** WiFi router service has a hard-coded encryption key, allowing root access




## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

### Extended Description


If a web product does not properly protect assumed-immutable values from modification in hidden form fields, parameters, cookies, or URLs, this can lead to modification of critical data. Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.


For example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is a primary weakness for many other weaknesses and functional consequences, including XSS, SQL injection, path disclosure, and file inclusion.

**[Theoretical]** This is a technology-specific MAID problem.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-0108:** Forum product allows spoofed messages of other users via hidden form fields for name and e-mail address.
- **CVE-2000-0253:** Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.
- **CVE-2000-0254:** Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.




## CWE-697: Incorrect Comparison
**Abstraction:** Pillar
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product compares two entities in a security-relevant context, but the comparison is incorrect, which may lead to resultant weaknesses.

### Extended Description


This Pillar covers several possibilities:


  - the comparison checks one factor incorrectly;

  - the comparison should consider multiple factors, but it does not check at least one of those factors at all;

  - the comparison checks the wrong factor.



### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
None

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. However, sometimes this weakness is forced to be used due to the lack of in-depth weakness research. See Research Gaps.
**Comments:** Where feasible, consider children or descendants of this entry instead.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Research Gap]** 

Weaknesses related to this Pillar appear to be under-studied, especially with respect to classification schemes. Input from academic and other communities could help identify and resolve gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE.


**[Maintenance]** This entry likely has some relationships with case sensitivity (CWE-178), but case sensitivity is a factor in other types of weaknesses besides comparison. Also, in cryptography, certain attacks are possible when certain comparison operations do not take place in constant time, causing a timing-related information leak (CWE-208).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-3116:** Chain: Python-based HTTP Proxy server uses the wrong boolean operators (CWE-480) causing an incorrect comparison (CWE-697) that identifies an authN failure if all three conditions are met instead of only one, allowing bypass of the proxy authentication (CWE-1390)
- **CVE-2020-15811:** Chain: Proxy uses a substring search instead of parsing the Transfer-Encoding header (CWE-697), allowing request splitting (CWE-113) and cache poisoning
- **CVE-2016-10003:** Proxy performs incorrect comparison of request headers, leading to infoleak




## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.

### Extended Description
Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.
