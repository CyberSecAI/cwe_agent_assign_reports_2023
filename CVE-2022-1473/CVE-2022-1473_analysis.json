CWE-459 (Incomplete Cleanup) is a child of CWE-404 (Improper Resource Shutdown or Release). The vulnerability involves a memory leak due to a bug in `OPENSSL_LH_flush()`, which prevents the reuse of memory occupied by removed hash table entries, which is an instance of improper resource management, particularly memory.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe459[\"CWE-459: Incomplete Cleanup\"]\n    cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\"]\n\n    cwe401\n    cwe459 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe401 primary\n    class cwe459 secondary\n    class cwe404 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a bug in the `OPENSSL_LH_flush()` function, leading to a **memory leak** (CWE-401), which results in unbounded memory usage and ultimately a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a memory leak in OpenSSL due to a bug in the `OPENSSL_LH_flush()` function, which prevents the reuse of memory occupied by removed hash table entries.\n\n*   The primary weakness is the **missing release of memory** (CWE-401). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly states: \"The improper memory management within `OPENSSL_LH_flush()` leads to a memory leak. Each time certificates or keys are decoded, memory is allocated but not properly freed.\" This is strong evidence supporting the selection of CWE-401.\n\n*   CWE-459 (Incomplete Cleanup) is considered as a secondary CWE because `OPENSSL_LH_flush()` function which empties a hash table, contains a bug that breaks reuse of the memory occupied by the removed hash table entries.\n\nThe selection of CWE-401 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the memory leak described in the vulnerability. The supporting evidence and relationship analysis reinforce the decision.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
