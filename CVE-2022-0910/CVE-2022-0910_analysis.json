It is a child of CWE-1390 \"Weak Authentication\" and CWE-654 \"Reliance on a Single Factor in a Security Decision\". CWE-1390 is a Class level CWE and a parent of CWE-308. CWE-287 \"Improper Authentication\" is a parent of CWE-1390. The hierarchical structure helped in refining the selection towards the more specific CWE-308.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe308[\"CWE-308: Use of Single-factor Authentication\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe654[\"CWE-654: Reliance on a Single Factor in a Security Decision\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe308 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe308 -->|CHILDOF| cwe654\n    cwe1390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe308 primary\n    class cwe1390,cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **downgrade from two-factor authentication to one-factor authentication**, which leads to bypassing the second authentication phase.\n  - Root Cause: **Downgrade from two-factor authentication to one-factor authentication**\n  - Weakness: Use of single-factor authentication (CWE-308)\n  - Impact: Bypass of the second authentication phase, leading to unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a **downgrade from two-factor authentication to one-factor authentication**. This indicates a reliance on a single factor where multiple factors were intended. CWE-308 \"Use of Single-factor Authentication\" directly addresses this scenario.\n\nThe vulnerability description key phrases include \"**downgrade from two-factor authentication to one-factor authentication**\" and \"**bypass the second authentication phase**\", which aligns with the description of CWE-308.\n\nCWE-1390 \"Weak Authentication\" and CWE-287 \"Improper Authentication\" were considered but deemed less specific. The **downgrade** aspect specifically points to a reduction to single-factor, making CWE-308 the more accurate choice. The Retriever Results also list CWE-308 as a candidate.\n\nBased on the evidence, the hierarchical relationships, and the mapping guidance, CWE-308 is the most appropriate and specific classification for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
