It's a child of CWE-119 **(Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer)**, but CWE-787 is more specific. CWE-416 **(Use After Free)** and CWE-123 **(Write-what-where Condition)** are considered as potential secondary CWEs due to the general nature of the **memory corruption**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n    cwe843[\"CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe123 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe843 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe416,cwe123,cwe843 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the processing of maliciously crafted web content, leading to **memory corruption**, and ultimately resulting in code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nBased on the provided evidence, the primary weakness is a **memory corruption** issue. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly states that the **root cause of the vulnerability** is a **memory corruption issue**. The vulnerability description mentions that processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to code execution.\n\nThe retriever results show that CWE-787 **(Out-of-bounds Write)** has the highest score and is a base-level CWE, which aligns with the goal of identifying the **root cause**. While the description is vague, the term **\"memory corruption\"** is often associated with out-of-bounds write conditions.\n\nCWE-416 **(Use After Free)**, CWE-123 **(Write-what-where Condition)**, and CWE-843 **(Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion'))** were considered as secondary CWEs.
