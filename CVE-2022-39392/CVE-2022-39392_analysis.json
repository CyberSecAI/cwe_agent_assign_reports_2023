CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is related because the allocator failed to create an appropriate virtual memory mapping.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    \n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **incorrect virtual memory mapping** due to a configuration issue in the pooling instance allocator (`InstanceLimitsmemory_pages` set to zero). This leads to out-of-bounds reads and writes, allowing access to memory outside the WebAssembly sandbox.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified that the vulnerability stemmed from an incorrect virtual memory mapping, which led to out-of-bounds reads and writes. The Retriever Results highlighted CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) as a top candidate, which aligns with the impact of the vulnerability. Also, CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is a possible candidate, since the **incorrect virtual memory mapping** is due to a configuration issue in the pooling instance allocator (`InstanceLimitsmemory_pages` set to zero).\n\nThe evidence supporting CWE-125 is: \"out of bounds reads/writes can successfully read/write memory unrelated to the wasm sandbox.\" The evidence supporting CWE-770 is: \"the pooling allocators configuration would not create an appropriate virtual memory mapping\".\n\nThe selection of CWE-125 is based on the direct impact of the vulnerability, while CWE-770 is considered as a contributing factor related to the resource allocation process. CWE-125 is the primary weakness due to the out-of-bounds read/write condition.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
