This hierarchy reflects a progression from general access control issues to more specific authorization flaws. The decision to choose CWE-863 is based on the fact that the vulnerability description explicitly mentions an authorization check that is performed incorrectly, making it a more precise fit than its parent classes.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **Improper Authorization** (**CWE-285**) in the Video Editor application. This leads to an **Incorrect Authorization** (**CWE-863**) implementation, allowing a local attacker to bypass intended access restrictions. The final impact is unauthorized access to internal application data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and the summary of CVE-2022-36852. The description explicitly states an **Improper Authorization** vulnerability.\n\nThe provided CVE reference link content summary also supports this:\n\n*   \"**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to improper authorization within the Video Editor application.\"\n*   \"**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** **Improper Authorization**: The Video Editor application does not properly validate broadcast intents, leading to unauthorized access.\"\n\nThe retriever results also suggest **CWE-284**, **CWE-285**, and **CWE-863** as potential candidates. However, given that an authorization check exists but is implemented incorrectly, **CWE-863** is chosen as the most specific and appropriate classification. While **CWE-285** (Improper Authorization) is a parent class, **CWE-863** provides more granularity.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately reflects the vulnerability, where an authorization mechanism is present but flawed. This is more precise than simply stating a general access control issue (**CWE-284**) or a missing authorization (**CWE-862**).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This CWE was considered but not selected as it doesn't directly address the authorization issue.*\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This CWE was considered but not selected as it doesn't directly relate to authorization issues.*\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was considered but not selected as it's more about information exposure through observable discrepancies.*\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
