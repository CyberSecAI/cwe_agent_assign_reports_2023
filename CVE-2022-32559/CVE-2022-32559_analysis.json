The secondary CWE, CWE-200, describes the general impact of exposing sensitive information. CWE-306 is a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), providing a more specific classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **missing authentication** (CWE-306) for the metrics endpoint, leading directly to the **exposure of sensitive information** (metrics) to unauthorized actors.\n  - Root Cause: CWE-306\n  - Impact: Exposure of Sensitive Information\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which stems from the **lack of proper authentication** for the metrics endpoint. The provided evidence clearly indicates that random HTTP requests can access these endpoints, leading to the **leak of sensitive metrics**.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-306 as the primary CWE is based on the following evidence:\n*   Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: N/A, no specific phrases led to this conclusion.\n*   CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"The system **does not implement proper authentication** or authorization for its metrics endpoints.\"\n\nThe graph relationships and mapping guidance support this selection, as CWE-306 is a Base level CWE under the Improper Authentication Class.
