The **root cause** is the **failure to sanitize user-provided input**, which allows attackers to inject arbitrary shell commands. This leads to Remote Command Execution (RCE).\n\nThe selection of CWE-78 is strongly supported by the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which states, \"The backend program fails to sanitize or validate user-provided input, directly concatenating the input with a system command, and subsequently executes the unsanitized string as a shell command.\"\n\nCWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')) is the most appropriate because the vulnerability specifically involves the execution of OS commands via injected input. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" also highlights \"Remote Command Execution\" as the impact, further solidifying this choice.\n\nCWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')) was considered but deemed less specific. While CWE-77 covers command injection in general, CWE-78 is a more precise fit because it explicitly addresses OS command injection, aligning perfectly with the evidence that malicious OS commands can be executed. The mapping guidance for CWE-77 even suggests using CWE-78 when OS command injection is the case.\n\nThe selection is at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-78 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred for root cause analysis.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product violates well-established principles for secure design.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
