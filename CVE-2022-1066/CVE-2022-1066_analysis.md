# Analysis for CVE-2022-1066

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-862, which is a Class-level CWE. While it might be ideal to find a more specific Base or Variant CWE, the available information strongly points to a **missing authorization** issue as the root cause. CWE-522 is a closely related Class-level CWE related to **insufficient protection of credentials**, and is included as the secondary CWE. These are related because the **missing authorization** leads to **unauthenticated access** to those **insufficiently protected credentials**. There does not appear to be evidence for more specific CWEs.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **missing authorization (CWE-862)**. Because there is **missing authorization**, an attacker gains access to hashed user credentials which are therefore **insufficiently protected (CWE-522)**. This can then lead to account manipulation and exposure of sensitive information.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis indicates that the primary weakness is the **missing authorization**, which allows unauthenticated access to sensitive information. This is directly supported by the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" which states: **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions that an **unauthenticated attacker** can access hashed user credentials.

The selection of CWE-862 is further supported by the "CWE for similar CVE Descriptions" section, which lists CWE-862 as the primary CWE match and the top CWE based on count. The retriever results also list CWE-862 as a possible candidate.

CWE-522 is included because the attacker is able to access the hashed credentials and the credentials are thus **insufficiently protected**.

Other CWEs were considered but ultimately not chosen:

*   CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function): While related, authentication is about identifying a user, while authorization is about what that user can do. The provided text states that the root cause is **missing authorization**, therefore CWE-862 is a better fit.
*   CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password): This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is not related to the use of hard-coded passwords. The description mentions access to hashed user credentials, not hard-coded credentials.
*   CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort): This CWE could be relevant if the password hashing algorithm used was weak. However, the provided information does not provide enough evidence, only that an attacker can access the hashed credentials.
*   CWE-538 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory): This CWE is not as precise as the **missing authorization** and **insufficient protection** of the credentials themselves.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.
