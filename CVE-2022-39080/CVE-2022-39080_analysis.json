The CWE-862 *Missing Authorization* [Class] is a child of CWE-285 *Improper Authorization* [Class] and CWE-284 *Improper Access Control* [Class]. The relationship indicates that if authorization is missing, it leads to improper access control.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing permission check** (CWE-862), which leads to elevation of privilege in the contacts service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states \"**missing permission check**\" as the root cause. This aligns directly with CWE-862 *Missing Authorization*, which describes a scenario where the product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. The impact of this **missing permission check** is elevation of privilege.\n\nThe primary CWE match from similar CVE descriptions is CWE-862, which further supports this selection. The retriever results also list CWE-862 as the top combined result.\n\nBased on the evidence and the relationship analysis, CWE-862 is the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability.\n\nThe retriever results listed several other CWEs. Here's why they were not selected:\n\n*   CWE-927 *Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication*: This is specific to Android applications and implicit intents, which is not mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n*   CWE-732 *Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource*: The vulnerability description does not explicitly mention incorrect permission assignments, but the description mentions a **missing permission check**, which is different than an incorrect one.\n*   CWE-1021 *Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames*: This relates to clickjacking vulnerabilities, which is not relevant to the given vulnerability.\n*   CWE-367 *Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition*: This involves a race condition between checking the state of a resource and using it, which is not evident in the provided description.\n*   CWE-863 *Incorrect Authorization*: This is a similar Class-level CWE, but it's more fitting when the authorization is incorrectly done instead of missing entirely.\n*   CWE-20 *Improper Input Validation*: This is too generic and doesn't specifically address the **missing permission check**.\n*   CWE-667 *Improper Locking*: This relates to locking mechanisms, which are not relevant to the vulnerability description.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
