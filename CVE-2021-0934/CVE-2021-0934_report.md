## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-770 | Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-770, which is a child of CWE-400. This indicates a hierarchical relationship where CWE-770 is a more specific instance of uncontrolled resource consumption. The choice of CWE-770 is based on the specific weakness of allocating resources without limits or throttling. CWE-400 is a broader class that encompasses various resource consumption issues, making CWE-770 a more precise fit for the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain involves:
1.  **Root Cause:** **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling** (CWE-770)
2.  **Impact:** Denial of Service due to **resource exhaustion**.

The initial flaw is the **improper** allocation of resources, which directly leads to the **resource exhaustion** and subsequent denial of service.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment, supported by the provided evidence, points to **resource exhaustion** as the primary impact. The key phrase "resource exhaustion" in the vulnerability description directly aligns with this.

The analysis of the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the root cause as insufficient input validation leading to a bypassable validation issue in `AccountManagerService`. This allows an attacker to cause **resource exhaustion** by providing excessively long `accountName` or `typeName` values.

The Retriever Results list CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) as the top match, but it is a Class-level CWE and is discouraged. CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is also listed and is a Base-level CWE, making it a better fit.

The relationship analysis shows that CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400, meaning it is a more specific type of **uncontrolled resource consumption**. Given the specific nature of the vulnerability involving the allocation of resources without proper limits, CWE-770 is chosen as the primary CWE.

The decision is based on the evidence of **resource exhaustion** due to **improper** allocation of resources without limits, as stated in the vulnerability description. The choice of CWE-770 is further justified by its Base level of abstraction and the MITRE mapping guidance, which allows its usage.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected:* This CWE focuses on the improper release of resources, which isn't the primary issue here. The main problem is the lack of limits during allocation.

## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected:* While related, this CWE is too general. The vulnerability is specifically about resource allocation limits, not just any unusual condition.

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* Irrelevant to the described vulnerability.

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected:* Locking issues are not the core problem. The vulnerability is about allocating too many resources without limits, not concurrency issues.

## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.

*Not Selected:* This is a high-level CWE and less specific than CWE-770.

## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* This CWE is not relevant to the vulnerability description.

## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.

*Not Selected:* Too general; CWE-770 is more specific.

## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is "asymmetric."

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected:* While asymmetric resource consumption could be a factor, the primary issue is the lack of allocation limits.

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* Not relevant to the described vulnerability.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287
