It has a parent CWE of CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure). The secondary CWE, CWE-757 is a Base level CWE and a ChildOf CWE-693. Choosing CWE-327 as primary captures the general use of a risky algorithm. If the negotiation aspect was clearer, I might have chosen CWE-757 as primary since it is more specific.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe757[\"CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    \n    cwe327 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe757 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe327 primary\n    class cwe757 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm**. This leads to the ability of a low-privileged remote attacker to **decrypt the encrypted data**.\n  - The root cause is the **Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm**.\n  - The impact is the ability to decrypt the encrypted data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed towards CWE-327, \"Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm,\" which aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description's key phrase: \"**rootcause:** **Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm**\". The retriever results also listed CWE-327 as the top candidate.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"**Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm** in SICK RFU61x firmware version <v2.25 allows a low-privileged remote attacker to decrypt the encrypted data if the user requested weak cipher suites to be used for encryption via the SSH interface.\"\n\nCWE-327 is a Class-level CWE, and the mapping guidance suggests examining its children for a better fit. One potential child is CWE-1240, \"Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation,\" which is a Base-level CWE. However, CWE-327 is more appropriate because it directly addresses the use of a broken or risky algorithm, while CWE-1240 is more about the implementation of the primitive.\n\nCWE-757, \"Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')\" was also considered as the vulnerability description mentions \"if the user requested weak cipher suites to be used for encryption via the SSH interface.\" This suggests that the algorithm downgrade could be a factor. However, the primary weakness is the existence and use of the broken or risky cryptographic algorithm in the first place. Therefore, CWE-327 is chosen as the primary, with CWE-757 as a possible contributing factor if the root cause was the selection of weak ciphers.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence that the **rootcause** is the **Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm**, making CWE-327 the most appropriate primary classification. CWE-327 is at the optimal level of specificity as it captures the core weakness described in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) in a security context, but the PRNG's algorithm is not cryptographically strong.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-335: Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) but does not correctly manage seeds.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
