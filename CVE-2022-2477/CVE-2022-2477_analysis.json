CWE-416 is a child of CWE-825 **(Expired Pointer Dereference)** and CWE-672 **(Operation on Resource after Expiration)**. The description clearly states a **use-after-free** condition, making this the most direct and appropriate mapping. CWE-787 **(Out-of-bounds Write)** is considered as a possible secondary issue, as **heap corruption** is mentioned in the vulnerability description, but the **use-after-free** is the root cause that leads to the **heap corruption**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource after Expiration\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe416 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **use-after-free** condition (CWE-416), which can lead to **heap corruption**, and eventually remote code execution. The **use-after-free** is the root cause.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identified CWE-416 as the primary weakness based on the explicit mention of \"use after free\" in the vulnerability description. The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** section also confirms that the root cause of the vulnerability is a **use-after-free**. The vulnerability description also states there is **heap corruption** from the **use-after-free** which could be classified as CWE-787.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description:\n- \"Use after free in Guest View in Google Chrome prior to 103.0.5060.134 allowed an attacker who convinced a user to install a malicious extension to potentially exploit **heap corruption** via a crafted HTML page.\"\n- **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**: **rootcause:** **use after free**; **weakness:** **heap corruption**\n- **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**: \"Root cause of vulnerability\": \"Use after free\"\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-416 as the top candidate. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-416 can precede CWE-787.\n\nThe selection of CWE-416 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the **use-after-free** condition.\n\nCWE-366 **(Race Condition within a Thread)**, CWE-843 **(Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion'))**, CWE-122 **(Heap-based Buffer Overflow)**, CWE-362 **(Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'))**, CWE-451 **(User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information)**, CWE-364 **(Signal Handler Race Condition)**, CWE-415 **(Double Free)**, CWE-404 **(Improper Resource Shutdown or Release)**, and CWE-911 **(Improper Update of Reference Count)** were considered but not used because the vulnerability description and supporting evidence point most directly to a **use-after-free** condition. While **heap corruption** is mentioned, it appears to be a consequence of the primary **use-after-free** weakness rather than a separate, independent vulnerability.",
