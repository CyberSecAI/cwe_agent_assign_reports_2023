CWE-190 is a ChildOf CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation). CWE-125 is a ChildOf CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe682[\"CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe190 -->|CHILDOF| cwe682\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe125\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe125 secondary\n    class cwe682,cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow** (CWE-190), which then leads to an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125), and finally results in local information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that an **integer overflow** leads to an **out-of-bounds read**.\nThe \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section confirms that the **rootcause** is an **integer overflow** and the **weakness** is an **out of bounds read**.
