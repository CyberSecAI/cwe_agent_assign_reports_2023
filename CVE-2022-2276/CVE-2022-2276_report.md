# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2022-2276

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-352 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | 1.0 | Compound | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 1.0 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-352, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), which is a compound weakness requiring multiple conditions. CWE-862, Missing Authorization, is a class-level weakness that is a child of CWE-285, Improper Authorization. Choosing CWE-352 and CWE-862 captures the specific issues in the vulnerability description more accurately than a higher-level CWE.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** and **CSRF check** in the AJAX action. This leads to the ability for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary posts/pages from the blog.
- **Root Cause:** **Missing Authorization** and **Missing CSRF Protection**
- **Weakness:** Improper Access Control
- **Impact:** Arbitrary Post/Page Deletion

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified two key weaknesses: **missing authorization** and a **missing CSRF check**. The evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-352 and CWE-862.

The vulnerability description states: "The WP Edit Menu WordPress plugin before 1.5.0 does not have authorisation and CSRF in an AJAX action, which could allow unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary posts/pages from the blog."

The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section confirms this by stating: "The `wpem_remove_menu_entry` AJAX action in the WP Edit Menu plugin lacked proper authorization and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection." and "Missing Authorization: The AJAX action did not verify if the user was authorized to delete posts before processing the request. Specifically, it did not check if the user had the `administrator` capability before allowing the post deletion." and "CSRF Vulnerability: The code was vulnerable to CSRF attacks as it did not include any nonce verification."

CWE-352 is the most appropriate choice because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the lack of CSRF protection. The MITRE mapping guidance ALLOWS for the use of CWE-352.

CWE-862 is also an appropriate choice because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **missing authorization**. The MITRE mapping guidance ALLOWS-WITH-REVIEW for the use of CWE-862.

CWE-285 was considered, but DISCOURAGED by the MITRE mapping guidance since more specific CWEs are available. CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization was considered, but the vulnerability description states authorization is **missing**, not **incorrect**, making CWE-862 a better fit. CWE-425 Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') was considered, but it describes a situation where authorization is not adequately enforced on all restricted URLs, while this vulnerability explicitly involves AJAX actions without authorization, making CWE-862 a better fit.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.



## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping
