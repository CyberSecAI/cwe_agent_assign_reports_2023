CWE-862, Missing Authorization, is a class-level weakness that is a child of CWE-285, Improper Authorization. Choosing CWE-352 and CWE-862 captures the specific issues in the vulnerability description more accurately than a higher-level CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** and **CSRF check** in the AJAX action. This leads to the ability for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary posts/pages from the blog.\n- **Root Cause:** **Missing Authorization** and **Missing CSRF Protection**\n- **Weakness:** Improper Access Control\n- **Impact:** Arbitrary Post/Page Deletion\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified two key weaknesses: **missing authorization** and a **missing CSRF check**. The evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-352 and CWE-862.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"The WP Edit Menu WordPress plugin before 1.5.0 does not have authorisation and CSRF in an AJAX action, which could allow unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary posts/pages from the blog.\"\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section confirms this by stating: \"The `wpem_remove_menu_entry` AJAX action in the WP Edit Menu plugin lacked proper authorization and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection.\" and \"Missing Authorization: The AJAX action did not verify if the user was authorized to delete posts before processing the request. Specifically, it did not check if the user had the `administrator` capability before allowing the post deletion.\" and \"CSRF Vulnerability: The code was vulnerable to CSRF attacks as it did not include any nonce verification.\"\n\nCWE-352 is the most appropriate choice because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the lack of CSRF protection. The MITRE mapping guidance ALLOWS for the use of CWE-352.\n\nCWE-862 is also an appropriate choice because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **missing authorization**. The MITRE mapping guidance ALLOWS-WITH-REVIEW for the use of CWE-862.\n\nCWE-285 was considered, but DISCOURAGED by the MITRE mapping guidance since more specific CWEs are available. CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization was considered, but the vulnerability description states authorization is **missing**, not **incorrect**, making CWE-862 a better fit. CWE-425 Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') was considered, but it describes a situation where authorization is not adequately enforced on all restricted URLs, while this vulnerability explicitly involves AJAX actions without authorization, making CWE-862 a better fit.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
