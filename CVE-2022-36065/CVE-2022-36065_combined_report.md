# Analysis for CVE-2022-36065

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | 0.8 | Base | Primary CWE | Allowed |
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Secondary Candidate | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the selection was the hierarchical structure, specifically how CWE-22 is a base level weakness related to path traversal and is a more specific version of its parent class. I also considered the retriever results for CWE-24: Path Traversal: '../filedir' which is a Variant of CWE-23, and the retriever result for CWE-22, which led me to choose CWE-22 since this is a traversal issue, not just a '../filedir' traversal issue. CWE-863 is a Class level CWE that represents that authorization checks were not correctly performed, which is related to the first time register API.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control** and **insecure file upload** handling, which leads to the ability to register new accounts, upload files to arbitrary directories, and ultimately execute arbitrary code.

## Summary of Analysis
My analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and the associated key phrases, as well as the CVE reference links content summary. The most compelling evidence comes from the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" section, which highlights the **root cause** as **improper access control**, and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary which states that the vulnerability stems from **insecure file upload** handling and **insufficient security checks**.

The retriever results and the complete CWE specifications further support this assessment. CWE-22, CWE-24, CWE-863, and CWE-552 were strong candidates. I chose CWE-22 as the primary weakness because it accurately describes the path traversal aspect of the file upload vulnerability. I chose CWE-863 as a secondary weakness because it describes the improper authorization aspect of the first-time register API.

The selection of CWE-22 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory**, while being a base level CWE.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-36065

## Vulnerability Description
GrowthBook is an open-source platform for feature flagging and A/B testing. With some self-hosted configurations in versions prior to 2022-08-29, attackers can register new accounts and upload files to arbitrary directories within the container. If the attacker uploads a Python script to the right location, they can execute arbitrary code within the container. To be affected, ALL of the following must be true Self-hosted deployment (GrowthBook Cloud is unaffected) using local file uploads (as opposed to S3 or Google Cloud Storage) NODE_ENV set to a non-production value and JWT_SECRET set to an easily guessable string like `dev`. This issue is patched in commit 1a5edff8786d141161bf880c2fd9ccbe2850a264 (2022-08-29). As a workaround, set `JWT_SECRET` environment variable to a long random string. This will stop arbitrary file uploads, but the only way to stop attackers from registering accounts is by updating to the latest build.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper access control**
- **impact:** register new accounts and upload files to arbitrary directories and execute arbitrary code
- **vector:** account creation and file upload and Python script execution
- **product:** self-hosted GrowthBook
- **version:** prior to 2022-08-29

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36065:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insecure file upload handling and insufficient security checks in self-hosted GrowthBook deployments when the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is not set to "production". Specifically, security checks are disabled when the `NODE_ENV` is not production and the domain is not localhost, allowing for potential exploitation of the file upload API. Additionally, the use of the default "dev" string for `JWT_SECRET` makes the system more vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Insecure File Upload:** The file upload API endpoint lacked proper protection against directory traversal.
2.  **Conditional Security Checks:** Security checks were disabled when `NODE_ENV` was not set to "production" and the domain was not localhost.
3.  **Default JWT Secret:** The use of a default `JWT_SECRET` ("dev") made the system susceptible to unauthorized access.
4. **Unprotected first-time register API:** The first-time register API endpoint lacked sufficient security checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation could allow attackers to:

1.  **Register new accounts:** Attackers could bypass the intended access controls and create new user accounts.
2.  **Upload arbitrary files:** Attackers could upload malicious files to arbitrary directories within the container.
3.  **Execute arbitrary code:** By uploading a malicious script (e.g., a Python script) to specific locations, attackers could execute arbitrary code within the container.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Network Access:** The GrowthBook API must be exposed to the internet.
2.  **File Upload API:** Exploiting the file upload API endpoint with a crafted file path.
3.  **First-time registration API:** Exploiting the first-time register API endpoint to create new user accounts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the GrowthBook API.
2.  **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable file upload endpoint, or the vulnerable first-time register API endpoint, and how to exploit it.
3. **Specific Environment Conditions:** The self-hosted instance must meet the following conditions to be vulnerable
     * Using local file uploads (as opposed to S3 or Google Cloud Storage).
     * `NODE_ENV` set to a non-production value.
     * `JWT_SECRET` set to an easily guessable string like "dev".

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to self-hosted instances of GrowthBook, not the GrowthBook Cloud service.
*   The fix involves adding more robust protection to the file upload API, limiting the disabling of security checks to only when the domain is "localhost", and adding extra sanity checks to the first-time register API endpoint.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in commit `1a5edff` and the fix was delivered through pull request #487.
* The vulnerability has a high severity rating.
* The weakness is related to CWE-24, Improper Input Handling.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-24: Path Traversal: '../filedir'
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize "../" sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

### Extended Description


This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.


The "../" manipulation is the canonical manipulation for operating systems that use "/" as directory separators, such as UNIX- and Linux-based systems. In some cases, it is useful for bypassing protection schemes in environments for which "/" is supported but not the primary separator, such as Windows, which uses "\" but can also accept "/".


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-23

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)




## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-285
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.

### Extended Description
When a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-285
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which "permissions" are not checked, which is an "authorization" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].
**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.
- **CVE-2009-3482:** Anti-virus product sets insecure "Everyone: Full Control" permissions for files under the "Program Files" folder, allowing attackers to replace executables with Trojan horses.
- **CVE-2009-3897:** Product creates directories with 0777 permissions at installation, allowing users to gain privileges and access a socket used for authentication.




## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.

### Extended Description


Web servers, FTP servers, and similar servers may store a set of files underneath a "root" directory that is accessible to the server's users. Applications may store sensitive files underneath this root without also using access control to limit which users may request those files, if any. Alternately, an application might package multiple files or directories into an archive file (e.g., ZIP or tar), but the application might not exclude sensitive files that are underneath those directories.


In cloud technologies and containers, this weakness might present itself in the form of misconfigured storage accounts that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-668
ChildOf -> CWE-668
ChildOf -> CWE-285

**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-1835:** Data file under web root.




## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

### Extended Description


Resources such as files and directories may be inadvertently exposed through mechanisms such as insecure permissions, or when a program accidentally operates on the wrong object. For example, a program may intend that private files can only be provided to a specific user. This effectively defines a control sphere that is intended to prevent attackers from accessing these private files. If the file permissions are insecure, then parties other than the user will be able to access those files.


A separate control sphere might effectively require that the user can only access the private files, but not any other files on the system. If the program does not ensure that the user is only requesting private files, then the user might be able to access other files on the system.


In either case, the end result is that a resource has been exposed to the wrong party.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-664

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.
**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** A "control sphere" is a set of resources and behaviors that are accessible to a single actor, or a group of actors. A product's security model will typically define multiple spheres, possibly implicitly. For example, a server might define one sphere for "administrators" who can create new user accounts with subdirectories under /home/server/, and a second sphere might cover the set of users who can create or delete files within their own subdirectories. A third sphere might be "users who are authenticated to the operating system on which the product is installed." Each sphere has different sets of actors and allowable behaviors.






## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Unrestricted File Upload: Used in vulnerability databases and elsewhere, but it is insufficiently precise. The phrase could be interpreted as the lack of restrictions on the size or number of uploaded files, which is a resource consumption issue.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-669
ChildOf -> CWE-669
PeerOf -> CWE-351
PeerOf -> CWE-436
PeerOf -> CWE-430

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

This can have a chaining relationship with incomplete denylist / permissive allowlist errors when the product tries, but fails, to properly limit which types of files are allowed (CWE-183, CWE-184).


This can also overlap multiple interpretation errors for intermediaries, e.g. anti-virus products that do not remove or quarantine attachments with certain file extensions that can be processed by client systems.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-5227:** PHP-based FAQ management app does not check the MIME type for uploaded images
- **CVE-2001-0901:** Web-based mail product stores ".shtml" attachments that could contain SSI
- **CVE-2002-1841:** PHP upload does not restrict file types




## CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a cross-domain policy file that includes domains that should not be trusted.

### Extended Description


A cross-domain policy file ("crossdomain.xml" in Flash and "clientaccesspolicy.xml" in Silverlight) defines a list of domains from which a server is allowed to make cross-domain requests. When making a cross-domain request, the Flash or Silverlight client will first look for the policy file on the target server. If it is found, and the domain hosting the application is explicitly allowed to make requests, the request is made.


Therefore, if a cross-domain policy file includes domains that should not be trusted, such as when using wildcards, then the application could be attacked by these untrusted domains.


An overly permissive policy file allows many of the same attacks seen in Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79). Once the user has executed a malicious Flash or Silverlight application, they are vulnerable to a variety of attacks. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site.


In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2012-2292:** Product has a Silverlight cross-domain policy that does not restrict access to another application, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy.
- **CVE-2014-2049:** The default Flash Cross Domain policies in a product allows remote attackers to access user files.
- **CVE-2007-6243:** Chain: Adobe Flash Player does not sufficiently restrict the interpretation and usage of cross-domain policy files, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-domain and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.




## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

### Extended Description

### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Sensitive information could include data that is sensitive in and of itself (such as credentials or private messages), or otherwise useful in the further exploitation of the system (such as internal file system structure).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses




## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
insecure temporary file: Some people use the phrase "insecure temporary file" when referring to a link following weakness, but other weaknesses can produce insecure temporary files without any symlink involvement at all.
Zip Slip: "Zip slip" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282]. It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).

### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** 

Link following vulnerabilities are Multi-factor Vulnerabilities (MFV). They are the combination of multiple elements: file or directory permissions, filename predictability, race conditions, and in some cases, a design limitation in which there is no mechanism for performing atomic file creation operations.


Some potential factors are race conditions, permissions, and predictability.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-1999-1386:** Some versions of Perl follow symbolic links when running with the -e option, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.
- **CVE-2000-1178:** Text editor follows symbolic links when creating a rescue copy during an abnormal exit, which allows local users to overwrite the files of other users.
- **CVE-2004-0217:** Antivirus update allows local users to create or append to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a logfile.
