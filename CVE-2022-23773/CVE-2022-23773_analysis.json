CWE-863 is a class-level weakness that is a parent of CWE-639, indicating a broader category of authorization issues. The relationships show that misinterpretation of input can lead to authorization bypass scenarios. Selecting CWE-115 as the primary CWE offers a more precise characterization of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe115[\"CWE-115: Misinterpretation of Input\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe115 -->|CANLEADTO| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe115 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **misinterpretation of branch names** (CWE-115). This leads to **incorrect access control** (CWE-863), potentially allowing unauthorized actions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered multiple CWEs, with CWE-115, CWE-863, and CWE-639 being the most relevant. The decision to prioritize CWE-115 as the primary CWE is based on the root cause analysis, which highlights the **misinterpretation of branch names** as the fundamental flaw. The evidence from the CVE description supports this: \"The go command incorrectly interprets branches with semantic-version names as releases.\" This **misinterpretation** then leads to the possibility of bypassing access controls, aligning with CWE-863.\n\nThe selection of CWE-115 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **misinterpretation of input**. While CWE-863 and CWE-639 represent the potential impact (authorization bypass), they are secondary to the initial error in input handling.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
