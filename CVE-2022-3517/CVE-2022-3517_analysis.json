While the vulnerability does lead to denial of service (resource consumption), the root cause is the inefficient regular expression. Therefore, the more specific CWE-1333 was chosen.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe407 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is:\n1.  Use of an **inefficient regular expression** (CWE-1333) in the `braceExpand` function.\n2.  Attacker provides a crafted input.\n3.  The regular expression engine performs excessive backtracking.\n4.  Excessive CPU consumption, leading to Denial of Service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the denial of service. The vulnerability description clearly states that the **weakness** is a \"**regular expression denial of service**\" caused by an inefficient regular expression in the `braceExpand` function of the `minimatch` package. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating \"The regular expression used in `braceExpand` function, specifically `/\\{.*\\}/`, is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS).\"\n\nThe Retriever Results strongly suggested CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity) as the top candidate, with a score of 1.0. The CWE description directly matches the vulnerability: \"The product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.\" The mapping guidance for CWE-1333 indicates that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.\n\nCWE-407 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption), a parent of CWE-1333, was considered but deemed less specific. The vulnerability's root cause isn't simply resource consumption but the specific type of resource consumption caused by an inefficient regex.\n\nTherefore, CWE-1333 is the most accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability's root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n##
