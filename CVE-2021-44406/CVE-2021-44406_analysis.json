Additionally, CWE-400 **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** can be a consequence of **improper input validation**. The evidence supports mapping the root cause as CWE-20 and the impact as CWE-400.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe400 -->|CanFollow| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper input validation** (CWE-20) of the `param` JSON element in the `GetAutoFocus` API. Because the `param` is not validated to be a JSON object, and the application uses the subscription operator to access this element, a non-object type leads to an assertion failure. This failure causes the `cgiserver.cgi` process to terminate, leading to a device reboot, and ultimately a **denial of service** (CWE-400).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the description indicates a **denial of service**, but the CVE Reference Links Content Summary reveals the root cause: **improper input validation**. The `cgiserver.cgi` binary incorrectly assumes that the `param` JSON element will always be a JSON object.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-20 **Improper Input Validation** because the application does not properly validate the type of the `param` JSON element before accessing it. The impact of this **improper input validation** is a **denial of service**, making CWE-400 **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** a secondary CWE to consider.\n\nCWE-20 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly reflects the root cause described in the CVE details where the application does not properly validate the type of the JSON parameter `param`.\n\nRelevant CWE

assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may\n         become a very small or negative number.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity",
