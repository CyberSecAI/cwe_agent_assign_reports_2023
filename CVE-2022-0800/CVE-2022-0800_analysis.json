CWE-122, Heap-based Buffer Overflow, is a child of CWE-787, making it a more specific variant. CWE-119, Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, is a parent of both CWE-787 and CWE-122, representing a more general class of weakness. The relationship analysis indicates that CWE-787 is the most appropriate base CWE, while CWE-122 provides additional specificity about the location of the buffer.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe122 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a crafted HTML page that triggers a **heap buffer overflow** in the Cast UI. This leads to heap corruption, potentially allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points to a **buffer overflow** vulnerability. The key phrase \"heap **buffer overflow**\" and the summary \"Heap **buffer overflow** in Cast UI\" provide direct evidence.\n\nThe retriever results also suggest CWE-119, CWE-190, CWE-120, CWE-416, and CWE-122. However, given the explicit mention of \"heap **buffer overflow**\", the most specific and relevant CWE is CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), with CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) as a more specific variant.\n\nCWE-119 is too general, as it encompasses all types of buffer overflows. CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) is not directly supported by the evidence, although integer overflows can sometimes lead to buffer overflows. CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input) is a specific type of buffer overflow, but the description doesn't specify that the overflow was caused by copying without checking the size. CWE-416 (Use After Free) is not directly indicated in the description.\n\nTherefore, CWE-787 is the most appropriate primary CWE, capturing the essence of the **out-of-bounds write**. CWE-122 is a good secondary candidate as it identifies the location of the overflow.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially
