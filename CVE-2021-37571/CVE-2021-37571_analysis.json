The relationship influenced the decision to include CWE-119 as a secondary consideration, though the evidence strongly supports the more specific CWE-787.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain involves a **mishandling of IEEE 1905 protocols** leading to an **out-of-bounds write**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary assessment is based on the explicit **weakness** mentioned in the vulnerability description and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\". The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section highlights the \"**Out-of-bounds write**\" which aligns directly with CWE-787. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" specifically states: \"The vulnerability stems from an \"out-of-bounds write\" error within the 1905 daemon. This occurs because of an incorrect bounds check within the software\" and \"CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write: The software writes data past the allocated buffer due to the flawed bounds check, leading to memory corruption.\"\nThis direct evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-787 as the primary CWE.\n\nCWE-119 was considered because CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119. However, CWE-119 is a more general class of weakness, and the provided evidence specifically points to an out-of-bounds write, making CWE-787 the more appropriate and specific choice. The MITRE mapping guidance discourages using CWE-119 when a more specific CWE is available.\n\nOther CWEs like CWE-125 (**Out-of-bounds Read**) and CWE-20 (**Improper Input Validation**) were considered based on retriever results but were not selected because the evidence explicitly indicates a write operation rather than a read, and the root cause is identified as a mishandling of protocols that results in writing outside buffer boundaries. The level of specificity of CWE-787 accurately reflects the vulnerability details provided.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
