This hierarchical relationship indicates that CWE-113 is a more specific case of **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences** than CWE-93. CWE-113 is also a child of CWE-20 (**Improper Input Validation**) and CWE-436 (**Interpretation Conflict**). The `CanPrecede` relationship from CWE-113 to CWE-79 suggests a potential path to Cross-Site Scripting.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe436[\"CWE-436: Interpretation Conflict\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe93\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe436\n    cwe113 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe113 primary\n    class cwe93,cwe20,cwe436,cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences** in the `data` parameter (CWE-113), which leads to HTTP response splitting. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers, potentially leading to XSS, cookie injection, CORS header manipulation, CSP bypass, or cache poisoning.\n  - Root Cause: CWE-113 (**Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')**)\n  - Impact: HTTP Response Splitting, potentially leading to XSS or other header-based attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, supported by the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** indicating \"**weakness: HTTP response splitting**,\" and the **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** detailing the **root cause** as a failure to properly sanitize CR and LF characters, aligns well with CWE-113. The Retriever Results also strongly suggest CWE-113 as the primary candidate, with a score of 1.0 based on alternate terms.\n\nThe vulnerability description and the summary of the CVE reference link content make it clear that the **lack of sanitization of CRLF characters** in the `data` parameter allows for **HTTP response splitting**. The description explicitly mentions the ability to inject arbitrary HTTP headers. This direct evidence supports the selection of CWE-113, **Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')**, as the primary CWE.\n\nCWE-93, **Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')**, was also considered, as it is a parent of CWE-113. While CWE-93 is a valid classification, CWE-113 is more specific to the context of HTTP headers, making it a more accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-79, **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**, was listed as the primary CWE match based on similar CVE descriptions, but it is not as directly relevant as CWE-113. The researcher attempted to chain the HTTP Response Splitting with an XSS attack but was unsuccessful. This makes CWE-79 a potential secondary impact, but not the primary weakness.\n\nThe selection of CWE-113 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it is a Variant CWE that accurately captures the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The confidence in this assessment is high (0.9), given the clear evidence and the strong alignment with the CWE description.",
