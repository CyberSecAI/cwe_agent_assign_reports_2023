While it is recommended to use a more specific Base or Variant level CWE, the evidence is directly related to the description of CWE-862. It is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). CWE-280 (Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges) was considered as a closely related alternative, representing the scenario where the service doesn't properly handle cases where permissions are lacking.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe280[\"CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284,cwe280 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission check** (CWE-862), which directly leads to a local denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-862 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of a **\"missing permission check\"** in the vulnerability description. The retriever results also listed CWE-862 as the top candidate. The relationship analysis confirmed that it is a valid classification, and while a more specific CWE would be ideal, CWE-862 accurately captures the essence of the vulnerability.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"In Gallery service, there is a **missing permission check**. This could lead to local denial of service in Gallery service with no additional execution privileges needed.\"\n\nCWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity given the available information. While there might be a more specific variant, the description doesn't provide enough details to pinpoint it.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used:** While this CWE is closely related, the vulnerability description specifically mentions a **missing permission check**, which aligns more directly with CWE-862. If the description had focused on the service's *handling* of insufficient permissions, CWE-280 would have been a better fit.\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information\n- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.\n- **CVE-2009-3597:** Web application stores database file under the web root with insufficient access control (CWE-219), allowing direct request.",
