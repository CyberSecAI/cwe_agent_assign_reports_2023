It's a child of the Pillar CWE-284 Improper Access Control, but is more specific. While CWE-285 is discouraged, the vulnerability description focuses on the *incorrect* application of authorization, making it more fitting than simply a general lack of access control. CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization, a child of CWE-284 and a more specific form of authorization failure, was also considered but ultimately deemed slightly less appropriate as the description doesn't explicitly state that an authorization *check* was performed *incorrectly*, merely that access controls were improper.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access controls**, leading to information being accessible to unauthorized authenticated users.\n\nRoot Cause: **Improper Access Controls**\nImpact: Access to information restricted to users with elevated privileges\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the provided description, emphasizing the **rootcause** \"improper access controls\". The retriever results suggested CWE-284, CWE-269, CWE-522, CWE-732, CWE-327 and others. However, deeper analysis of the CWE specifications and relationships, especially the mapping guidance, influenced the final selection.\n\nThe decision to use CWE-285 was primarily driven by the vulnerability description highlighting **improper access controls**, and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirming it. The description explicitly states \"IBM InfoSphere Information Server 11.7 could allow an authenticated user to access information restricted to users with elevated privileges due to **improper access controls**.\"\n\nWhile CWE-285 is discouraged due to being high-level, it accurately reflects that authorization checks are either missing or implemented incorrectly. A more specific CWE, such as CWE-863, could be considered, but the description doesn't give sufficient detail to confirm that an authorization *check* was performed *incorrectly*, as opposed to simply being absent or flawed in its overall design. Therefore, CWE-285 is the most appropriate starting point. CWE-284 is too high-level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
