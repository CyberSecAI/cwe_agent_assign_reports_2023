Since CWE-327 is a Class, I considered whether a more specific Base or Variant was more appropriate. However, given the evidence available, a Class level is appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    \n    cwe327 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe327 primary\n    class cwe693 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms** (CWE-327). This leads to the possibility for an attacker to decrypt highly sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-327 as the primary candidate, supported by the vulnerability description explicitly mentioning the **use of weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms**. The retriever results also listed CWE-327 as the top candidate.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"IBM CICS TX 11.7 uses **weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms** that could allow an attacker to decrypt highly sensitive information.\" This aligns directly with the description of CWE-327: \"The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.\"\n\nThe confidence in this mapping is high (1) because of the direct match between the vulnerability description and the CWE definition. CWE-327 is at the Class level of abstraction, which is appropriate given the information provided. While more specific CWEs may exist, the available evidence does not support a more granular classification.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions is not set, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
