Potentially, this is preceded by an integer overflow when calculating the size to copy.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified a **buffer overflow** vulnerability in Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoC devices due to physical modification of an SD boot image. The attacker can modify the boot header so that a secure image appears to be unencrypted and modify the full range of register initialization values. The most relevant CWE is CWE-120.\n\nThe vulnerability description mentions \"buffer overflow\" directly, and the attack involves modifying the SD card's boot header to cause the overflow in ROM by manipulating registers controlling transfer type and size.\n\nThe evidence comes from the vulnerability description: \"physical modification of an SD boot image allows for a **buffer overflow** attack in the ROM\" and \"These registers could be modified a way that causes a **buffer overflow** in the ROM.\"\n\nCWE-120 is appropriate because the vulnerability involves a buffer copy operation without checking the size of the input, leading to a classic buffer overflow.\n\nCWE-119 is too general. The mapping guidance says \"CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.\"\n\nCWE-190 is a possibility since it can precede CWE-119. If an integer overflow occurs during the calculation of the transfer size, this could lead to a smaller buffer than expected being allocated, exacerbating the buffer overflow.\n\nThe selection of CWE-120 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **buffer overflow** due to the **lack of input size checking** during the buffer copy operation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-680: Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation to determine how much memory to allocate, but an integer overflow can occur that causes less memory to be allocated than expected, leading to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a named chain, which combines multiple weaknesses.\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
