The description explicitly mentions \"**weak cryptographic algorithms**,\" which aligns well with CWE-327 \"Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating the root cause as \"The provided UC Deploy Container images contain non-unique HTTPS certificates and a database encryption key.\" and weaknesses as \"Use of hard-coded or non-unique cryptographic keys and certificates\". This indicates a potential for CWE-1394 \"Use of Default Cryptographic Key\".\n\nThe final selection prioritizes CWE-327 as the primary weakness because the description specifically mentions the use of weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms. CWE-1394 is considered as a secondary candidate because of the use of hard-coded cryptographic key.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, with CWE-327 being a Class and CWE-1394 a Base level weakness. While more specific variants exist, the available evidence supports the chosen classifications.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
