CWE-119 is a more general class-level CWE. The vulnerability could also involve CWE-125 **(Out-of-bounds Read)** in some cases. There isn't sufficient evidence to determine if this is happening.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe125 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the user opening a manipulated Jupiter Tesselation file, leading to an **out-of-bounds write** and ultimately causing the application to crash.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the **impact** of the vulnerability which is a crash when opening a manipulated file. The vulnerability description key phrases indicate that the **vector** is a manipulated Jupiter Tesselation file. The **crashes** impact suggests a memory corruption issue, specifically an **out-of-bounds write**.\n\nThe \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section lists CWE-NVD-noinfo, CWE-20, and CWE-787. Since the description indicates the opening of a manipulated file leads to a crash, CWE-787 **(Out-of-bounds Write)** is the most appropriate.\n\nThe Retriever Results also support this, listing CWE-119, CWE-20, and CWE-787 as potential matches. While CWE-119 is a parent of CWE-787, it is discouraged because it is often misused. CWE-20 is also discouraged. CWE-787 is at the Base level of abstraction and is allowed.\n\nTherefore, the selection of CWE-787 as the primary CWE is justified by the vulnerability description and supported by the Retriever Results and CWE specifications.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
