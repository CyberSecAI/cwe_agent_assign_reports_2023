# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-256 | Plaintext Storage of a Password | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-798 | Use of Hard-coded Credentials | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-256 **Plaintext Storage of a Password**, a Base level CWE. This choice is supported by the vulnerability description indicating a **plain-text password storage** vulnerability. CWE-256 is a child of CWE-522 **Insufficiently Protected Credentials**, a Class-level CWE, indicating a hierarchical relationship. CWE-312 **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information** is another relevant Base level CWE, representing a broader category that includes password storage. CWE-798 **Use of Hard-coded Credentials** was also considered, but deemed less appropriate as the vulnerability focuses on storage rather than the use of credentials.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **plain-text password storage** (CWE-256). A local malicious user with high privileges can then use the exposed password to gain unauthorized access with the privileges of the compromised user.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the most specific CWE that accurately reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description clearly states "**plain-text password storage**", making CWE-256 the most appropriate choice. The retriever results also listed CWE-256 as the top combined result. This assessment is primarily based on the provided evidence from the "Vulnerability Description" and "CVE Reference Links Content Summary".

The graph relationships influenced the decision by providing context on how CWE-256 relates to other potential weaknesses, such as CWE-522 **Insufficiently Protected Credentials**.

The selection of CWE-256 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the **plain-text password storage** vulnerability described, and it's a Base level CWE, which is preferred. CWE-312 is a broader category that encompasses various types of sensitive information, while CWE-798 relates to hard-coded credentials, which is not the primary issue in this case.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.83
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.81
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-316: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext in memory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users. In fact, it should be noted that recoverable encrypted passwords provide no significant benefit over plaintext passwords since they are subject not only to reuse by malicious attackers but also by malicious insiders. If a system administrator can recover a password directly, or use a brute force search on the available information, the administrator can use the password on other accounts.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 6419.82
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 5905.06
