# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-0545

# Vulnerability Description

    An **integer overflow** in the processing of loaded 2D images leads to a **write-what-where** vulnerability and an **out-of-bounds read** vulnerability, allowing an attacker to leak sensitive information or achieve code execution in the context of the Blender process when a specially crafted image file is loaded. This flaw affects Blender versions prior to 2.83.19, 2.93.8 and 3.1.

    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'integer overflow'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 537.05)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...

### 2. CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound) (Score: 523.18)

The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result....
