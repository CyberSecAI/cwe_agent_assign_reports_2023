## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the application failing to properly handle password reset requests. The server's response reveals whether a given username or email exists, leading to user enumeration and information disclosure.

## Summary of Analysis
Initially, the analysis focused on identifying the most specific CWE related to the information leak. The **weakness** is that the application reveals whether a user exists or not, which constitutes sensitive information. The evidence from the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms the **root cause** is related to how Grafana handles password reset requests. Specifically, "The server's response to this request reveals whether the provided username or email exists within the system, specifically by returning a "user not found" message if the user does not exist."

CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is the primary CWE because it broadly covers the exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized actors. While CWE-200 is discouraged due to its high-level nature, in this case, it is the best fit as the vulnerability's core is the disclosure itself.

CWE-204 (Observable Response Discrepancy) is a secondary CWE because the vulnerability allows attackers to distinguish between responses based on user existence. CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information) is also a secondary CWE because the error message contains sensitive information about user existence.

The selection of CWE-200 is justified because the core issue is the exposure of sensitive information. The additional CWEs provide further specificity by highlighting the observable discrepancy and the generation of error messages. These selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity given the information available.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-39307

## Vulnerability Description
Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. When using the forget password on the login page, a POST request is made to the `/api/user/password/sent-reset-email` URL. When the username or email does not exist, a JSON response contains a user not found message. This leaks information to unauthenticated users and introduces a security risk. This issue has been patched in 9.2.4 and backported to 8.5.15. There are no known workarounds.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **information leak**
- **attacker:** unauthenticated users
- **product:** Grafana
- **version:** before 9.2.4 and 8.5.15
- **component:** forget password feature

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-39307:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Grafana handles password reset requests. When a user attempts to reset their password, a POST request is sent to `/api/user/password/sent-reset-email`. The server's response to this request reveals whether the provided username or email exists within the system, specifically by returning a "user not found" message if the user does not exist.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **User Enumeration:** The primary weakness is the ability to enumerate valid usernames/emails by observing the server's response to password reset attempts. This is a form of information disclosure.
- **Information Leakage:** The server's response leaks information to unauthenticated users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially use this vulnerability to compile a list of valid usernames/emails, which can then be used in subsequent attacks such as brute-force password attacks or targeted phishing campaigns.
- **Security Risk:** The information leakage exposes the system to potential unauthorized access or information gathering.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or access to the system.
- **Network access:** Attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable Grafana instance.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** Grafana versions prior to 9.2.4 and 8.5.15 are affected. Specifically, versions >=9.0.0 and <9.2.4, and any version before 8.5.15 are vulnerable.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 5.3 (Medium), and a CVSS v4 score of 7.3 (High).
- **Remediation:** The vulnerability is fixed in Grafana versions 9.2.4 and 8.5.15. Users should upgrade to these versions or later.
- **NetApp Products:** NetApp E-Series Performance Analyzer is listed as an affected product.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.

### Extended Description


There are many different kinds of mistakes that introduce information exposures. The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker. Some kinds of sensitive information include:


  - private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details

  - system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages

  - business secrets and intellectual property

  - network status and configuration

  - the product's own code or internal state

  - metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers

  - indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider

Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected. These parties include:

  - the product's own users

  - people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users

  - the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates

  - the developer

Information exposures can occur in different ways:

  - the code  **explicitly inserts**  sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been "scrubbed" or "sanitized"

  - a different weakness or mistake  **indirectly inserts**  the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.

  - the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are  **unintentionally made accessible**  to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.

It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an "information exposure," but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read. CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store, transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

### Alternative Terms
Information Disclosure: This term is frequently used in vulnerability advisories to describe a consequence or technical impact, for any vulnerability that has a loss of confidentiality. Often, CWE-200 can be misused to represent the loss of confidentiality, even when the mistake - i.e., the weakness - is not directly related to the mishandling of the information itself, such as an out-of-bounds read that accesses sensitive memory contents; here, the out-of-bounds read is the primary weakness, not the disclosure of the memory. In addition, this phrase is also used frequently in policies and legal documents, but it does not refer to any disclosure of security-relevant information.
Information Leak: This is a frequently used term, however the "leak" term has multiple uses within security. In some cases it deals with the accidental exposure of information from a different weakness, but in other cases (such as "memory leak"), this deals with improper tracking of resources, which can lead to exhaustion. As a result, CWE is actively avoiding usage of the "leak" term.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].
**Comments:** If an error or mistake causes information to be disclosed, then use the CWE ID for that error. Consider starting with improper authorization (CWE-285), insecure permissions (CWE-732), improper authentication (CWE-287), etc. Also consider children such as Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data (CWE-201), Observable Discrepancy (CWE-203), Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory (CWE-538), or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As a result of mapping analysis in the 2020 Top 25 and more recent versions, this weakness is under review, since it is frequently misused in mapping to cover many problems that lead to loss of confidentiality. See Mapping Notes, Extended Description, and Alternate Terms.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-31162:** Rust library leaks Oauth client details in application debug logs
- **CVE-2021-25476:** Digital Rights Management (DRM) capability for mobile platform leaks pointer information, simplifying ASLR bypass
- **CVE-2001-1483:** Enumeration of valid usernames based on inconsistent responses




## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.

### Extended Description


The sensitive information may be valuable information on its own (such as a password), or it may be useful for launching other, more serious attacks. The error message may be created in different ways:


  - self-generated: the source code explicitly constructs the error message and delivers it

  - externally-generated: the external environment, such as a language interpreter, handles the error and constructs its own message, whose contents are not under direct control by the programmer

An attacker may use the contents of error messages to help launch another, more focused attack. For example, an attempt to exploit a path traversal weakness (CWE-22) might yield the full pathname of the installed application. In turn, this could be used to select the proper number of ".." sequences to navigate to the targeted file. An attack using SQL injection (CWE-89) might not initially succeed, but an error message could reveal the malformed query, which would expose query logic and possibly even passwords or other sensitive information used within the query.

### Alternative Terms

- **CVE-2008-4638:** Composite: application running with high privileges (CWE-250) allows user to specify a restricted file to process, which generates a parsing error that leaks the contents of the file (CWE-209).




## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Sensitive information could include data that is sensitive in and of itself (such as credentials or private messages), or otherwise useful in the further exploitation of the system (such as internal file system structure).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses




## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

### Extended Description


Retrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.


For example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.


One manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.


### Alternative Terms
Insecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The "Insecure Direct Object Reference" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.
Broken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.
Horizontal Authorization: "Horizontal Authorization" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.
