CWE-200 has children like CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information) and CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data), which are more specific Base-level CWEs. CWE-204 (Observable Response Discrepancy) is also a child of CWE-203 and is related to information exposure through different responses.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe204[\"CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe204 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe209 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe204,cwe209 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the application failing to properly handle password reset requests. The server's response reveals whether a given username or email exists, leading to user enumeration and information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the analysis focused on identifying the most specific CWE related to the information leak. The **weakness** is that the application reveals whether a user exists or not, which constitutes sensitive information. The evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms the **root cause** is related to how Grafana handles password reset requests. Specifically, \"The server's response to this request reveals whether the provided username or email exists within the system, specifically by returning a \"user not found\" message if the user does not exist.\"\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is the primary CWE because it broadly covers the exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized actors. While CWE-200 is discouraged due to its high-level nature, in this case, it is the best fit as the vulnerability's core is the disclosure itself.\n\nCWE-204 (Observable Response Discrepancy) is a secondary CWE because the vulnerability allows attackers to distinguish between responses based on user existence. CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information) is also a secondary CWE because the error message contains sensitive information about user existence.\n\nThe selection of CWE-200 is justified because the core issue is the exposure of sensitive information. The additional CWEs provide further specificity by highlighting the observable discrepancy and the generation of error messages. These selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity given the information available.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
