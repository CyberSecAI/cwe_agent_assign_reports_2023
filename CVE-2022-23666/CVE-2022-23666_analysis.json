The primary CWE match from similar CVE descriptions is CWE-78, which aligns directly with the vulnerability's root cause.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**command injection** vulnerability\". The phrase \"**command injection**\" is the key indicator.\n\nCWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command) is the most specific and appropriate choice. It is a base-level CWE, which is preferred, and it directly addresses the **command injection** vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-78 is based on the explicit mention of \"**command injection**\" in the vulnerability description and the alignment of CWE-78's description with the vulnerability's root cause. The relationship analysis and mapping guidance further support this selection.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 5.03\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-184\n- CANALSOBE -> CWE-88\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-77\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-77\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-74",
