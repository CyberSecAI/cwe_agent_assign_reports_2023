Since the vulnerability description explicitly states \"**missing permission check**\", CWE-862 is a more precise fit than its parent. CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) is a peer that could also apply given the information disclosure impact, but it's a less direct match for the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a **missing permission check**, leading directly to local information disclosure. The root cause is the **missing permission check** (CWE-862). The impact is local information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which clearly indicates a **missing permission check**. The primary evidence is the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section, specifically:\n\n*   **rootcause:** **missing permission check**\n*   **impact:** local information disclosure\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-862 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is selected because it directly reflects the **missing permission check** root cause. Other CWEs like CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) were considered but deemed less accurate as they imply an authorization check exists but is flawed, while the description indicates a complete absence of such a check. CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) was considered because of the information disclosure, but this is the impact of the missing authorization, not the root cause. CWE-862 is at the appropriate level of specificity (Class), as there isn't enough information to map to a more specific Base or Variant.\n\n**CWE Considerations:**\n\n*   **CWE-862 (Missing Authorization):** This is the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly states a **missing permission check**. This aligns with the definition of CWE-862.\n*   **CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere):** This is a secondary candidate because the vulnerability leads to local information disclosure, which aligns with the impact of CWE-668.\n\n**CWEs Not Used and Why:**\n\n*   CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization): Not used because the description states **missing permission check**, not an incorrect one.\n*   CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation): Not used as the root cause is not related to input validation but to a **missing permission check**.\n*   CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value): Not relevant as the vulnerability is not related to memory allocation.\n*   CWE-941 (Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel): Not relevant as the vulnerability is not related to communication channels.\n*   CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input): Not relevant as the vulnerability is not related to quantity validation.\n*   CWE-223 (Omission of Security-relevant Information): Not relevant as the vulnerability is not related to missing security-relevant information.",
