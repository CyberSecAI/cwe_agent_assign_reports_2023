# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction:** Compound
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

### Extended Description
When a web server is designed to receive a request from a client without any mechanism for verifying that it was intentionally sent, then it might be possible for an attacker to trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server which will be treated as an authentic request. This can be done via a URL, image load, XMLHttpRequest, etc. and can result in exposure of data or unintended code execution.

### Alternative Terms
Session Riding
Cross Site Reference Forgery
XSRF

### Relationships

ChildOf -> CWE-345
Requires -> CWE-346
Requires -> CWE-441
Requires -> CWE-642
Requires -> CWE-613

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.
**Comments:** While attack-oriented composites are supported in CWE, they have not been a focus of research. There is a chance that future research or CWE scope clarifications will change or deprecate them. Perform root-cause analysis to determine if other weaknesses allow CSRF attacks to occur, and map to those weaknesses. For example, predictable CSRF tokens might allow bypass of CSRF protection mechanisms; if this occurs, they might be better characterized as randomness/predictability weaknesses.
**Reasons:**
- Other


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

There can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.


**[Theoretical]** 

The CSRF topology is multi-channel:


  - Attacker (as outsider) to intermediary (as user). The interaction point is either an external or internal channel.

  - Intermediary (as user) to server (as victim). The activation point is an internal channel.

### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.

## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description


Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.


When access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.


### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.




## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

### Extended Description


Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:


  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.

  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.

  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.

  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.

  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.

  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.

There are three main kinds of XSS:

  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.

  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. 

  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. 

Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as "drive-by hacking."

In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.


### Alternative Terms
XSS: A common abbreviation for Cross-Site Scripting.
HTML Injection: Used as a synonym of stored (Type 2) XSS.
CSS: In the early years after initial discovery of XSS, "CSS" was a commonly-used acronym. However, this would cause confusion with "Cascading Style Sheets," so usage of this acronym has declined significantly.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

There can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.


**[Applicable Platform]** 

XSS flaws are very common in web applications, since they require a great deal of developer discipline to avoid them.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-25926:** Python Library Manager did not sufficiently neutralize a user-supplied search term, allowing reflected XSS.
- **CVE-2021-25963:** Python-based e-commerce platform did not escape returned content on error pages, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.
- **CVE-2021-1879:** Universal XSS in mobile operating system, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Denylist / Deny List: This is used by CWE and CAPEC instead of other commonly-used terms. Its counterpart is allowlist.
Blocklist / Block List: This is often used by security tools such as firewalls, email or web gateways, proxies, etc.
Blacklist / Black List: This term is frequently used, but usage has been declining as organizations have started to adopt other terms.

**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

Multiple interpretation errors can indirectly introduce inputs that should be disallowed. For example, a list of dangerous shell metacharacters might not include a metacharacter that only has meaning in one particular shell, not all of them; or a check for XSS manipulations might ignore an unusual construct that is supported by one web browser, but not others.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the "\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.
- **CVE-2008-2309:** product uses a denylist to identify potentially dangerous content, allowing attacker to bypass a warning
- **CVE-2005-2782:** PHP remote file inclusion in web application that filters "http" and "https" URLs, but not "ftp".




## CWE-284: Improper Access Control
**Abstraction:** Pillar
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

### Extended Description


Access control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:


  - Authentication (proving the identity of an actor)

  - Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and

  - Accountability (tracking of activities that were performed)

When any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.

There are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:


  - Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.

  - Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.



### Alternative Terms
Authorization: The terms "access control" and "authorization" are often used interchangeably, although many people have distinct definitions. The CWE usage of "access control" is intended as a general term for the various mechanisms that restrict which users can access which resources, and "authorization" is more narrowly defined. It is unlikely that there will be community consensus on the use of these terms.

### Relationships
None

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-284 is extremely high-level, a Pillar. Its name, "Improper Access Control," is often misused in low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287] or by active use of the OWASP Top Ten, such as "A01:2021-Broken Access Control". It is not useful for trend analysis.
**Comments:** Consider using descendants of CWE-284 that are more specific to the kind of access control involved, such as those involving authorization (Missing Authorization (CWE-862), Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863), Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource (CWE-732), etc.); authentication (Missing Authentication (CWE-306) or Weak Authentication (CWE-1390)); Incorrect User Management (CWE-286); Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints (CWE-923); etc.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
- Abstraction
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
- CWE-306: Missing Authentication
- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
- CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** 

This entry needs more work. Possible sub-categories include:


  - Trusted group includes undesired entities (partially covered by CWE-286)

  - Group can perform undesired actions

  - ACL parse error does not fail closed





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24985:** A form hosting website only checks the session authentication status for a single form, making it possible to bypass authentication when there are multiple forms
- **CVE-2022-29238:** Access-control setting in web-based document collaboration tool is not properly implemented by the code, which prevents listing hidden directories but does not prevent direct requests to files in those directories.
- **CVE-2022-23607:** Python-based HTTP library did not scope cookies to a particular domain such that "supercookies" could be sent to any domain on redirect

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2017-9615:** verbose logging stores admin credentials in a world-readable log file
- **CVE-2018-1999036:** SSH password for private key stored in build log




## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

### Extended Description


Retrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.


For example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.


One manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.


### Alternative Terms
Insecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The "Insecure Direct Object Reference" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.
Broken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.
Horizontal Authorization: "Horizontal Authorization" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.
