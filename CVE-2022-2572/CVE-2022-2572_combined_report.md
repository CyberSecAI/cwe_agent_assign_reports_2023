# Analysis for CVE-2022-2572

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-287 | Improper Authentication | 0.8 | Class | Primary CWE | Allowed-with-Review |

| CWE-1390 | Weak Authentication | 0.7 | Class | Secondary Candidate | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the decision is that CWE-287 **Improper Authentication** is a parent Class of CWE-1390 **Weak Authentication**. The vulnerability involves a failure to invalidate API keys after a user's access has been revoked through an external provider, which points to a broader authentication issue rather than a specifically weak authentication mechanism. While CWE-1390 is relevant, CWE-287 better encompasses the overall problem. CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** is a peer Class that was considered, but the core issue seems to be authentication rather than a failure in the authorization process itself. The abstraction levels were considered, and while base-level CWEs are generally preferred, the Class level seems most appropriate here because the specific mechanism of the authentication failure isn't detailed enough to warrant a base-level classification.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause**: a **failure to properly invalidate API keys** when a user's access is revoked via an external authentication provider. This leads to the **weakness**: **API keys of disabled/deleted users remaining valid**. The final impact is that an attacker can still use the old API key to access the system, bypassing the intended access revocation.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** and the resulting impact. The "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" pointed to a **weakness** where "**API key/keys of a disabled/deleted user were still valid**," even after access was revoked. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirmed the "**failure to properly invalidate API keys**" as the root cause, leading to "**Broken Access Control**."

The Retriever Results suggested CWE-1390 **Weak Authentication**, CWE-287 **Improper Authentication**, and CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** as potential candidates. After carefully reviewing the CWE specifications, CWE-287 **Improper Authentication** was selected as the primary CWE because it best represents the general failure in the authentication process. Although the API keys being valid after revocation could be seen as a form of "weak" authentication (CWE-1390), the core issue is the **improper** handling of access revocation, making CWE-287 more fitting.

CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** was considered because the problem allows unauthorized access. However, the initial problem is in authentication (verifying the user's identity), not authorization (determining what the user can do). The system **fails to properly invalidate the user's credentials (API key) upon revocation**, which is an authentication flaw.

The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-287 discourages its use, recommending children like CWE-1390. However, in this case, the overall nature of the vulnerability as a failure to properly revoke access (and thus authenticate) justifies the use of the higher-level Class.

The confidence in the mapping is high (0.8) because the evidence clearly points to a failure in the authentication process related to API key invalidation. The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it captures the general authentication failure without focusing on a specific weak mechanism or authorization flaw.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-2572

## Vulnerability Description
In affected versions of Octopus Server where access is managed by an external authentication provider, it was possible that the **API key/keys of a disabled/deleted user were still valid** after the access was revoked.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **API key/keys of a disabled/deleted user were still valid**
- **impact:** access was revoked
- **product:** Octopus Server
- **version:** affected versions

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2572:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly invalidate API keys associated with disabled or deleted users when access is revoked via an external authentication provider.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Broken Access Control:** API keys of disabled or deleted users remain active even after their access has been revoked through an external auth provider.
- The system fails to properly synchronize the user's status with the validity of their API keys.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who had their access revoked via an external authentication provider can still use their old API key to access the system and potentially perform actions within the scope of their previous permissions, even if their user account has been disabled or deleted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker must have previously held a valid user account with access to Octopus Server.
- The attacker must have obtained an API key while their account was active.
- The user's access must have been revoked through an external authentication provider.
- The attacker can then use the old API key to access the system.

### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

### Extended Description


By design, authentication protocols try to ensure that attackers must perform brute force attacks if they do not know the credentials such as a key or password. However, when these credentials are easily predictable or even fixed (as with default or hard-coded passwords and keys), then the attacker can defeat the mechanism without relying on brute force.


Credentials may be weak for different reasons, such as:


  - Hard-coded (i.e., static and unchangeable by the administrator)

  - Default (i.e., the same static value across different deployments/installations, but able to be changed by the administrator)

  - Predictable (i.e., generated in a way that produces unique credentials across deployments/installations, but can still be guessed with reasonable efficiency)

Even if a new, unique credential is intended to be generated for each product installation, if the generation is predictable, then that may also simplify guessing attacks.

### Observed Examples
- **[REF-1374]:** Chain: JavaScript-based cryptocurrency library can fall back to the insecure Math.random() function instead of reporting a failure (CWE-392), thus reducing the entropy (CWE-332) and leading to generation of non-unique cryptographic keys for Bitcoin wallets (CWE-1391)
- **CVE-2022-30270:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses default credentials for some SSH accounts
- **CVE-2022-29965:** Distributed Control System (DCS) uses a deterministic algorithm to generate utility passwords




## CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
This attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1390
ChildOf -> CWE-287

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from insufficient verification.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30319:** S-bus functionality in a home automation product performs access control using an IP allowlist, which can be bypassed by a forged IP address.
- **CVE-2009-1048:** VOIP product allows authentication bypass using 127.0.0.1 in the Host header.




## CWE-1394: Use of Default Cryptographic Key
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a default cryptographic key for potentially critical functionality.

### Extended Description
It is common practice for products to be designed to use default keys. The rationale is to simplify the manufacturing process or the system administrator's task of installation and deployment into an enterprise. However, if admins do not change the defaults, it is easier for attackers to bypass authentication quickly across multiple organizations.

- **CVE-2010-2306:** Intrusion Detection System (IDS) uses the same static, private SSL keys for multiple devices and installations, allowing decryption of SSL traffic




## CWE-262: Not Using Password Aging
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not have a mechanism in place for managing password aging.

### Extended Description


Password aging (or password rotation) is a policy that forces users to change their passwords after a defined time period passes, such as every 30 or 90 days. Without mechanisms such as aging, users might not change their passwords in a timely manner.


Note that while password aging was once considered an important security feature, it has since fallen out of favor by many, because it is not as effective against modern threats compared to other mechanisms such as slow hashes. In addition, forcing frequent changes can unintentionally encourage users to select less-secure passwords. However, password aging is still in use due to factors such as compliance requirements, e.g., Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).

## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.

### Extended Description
This weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.

### Alternative Terms
TOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to "Time Of Check To Time Of Use".
TOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** TOCTOU issues do not always involve symlinks, and not every symlink issue is a TOCTOU problem.

**[Research Gap]** Non-symlink TOCTOU issues are not reported frequently, but they are likely to occur in code that attempts to be secure.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2015-1743:** TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed
- **CVE-2003-0813:** A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.
- **CVE-2004-0594:** PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.




## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.

### Extended Description


Cryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.


It is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.


Since the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered "unsafe" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.


For a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.
