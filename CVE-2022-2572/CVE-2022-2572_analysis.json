The vulnerability involves a failure to invalidate API keys after a user's access has been revoked through an external provider, which points to a broader authentication issue rather than a specifically weak authentication mechanism. While CWE-1390 is relevant, CWE-287 better encompasses the overall problem. CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** is a peer Class that was considered, but the core issue seems to be authentication rather than a failure in the authorization process itself. The abstraction levels were considered, and while base-level CWEs are generally preferred, the Class level seems most appropriate here because the specific mechanism of the authentication failure isn't detailed enough to warrant a base-level classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe1390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe863 -->|PEEROF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe1390 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause**: a **failure to properly invalidate API keys** when a user's access is revoked via an external authentication provider. This leads to the **weakness**: **API keys of disabled/deleted users remaining valid**. The final impact is that an attacker can still use the old API key to access the system, bypassing the intended access revocation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** and the resulting impact. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" pointed to a **weakness** where \"**API key/keys of a disabled/deleted user were still valid**,\" even after access was revoked. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirmed the \"**failure to properly invalidate API keys**\" as the root cause, leading to \"**Broken Access Control**.\"\n\nThe Retriever Results suggested CWE-1390 **Weak Authentication**, CWE-287 **Improper Authentication**, and CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** as potential candidates. After carefully reviewing the CWE specifications, CWE-287 **Improper Authentication** was selected as the primary CWE because it best represents the general failure in the authentication process. Although the API keys being valid after revocation could be seen as a form of \"weak\" authentication (CWE-1390), the core issue is the **improper** handling of access revocation, making CWE-287 more fitting.\n\nCWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** was considered because the problem allows unauthorized access. However, the initial problem is in authentication (verifying the user's identity), not authorization (determining what the user can do). The system **fails to properly invalidate the user's credentials (API key) upon revocation**, which is an authentication flaw.\n\nThe MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-287 discourages its use, recommending children like CWE-1390. However, in this case, the overall nature of the vulnerability as a failure to properly revoke access (and thus authenticate) justifies the use of the higher-level Class.\n\nThe confidence in the mapping is high (0.8) because the evidence clearly points to a failure in the authentication process related to API key invalidation. The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it captures the general authentication failure without focusing on a specific weak mechanism or authorization flaw.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
