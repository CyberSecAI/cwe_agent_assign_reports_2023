This is a specific type of race condition (CWE-362) where the state of a resource changes between when it is checked and when it is used. This enables symlink following (CWE-59), because the check for a symlink happens before the directory is deleted. An attacker can replace a directory with a symlink between the check and the deletion, leading to the function following the symlink. CWE-363 is a child of CWE-367 and can precede CWE-59.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe59[\"CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\"]\n    cwe363[\"CWE-363: Race Condition Enabling Link Following\"]\n\n    cwe363 -->|CHILDOF| cwe367\n    cwe363 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe59\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe367 primary\n    class cwe59,cwe363 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition** (CWE-367) during directory removal. This **race condition** enables **symlink following** (CWE-59), which allows an attacker to delete files and directories they shouldn't have access to.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified both CWE-367 and CWE-59 as candidates based on the description which states that the `stdfsremove_dir_all` standard library function is vulnerable a **race condition** enabling **symlink following**. The CVE reference confirms that the function incorrectly implemented a check for symbolic links leading to a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition.\n\nThe retriever results also point to CWE-367 and CWE-59. Specifically, the description states: \"The `std::fs::remove_dir_all` function incorrectly implemented a check for symbolic links leading to a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. The function first checked if a target was a symlink, and if not, proceeded to recursively delete. An attacker could replace a directory with a symlink between the check and the deletion, leading to the function following the symlink.\"\n\nCWE-367 is chosen as the primary CWE because the root cause of the vulnerability is the **race condition**, specifically the TOCTOU aspect. CWE-59 is a secondary CWE because it describes the outcome of the race condition: the ability to follow symbolic links and potentially delete unauthorized files.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-367 is a Base-level CWE, and CWE-59 is also a Base-level CWE. These levels provide sufficient detail to describe the vulnerability without being overly abstract or overly specific.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
