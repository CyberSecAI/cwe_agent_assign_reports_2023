CWE-295, a peer of CWE-322, is also a base-level weakness related to certificate validation issues and is a child of CWE-287. The choice of CWE-347 is favored because the vulnerability description refers to improved checks in code signature validation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification\"]\n    cwe295[\"CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe322[\"CWE-322: Key Exchange Without Entity Authentication\"]\n    \n\n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    cwe295 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe295 --|PEEROF| cwe322\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe295 secondary\n    class cwe345,cwe287,cwe322 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an issue in code signature validation that leads to the ability of an app to bypass code signing checks.\n  - **Root Cause:** Issue in code signature validation.\n  - **Weakness:** Improper verification of cryptographic signature (CWE-347).\n  - **Impact:** An app may be able to bypass code signing checks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the description of the vulnerability as an issue in code signature validation. The primary concern is the **improper verification** of cryptographic signatures. The evidence provided supports this: \"An issue in code signature validation was addressed with improved checks.\" This statement, along with the CVE Reference Links Content Summary highlighting the root cause as \"An issue in code signature validation\" and the weakness as \"Code signature validation bypass\", strongly suggests CWE-347.\n\nThe retriever results also pointed to CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation). While certificate validation can be related to code signing, the description focuses more on the general **improper verification** of signatures, making CWE-347 a more direct match.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-347 is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description and supporting information in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The graph relationships and mapping guidance also support this selection, as CWE-347 is a base-level weakness that directly addresses the issue of **improper signature verification**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
