    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis
    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. 
    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.

    ## WEAKNESS: 'heap overflow'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 265.68)

A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc()....

### 2. CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size (Score: 256.29)

The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow....

### 3. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 249.30)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...

### 4. CWE-193: Off-by-one Error (Score: 241.10)

A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value....

### 5. CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read (Score: 235.78)

The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....

## WEAKNESS: 'out-of-bounds read'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 265.68)

A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc()....

### 2. CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index (Score: 265.56)

The product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array....

### 3. CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (Score: 261.39)

The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data....

### 4. CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size (Score: 256.29)

The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow....

### 5. CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read (Score: 235.78)

The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....
