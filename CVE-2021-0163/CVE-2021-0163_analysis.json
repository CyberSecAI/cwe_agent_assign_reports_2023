It is a child of CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), which is a Class-level CWE. The hierarchical relationship supports selecting CWE-1288 because it's a more specific instance of a general input validation problem.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1288[\"CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe1288 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1288 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper validation of consistency within input** (CWE-1288) which leads to a potential escalation of privilege.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly suggests CWE-1288 (Improper Validation of Consistency within Input) as the primary CWE. The vulnerability description clearly states \"**Improper Validation of Consistency within input**\" as the root cause. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also emphasizes the **improper input validation** as the root cause.\n\nThe retriever results list CWE-1288 as the top combined result with a good score. CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is also listed, but the mapping guidance discourages its use when a more specific CWE is available. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-1288 is a child of CWE-20, making it a more appropriate and specific choice.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-1288 is based on the direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the retriever results. The graph relationships support this choice as it's a more specific instance of the general input validation problem. This ensures the selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input\n\n**CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input**\n\n*   **How the vulnerability's details match the CWE's characteristics:** The vulnerability stems from the **improper validation of consistency** within the input data. This aligns directly with the CWE-1288 description, which focuses on scenarios where input data has multiple elements or fields that must be consistent, but this consistency is not properly validated.\n\n*   **The security implications and potential impact:** The security implication is escalation of privilege, which an attacker can potentially achieve due to the lack of proper consistency checks on the input.\n\n*   **Any parent-child relationships or chain patterns that influenced your mapping:** CWE-1288 is a child of CWE-20, indicating that it is a specific type of input validation issue. This relationship influenced the mapping by guiding the selection toward a more precise CWE.\n\n*   **Whether the weakness is primary or secondary in the vulnerability:** CWE-1288 is the primary weakness as it is the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\n*   **How the official MITRE mapping guidance influenced your decision:** The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-1288 indicates that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level for mapping root causes. The guidance suggests carefully reading the name and description to ensure it's an appropriate fit, which it is in this case.\n\n## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n\n*   CWE-20 was considered but not used because CWE-1288 provides a more specific description of the vulnerability, focusing on the consistency of the input rather than general input validation. The mapping guidance for CWE-20 discourages its use when lower-level CWEs are available.",
