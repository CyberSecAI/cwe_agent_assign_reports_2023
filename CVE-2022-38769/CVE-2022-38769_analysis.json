This is a **root cause** in the vulnerability. CWE-319, Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information, is a potential secondary weakness because fetching the password implies transmission, though the primary issue is the **storage** itself. CWE-256 is a child of CWE-522, and is related to the storage of passwords, but CWE-312 is more specific to general sensitive information, not only passwords.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe312 -->|PEEROF| cwe319\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe319,cwe256 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause**, which is the **cleartext storage of the password (CWE-312)**. This allows an attacker, upon successful login, to **fetch the cleartext password**. The fetching of the password can be considered a form of transmission, potentially leading to CWE-319.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the evidence provided, especially the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" and \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\". The primary weakness is CWE-312, because the core issue is that the passwords are being stored in cleartext.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description:\n*   \"The mobile application in Transtek Mojodat FAM (Fixed Asset Management) 2.4.6 allows remote attackers to **fetch cleartext passwords** upon a successful login request.\"\n*   \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The mobile application **returns cleartext passwords** upon successful login.\"\n\nThe retriever results also support this with CWE-312 scoring well.\n\nCWE-312 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred, and accurately represents the weakness.\n\nCWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) was considered but rejected because the vulnerability description doesn't mention anything about hard-coded credentials. The issue is the **storage** of passwords in **cleartext**.\n\nCWE-284 (Improper Access Control) was considered but rejected because it is too high-level (Pillar) and the problem isn't a general access control issue, it's specifically the **storage of the password in cleartext** once access is granted.\n\nCWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) was considered as a secondary candidate because the vulnerability allows remote attackers to **fetch cleartext passwords**. This action could involve the transmission of the cleartext password, making CWE-319 a relevant, but secondary, consideration.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.042\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nStoring a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
