CWE-614, a variant of CWE-319, describes the specific case of **sensitive cookies being transmitted without the 'Secure' attribute**. The vulnerability description and reference links explicitly state that the administration interface is accessible via plaintext HTTP, leading to the potential capture of session cookies. This aligns directly with CWE-319 and, to a lesser extent, CWE-614.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe614[\"CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"]\n    \n    cwe614 -->|CHILDOF| cwe319\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe614 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** The **administration interface is accessible via plaintext HTTP protocol**, which is the **weakness** that starts the chain.\n2.  Sensitive information (session cookie) is transmitted in **cleartext**.\n3.  **Impact:** A machine-in-the-middle attacker intercepts the session cookie.\n4.  **Impact:** The attacker bypasses authentication by using the captured session cookie.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly suggests CWE-319 as the primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the **administration interface is accessible via plaintext HTTP protocol**, and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the **cleartext transmission of sensitive information**. This evidence directly supports the selection of CWE-319.\n\nCWE-614 was considered because the session cookie is being transmitted in cleartext. However, I have chosen CWE-319 as the primary because the vulnerability lies in the administration interface being accessible via plaintext HTTP, which leads to the potential compromise of any information, not just session cookies.\n\nThe graph relationships helped confirm that CWE-614 is a more specific case of CWE-319.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-319 directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, while CWE-614 is a specific instance of that root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product acts as an intermediary HTTP agent\n         (such as a proxy or firewall) in the data flow between two\n         entities such as a client and server, but it does not\n         interpret malformed HTTP requests or responses in ways that\n         are consistent with how the messages will be processed by\n         those entities that are at the ultimate destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
