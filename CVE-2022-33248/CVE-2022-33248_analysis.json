This can lead to CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write. The relationship is that an integer overflow can precede an out-of-bounds write, causing a buffer overflow.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe190 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **integer overflow** (CWE-190), which then leads to an out-of-bounds write, resulting in a **buffer overflow** (CWE-787).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates an **integer overflow** leading to a **buffer overflow** when a segment is received via qmi http. The key phrases support this assessment, with \"**rootcause:** **integer overflow**\" and \"**weakness:** **buffer overflow**.\"\n\nCWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) is selected as the primary CWE because it's explicitly identified as the root cause. The description of CWE-190, \"The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound...\", aligns with the vulnerability description of an **integer overflow** occurring.\n\nCWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is selected as a secondary CWE because the **buffer overflow** is a direct result of writing data outside the intended buffer bounds due to the integer overflow. The description of CWE-787, \"The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer,\" aligns with the **buffer overflow** condition.\n\nCWE-680 (Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow) was considered but not selected. While this is a named chain that accurately describes the vulnerability, the mapping guidance discourages its use in favor of mapping to each separate weakness in the chain, which is more precise.\nCWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) was considered but discarded because it is a Class-level CWE and the description uses the term \"buffer overflow\" too generally. The child CWE-787 is more specific.\nCWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')) was considered but rejected, as the description doesn't involve a direct buffer copy operation without size checking; rather, it involves an integer overflow that leads to an out-of-bounds write.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-680: Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation to determine how much memory to allocate, but an integer overflow can occur that causes less memory to be allocated than expected, leading to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a named chain, which combines multiple weaknesses.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
