CWE-732 has child relationships to CWE-285 and CWE-668. CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions) is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-732. The relationships show the hierarchy from general permission issues to specific instances of default permission misconfigurations.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe276[\"CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe276 -->|CHILDOF| cwe732\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe732\n    cwe668 -->|CHILDOF| cwe732\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe732 primary\n    class cwe276 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe668 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect default permissions** (CWE-276) leading to **incorrect permission assignment for critical resources** (CWE-732). This allows non-privileged users to overwrite executables and libraries, ultimately resulting in potential access to sensitive data and system compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **default privileges** as the root cause, aligning with **incorrect permission assignment** and **incorrect default permissions**. The vulnerability description explicitly states that non-privileged users can overwrite and manipulate executables and libraries due to these **default privileges**.\n\nThe evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that \"The Remisol Advance Launcher... has insecure file permissions set during installation. These permissions allow non-privileged users to overwrite or manipulate executable files and libraries used by services that run as the SYSTEM user.\"\n\nCWE-732 is the primary CWE because it directly addresses the **incorrect assignment of permissions** for critical resources. While CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions) is more specific, CWE-732 encapsulates the overall issue, especially since the permissions are set during installation, but the impact is on the running service.\n\nCWE-276 was considered because the root cause is specifically related to the **incorrect default permissions**. However, since the impact extends beyond just the initial permission setting, CWE-732 is a more fitting primary classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nDuring installation, installed file permissions are set to allow anyone to modify those files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
