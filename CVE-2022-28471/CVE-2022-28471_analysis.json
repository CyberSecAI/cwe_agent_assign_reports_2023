This leads to an undersized buffer allocation and eventually results in a heap-based out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) when the image data is processed.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe682[\"CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe190 -->|CHILDOF| cwe682\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n    class cwe682,cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **integer overflow** (CWE-190) in the stride calculation, which results in an insufficient buffer size. Subsequently, when the `jfif_encode` function writes image data into this undersized buffer, it leads to a heap-based out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence. The vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly point to an **integer overflow** in the `bmp_load` function, leading to a heap overflow in the `jfif_encode` function.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"In ffjpeg (commit hash caade60), the function bmp_load() in bmp.c contains an **integer overflow** vulnerability, which eventually results in the heap overflow in jfif_encode() in jfif.c. This is due to the incomplete patch for issue 38.\"\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"An **integer overflow** vulnerability exists in the `bmp_load` function when processing BMP image files. Specifically, the multiplication of `pb->width * 3` in `pb->stride = ALIGN(pb->width * 3, 4)` can overflow, resulting in a small value for `pb->stride`. This small `pb->stride` bypasses the size check performed later, leading to a heap buffer overflow.\"\n\nThe relationship graph highlights the link between the **integer overflow** and the out-of-bounds write. CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) is selected as the primary CWE because it is the root cause of the vulnerability. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is selected as a secondary CWE because it is the direct consequence of the integer overflow.
