In this case, the vulnerability involves the exposure of sensitive information due to the missing authorization, making CWE-201 [Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data] a relevant secondary CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n\n    cwe201 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves a **missing authorization** check leading to the **insertion of sensitive information into sent data**. The root cause is the **missing authorization**, and the impact is the information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment and resulting conclusion are heavily based on the provided evidence. The vulnerability description clearly states that the `/v1/internal/ui/nodes` and `/v1/internal/ui/services` HTTP endpoints in Consul do not properly filter information by ACL policies when cluster peering is enabled. This **failure to enforce ACL policies** directly implies a **missing authorization** check, which aligns with CWE-862 [Missing Authorization].\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section explicitly mentions \"Improper access control, information disclosure vulnerability, **failure to enforce ACL policies**.\" This reinforces the selection of CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]. Additionally, the ability to access node and service information without an ACL token indicates that sensitive information is being exposed, supporting the inclusion of CWE-201 [Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data] as a secondary CWE.\n\nThe relationship analysis further supports this decision, as CWE-862 [Missing Authorization] can lead to information disclosure vulnerabilities. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-862 [Missing Authorization] directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, while CWE-201 [Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data] describes the impact of the missing authorization check.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
