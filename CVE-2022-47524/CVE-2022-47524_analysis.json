The **weakness** is that the browser **does not properly handle or validate** Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs), allowing an attacker to use visually similar characters to spoof legitimate domain names. This directly aligns with the description of CWE-1007, \"Insufficient Visual Distinction of Homoglyphs Presented to User,\" which states that the product displays information or identifiers to a user, but the display mechanism does not make it easy for the user to distinguish between visually similar or identical glyphs (homoglyphs), which may cause the user to misinterpret a glyph and perform an unintended, insecure action.\n\nThe retriever results list CWE-1007 as the top candidate. The evidence and description are clear and a direct match. CWE-1007 is also at the base level of abstraction which is preferred.\n\nCWE-451 \"User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\" was considered but is too high level.
