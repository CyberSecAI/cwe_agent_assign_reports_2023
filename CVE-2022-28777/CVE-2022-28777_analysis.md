# Analysis for CVE-2022-28777

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-285 | Improper Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-862, which is a child of CWE-285 and CWE-284. CWE-285 is a more general form of authorization issues, which is a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). The vulnerability description clearly indicates that an authorization check is missing, thus CWE-862 is the more specific and appropriate choice.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper access control**, specifically **missing authorization**, leading to the impact of allowing a local attacker to execute call functions without the CALL_PHONE permission.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment and final conclusion are strongly based on the provided evidence. The vulnerability description states "**Improper access control** vulnerability in Samsung Members prior to version 13.6.08.5 allows local attacker to execute call function **without CALL_PHONE permission**." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms "**Root cause of vulnerability: Improper access control**" and "**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the Samsung Members application, where an **improper access control mechanism allows a local attacker to execute call functions without the necessary CALL_PHONE permission**." This clearly indicates a **missing authorization** check for the call function, making CWE-862 the most accurate and specific classification.

The graph relationships influenced the decision by providing a hierarchy of access control related CWEs. While CWE-285 and CWE-284 are related, they are more general. The evidence specifically points to a **missing authorization** check, which aligns perfectly with CWE-862.

CWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **missing authorization** check, which is the root cause of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges 
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.

## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

## CWE-862: Missing Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 6001.97
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 5965.09
