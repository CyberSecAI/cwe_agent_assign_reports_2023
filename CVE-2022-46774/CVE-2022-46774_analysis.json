CWE-863 is also related to authorization issues, representing a broader class of vulnerabilities. The relationships suggest a hierarchy, where incorrect default permissions can lead to incorrect authorization and ultimately incorrect permission assignments for critical resources. Choosing CWE-276 provides the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe276[\"CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe276 -->|CHILDOF| cwe732\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe276 primary\n    class cwe732,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect default permissions** (CWE-276), leading to a state where users have access to actions they should not have. This represents **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863) and could be viewed as a specific case of **incorrect permission assignment for critical resources** (CWE-732). The initial flaw is in the default configuration, which then results in unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The vulnerability stems from **incorrect default permissions**, as highlighted in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and the CVE reference. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states, \"The vulnerability stems from incorrect default permissions in the IBM Maximo Manage application within IBM Maximo Application Suite. Specifically, the `mxe.int.enableosauth` property, which controls whether object structure security is enabled, was not set correctly by default.\"\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-276 as the top candidate, further supporting this choice.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by providing a hierarchy. While CWE-732 and CWE-863 are related, CWE-276 is more specific to the root cause.\n\nCWE-276 is selected because it's the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability's root cause, aligning with the evidence and the retriever results. It is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
