|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-276 | Incorrect Default Permissions | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-732 | Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource | 0.5 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-276, is a child of CWE-732, suggesting a more specific case of incorrect permission assignment. CWE-863 is also related to authorization issues, representing a broader class of vulnerabilities. The relationships suggest a hierarchy, where incorrect default permissions can lead to incorrect authorization and ultimately incorrect permission assignments for critical resources. Choosing CWE-276 provides the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect default permissions** (CWE-276), leading to a state where users have access to actions they should not have. This represents **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863) and could be viewed as a specific case of **incorrect permission assignment for critical resources** (CWE-732). The initial flaw is in the default configuration, which then results in unauthorized access.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The vulnerability stems from **incorrect default permissions**, as highlighted in the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" and the CVE reference. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states, "The vulnerability stems from incorrect default permissions in the IBM Maximo Manage application within IBM Maximo Application Suite. Specifically, the `mxe.int.enableosauth` property, which controls whether object structure security is enabled, was not set correctly by default."

The retriever results also list CWE-276 as the top candidate, further supporting this choice.

The graph relationships influenced the selection by providing a hierarchy. While CWE-732 and CWE-863 are related, CWE-276 is more specific to the root cause.

CWE-276 is selected because it's the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability's root cause, aligning with the evidence and the retriever results. It is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

*Not selected because it is too general and discouraged.*

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not selected because the vulnerability is not about inserting sensitive information into files or directories.*

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not selected because the vulnerability is not about relying on untrusted inputs.*

## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not selected because the vulnerability is about granting too much access instead of handling insufficient permissions.*

## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.

*Not selected because the vulnerability is about granting too much access instead of handling insufficient privileges.*

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not selected because the vulnerability is not about sensitive information removal.*

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not selected because the vulnerability is not about sensitive information in resource reuse.*

## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This is a possible candidate. There is an implication that there could have been insufficient granularity. The fact the fix was to set a property would suggest otherwise.*

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not selected because the vulnerability is not about user-controlled keys.*
