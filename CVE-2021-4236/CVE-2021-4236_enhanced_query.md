# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-4236

## Vulnerability Description
Web Sockets do not execute any AuthenticateMethod methods which may be set, leading to a **nil pointer dereference** if the returned UserData pointer is assumed to be non-nil, or authentication bypass. This issue only affects WebSockets with an AuthenticateMethod hook. Request handlers that do not explicitly use WebSockets are not vulnerable.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **nil pointer dereference**
- **impact:** authentication bypass

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-4236:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how the `github.com/ecnepsnai/web` library handles WebSocket connections. Specifically, the authentication method (`AuthenticateMethod`) set for a route was not being executed for WebSocket requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** WebSocket requests were not being subjected to the authentication checks defined by the `AuthenticateMethod`. This could allow unauthorized users to access WebSocket endpoints that should be protected.
*   **Nil Pointer Dereference:** The code assumes that the `UserData` returned by the authentication method will not be nil. When authentication isn't performed, the `userData` variable remains nil and can lead to a nil pointer dereference if the endpoint handler uses it without checking for nil.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could bypass authentication and gain access to sensitive WebSocket endpoints.
*   **Application Crash:** If the code relies on the `UserData` being non-nil, exploiting the authentication bypass vulnerability can lead to a nil pointer dereference and potentially crash the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, where an attacker sends a WebSocket request to the affected endpoint.
*   **WebSocket Endpoint:** The vulnerability affects WebSocket endpoints specifically, not standard HTTP request handlers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of WebSocket Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the URL of the vulnerable WebSocket endpoint.
*   **No Authentication Credentials Needed:**  The attacker doesn't need to provide valid authentication credentials, as the vulnerability allows bypassing the authentication mechanism.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The fix for this issue was introduced in commit `5a78f8d5c41ce60dcf9f61aaf47a7a8dc3e0002f`.
*   The vulnerability affects versions of `github.com/ecnepsnai/web` from `v1.4.0` before `v1.5.2`.
*   The specific vulnerable symbol is `Server.Socket`.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the `AuthenticateMethod` is called for WebSocket connections, as seen in the provided diff of `websocket.go`.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-3274:** race condition causes a table to be corrupted if a timer activates while it is being modified, leading to resultant NULL dereference; also involves locking.
- **CVE-2002-1912:** large number of packets leads to NULL dereference
- **CVE-2005-0772:** packet with invalid error status value triggers NULL dereference




## CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product obtains a value from an untrusted source, converts this value to a pointer, and dereferences the resulting pointer.

### Extended Description


An attacker can supply a pointer for memory locations that the product is not expecting. If the pointer is dereferenced for a write operation, the attack might allow modification of critical state variables, cause a crash, or execute code. If the dereferencing operation is for a read, then the attack might allow reading of sensitive data, cause a crash, or set a variable to an unexpected value (since the value will be read from an unexpected memory location).


There are several variants of this weakness, including but not necessarily limited to:


  - The untrusted value is directly invoked as a function call.

  - In OS kernels or drivers where there is a boundary between "userland" and privileged memory spaces, an untrusted pointer might enter through an API or system call (see CWE-781 for one such example).

  - Inadvertently accepting the value from an untrusted control sphere when it did not have to be accepted as input at all. This might occur when the code was originally developed to be run by a single user in a non-networked environment, and the code is then ported to or otherwise exposed to a networked environment.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.

**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of "memory corruption" or "memory safety." As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2007-5655:** message-passing framework interprets values in packets as pointers, causing a crash.
- **CVE-2010-2299:** labeled as a "type confusion" issue, also referred to as a "stale pointer." However, the bug ID says "contents are simply interpreted as a pointer... renderer ordinarily doesn't supply this pointer directly". The "handle" in the untrusted area is replaced in one function, but not another - thus also, effectively, exposure to wrong sphere (CWE-668).
- **CVE-2009-1719:** Untrusted dereference using undocumented constructor.




## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.

### Extended Description
Two common programmer assumptions are "this function call can never fail" and "it doesn't matter if this function call fails". If an attacker can force the function to fail or otherwise return a value that is not expected, then the subsequent program logic could lead to a vulnerability, because the product is not in a state that the programmer assumes. For example, if the program calls a function to drop privileges but does not check the return code to ensure that privileges were successfully dropped, then the program will continue to operate with the higher privileges.

- **CVE-2020-6078:** Chain: The return value of a function returning a pointer is not checked for success (CWE-252) resulting in the later use of an uninitialized variable (CWE-456) and a null pointer dereference (CWE-476)
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).




## CWE-665: Improper Initialization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.

### Extended Description
This can have security implications when the associated resource is expected to have certain properties or values, such as a variable that determines whether a user has been authenticated or not.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-664

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-1471:** chain: an invalid value prevents a library file from being included, skipping initialization of key variables, leading to resultant eval injection.
- **CVE-2008-3637:** Improper error checking in protection mechanism produces an uninitialized variable, allowing security bypass and code execution.
- **CVE-2008-4197:** Use of uninitialized memory may allow code execution.




## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

### Extended Description


If the pointer contains an uninitialized value, then the value might not point to a valid memory location. This could cause the product to read from or write to unexpected memory locations, leading to a denial of service. If the uninitialized pointer is used as a function call, then arbitrary functions could be invoked. If an attacker can influence the portion of uninitialized memory that is contained in the pointer, this weakness could be leveraged to execute code or perform other attacks.


Depending on memory layout, associated memory management behaviors, and product operation, the attacker might be able to influence the contents of the uninitialized pointer, thus gaining more fine-grained control of the memory location to be accessed.

- **CVE-2009-2768:** Pointer in structure is not initialized, leading to NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) and system crash.




## CWE-1385: Missing Origin Validation in WebSockets
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a WebSocket, but it does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.

### Extended Description


WebSockets provide a bi-directional low latency communication (near real-time) between a client and a server. WebSockets are different than HTTP in that the connections are long-lived, as the channel will remain open until the client or the server is ready to send the message, whereas in HTTP, once the response occurs (which typically happens immediately), the transaction completes. 


A WebSocket can leverage the existing HTTP protocol over ports 80 and 443, but it is not limited to HTTP. WebSockets can make cross-origin requests that are not restricted by browser-based protection mechanisms such as the Same Origin Policy (SOP) or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). Without explicit origin validation, this makes CSRF attacks more powerful.


### Alternative Terms
Cross-Site WebSocket hijacking (CSWSH): this term is used for attacks that exploit this weakness

### Relationships

**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-25095:** web console for SIEM product does not check Origin header, allowing Cross Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWH)
- **CVE-2018-6651:** Chain: gaming client attempts to validate the Origin header, but only uses a substring, allowing Cross-Site WebSocket hijacking by forcing requests from an origin whose hostname is a substring of the valid origin.
- **CVE-2018-14730:** WebSocket server does not check the origin of requests, allowing attackers to steal developer's code using a ws://127.0.0.1:3123/ connection.




## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.

### Extended Description


While the product might limit the amount of memory that is allocated in a single operation for a single object (such as a malloc of an array), if an attacker can cause multiple objects to be allocated in separate operations, then this might cause higher total memory consumption than the developer intended, leading to a denial of service.


### Alternative Terms
Stack Exhaustion: When a weakness allocates excessive memory on the stack, it is often described as "stack exhaustion," which is a technical impact of the weakness. This technical impact is often encountered as a consequence of CWE-789 and/or CWE-1325.

- **CVE-2013-1591:** Chain: an integer overflow (CWE-190) in the image size calculation causes an infinite loop (CWE-835) which sequentially allocates buffers without limits (CWE-1325) until the stack is full.




## CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition.

### Extended Description


Race conditions frequently occur in signal handlers, since signal handlers support asynchronous actions. These race conditions have a variety of root causes and symptoms. Attackers may be able to exploit a signal handler race condition to cause the product state to be corrupted, possibly leading to a denial of service or even code execution.


These issues occur when non-reentrant functions, or state-sensitive actions occur in the signal handler, where they may be called at any time. These behaviors can violate assumptions being made by the "regular" code that is interrupted, or by other signal handlers that may also be invoked. If these functions are called at an inopportune moment - such as while a non-reentrant function is already running - memory corruption could occur that may be exploitable for code execution. Another signal race condition commonly found occurs when free is called within a signal handler, resulting in a double free and therefore a write-what-where condition. Even if a given pointer is set to NULL after it has been freed, a race condition still exists between the time the memory was freed and the pointer was set to NULL. This is especially problematic if the same signal handler has been set for more than one signal -- since it means that the signal handler itself may be reentered.


There are several known behaviors related to signal handlers that have received the label of "signal handler race condition":


  - Shared state (e.g. global data or static variables) that are accessible to both a signal handler and "regular" code

  - Shared state between a signal handler and other signal handlers

  - Use of non-reentrant functionality within a signal handler - which generally implies that shared state is being used. For example, malloc() and free() are non-reentrant because they may use global or static data structures for managing memory, and they are indirectly used by innocent-seeming functions such as syslog(); these functions could be exploited for memory corruption and, possibly, code execution.

  - Association of the same signal handler function with multiple signals - which might imply shared state, since the same code and resources are accessed. For example, this can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.

  - Use of setjmp and longjmp, or other mechanisms that prevent a signal handler from returning control back to the original functionality

  - While not technically a race condition, some signal handlers are designed to be called at most once, and being called more than once can introduce security problems, even when there are not any concurrent calls to the signal handler. This can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.

Signal handler vulnerabilities are often classified based on the absence of a specific protection mechanism, although this style of classification is discouraged in CWE because programmers often have a choice of several different mechanisms for addressing the weakness. Such protection mechanisms may preserve exclusivity of access to the shared resource, and behavioral atomicity for the relevant code:

  - Avoiding shared state

  - Using synchronization in the signal handler

  - Using synchronization in the regular code

  - Disabling or masking other signals, which provides atomicity (which effectively ensures exclusivity)

- **CVE-2001-0905:** Attacker can send a signal while another signal handler is already running, leading to crash or execution with root privileges
- **CVE-2001-1349:** unsafe calls to library functions from signal handler




## CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations for the resulting pointer.

### Extended Description


While a pointer can contain a reference to any arbitrary memory location, a program typically only intends to use the pointer to access limited portions of memory, such as contiguous memory used to access an individual array.


Programs may use offsets in order to access fields or sub-elements stored within structured data. The offset might be out-of-range if it comes from an untrusted source, is the result of an incorrect calculation, or occurs because of another error.


If an attacker can control or influence the offset so that it points outside of the intended boundaries of the structure, then the attacker may be able to read or write to memory locations that are used elsewhere in the product. As a result, the attack might change the state of the product as accessed through program variables, cause a crash or instable behavior, and possibly lead to code execution.


### Alternative Terms
Untrusted pointer offset: This term is narrower than the concept of "out-of-range" offset, since the offset might be the result of a calculation or other error that does not depend on any externally-supplied values.

## CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The code uses a variable that has not been initialized, leading to unpredictable or unintended results.

### Extended Description
In some languages such as C and C++, stack variables are not initialized by default. They generally contain junk data with the contents of stack memory before the function was invoked. An attacker can sometimes control or read these contents. In other languages or conditions, a variable that is not explicitly initialized can be given a default value that has security implications, depending on the logic of the program. The presence of an uninitialized variable can sometimes indicate a typographic error in the code.
