It is related to other CWEs as a ChildOf CWE-710 (**Improper Adherence to Coding Standards**), and ChildOf CWE-754 (**Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions**).\nCWE-1385 (**Missing Origin Validation in WebSockets**) is a Variant of CWE-346 (**Origin Validation Error**).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe710[\"CWE-710: Improper Adherence to Coding Standards\"]\n    cwe754[\"CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    cwe1385[\"CWE-1385: Missing Origin Validation in WebSockets\"]\n    cwe346[\"CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\"]\n\n    cwe476 -->|CHILDOF| cwe710\n    cwe476 -->|CHILDOF| cwe754\n    cwe1385 -->|CHILDOF| cwe346\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe476 primary\n    class cwe1385 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **WebSockets do not execute any AuthenticateMethod methods** leading to a **nil pointer dereference** if the returned UserData pointer is assumed to be non-nil, or authentication bypass.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is a **nil pointer dereference**.\nBased on the provided information, the analysis and resulting conclusion is as follows:\n*   The vulnerability description clearly states that the root cause is a **nil pointer dereference**: \"Web Sockets do not execute any AuthenticateMethod methods which may be set, leading to a **nil pointer dereference** if the returned UserData pointer is assumed to be non-nil, or authentication bypass.\"\n*   The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also highlights the **Nil Pointer Dereference**: \"Nil Pointer Dereference: The code assumes that the UserData returned by the authentication method will not be nil. When authentication isn't performed, the userData variable remains nil and can lead to a nil pointer dereference if the endpoint handler uses it without checking for nil.\"\n*   The retriever results confirm the **NULL Pointer Dereference** as the top match with a score of 1.0.\n\nThe other highly ranked results from the retriever results were also considered:\n*   CWE-822 (**Untrusted Pointer Dereference**): This is not the primary issue, as the pointer itself isn't necessarily untrusted, but rather the data it points to is unexpectedly nil.\n*   CWE-252 (**Unchecked Return Value**): While a missing check could contribute, the direct cause is the dereference of a nil pointer.\n*   CWE-665 (**Improper Initialization**): While initialization is related, the core issue is the dereference.\n*   CWE-824 (**Access of Uninitialized Pointer**): Similar to CWE-665, this is related, but the direct cause is the nil dereference.\n*   CWE-1385 (**Missing Origin Validation in WebSockets**): This is a variant that occurs in WebSockets.\n\nThe selection of CWE-476 (**NULL Pointer Dereference**) is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the vulnerability's root cause.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n## CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNPD: Common abbreviation for Null Pointer Dereference\nnull deref: Common abbreviation for Null Pointer Dereference\nNPE: Common abbreviation for Null Pointer Exception\nnil pointer dereference: used for access of nil in Go programs\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-710\nChildOf -> CWE-754\nChildOf -> CWE-754\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

WebSockets are different than HTTP in that the connections are long-lived, as the channel will remain open until the client or the server is ready to send the message, whereas in HTTP, once the response occurs (which typically happens immediately), the transaction completes. \n\nA WebSocket can leverage the existing HTTP protocol over ports 80 and 443, but it is not limited to HTTP. WebSockets can make cross-origin requests that are not restricted by browser-based protection mechanisms such as the Same Origin Policy (SOP) or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). Without explicit origin validation, this makes CSRF attacks more powerful.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nCross-Site WebSocket hijacking (CSWSH): this term is used for attacks that exploit this weakness\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-346\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
