CWE-36 **(Absolute Path Traversal)** is a child of CWE-22 and represents a specific type of path traversal. CWE-73 **(External Control of File Name or Path)** can precede CWE-22, indicating that external control of the file path can lead to a path traversal vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe36[\"CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n\n    cwe36 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe22\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe36,cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves external control of the file path, leading to path traversal.\n  - **Root Cause:** Improper handling of file paths allows external control (CWE-73).\n  - **Weakness:** **Improper limitation of pathname** to restricted directory, resulting in path traversal (CWE-22).\n  - **Specific Instance:** Absolute Path Traversal (CWE-36).\n  - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to files.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed to CWE-22 as the most relevant due to the **absolute path traversal** vulnerability. The Github Security Advisory explicitly states the vulnerability is due to the unsafe use of `Flask send_file` function which allows specifying **absolute paths** to files.\n\nThe final conclusion is that CWE-22 is the primary weakness, with CWE-36 as a more specific instance and CWE-73 as a potential prerequisite.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description clearly supports this classification: \"The meerstein/rbtm repository through 1.5 on GitHub allows **absolute path traversal** because the Flask send_file function is used unsafely.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-22 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it captures the general path traversal issue. CWE-36, while also relevant, is a specific type of path traversal and can be considered as secondary. CWE-73 is also relevant as it highlights the external control aspect of the file path.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
