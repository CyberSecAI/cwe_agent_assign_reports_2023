# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2022-30190

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-94 | Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') | 0.7 | Base | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-73 | External Control of File Name or Path | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship impacting the decision is the parent-child relationship between CWE-913 (Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources) and CWE-94, and the fact that CWE-94 is a base class of weakness. CWE-73 is related to CWE-94 via CANPRECEDE, indicating a potential chain of vulnerabilities. The abstraction levels influenced the selection by preferring the Base level CWEs.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper input sanitization** (likely related to CWE-73), leading to **improper control of code generation** (CWE-94), and culminating in remote code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified CWE-94 as a strong candidate due to the vulnerability description stating that an attacker can "run arbitrary code." The **rootcause** is **improper input sanitization** which is a form of **improper control of code generation**.

CWE-94 is at the Base level of abstraction, which aligns with the preferred level for mapping root causes. The mapping guidance suggests reviewing the entry, acknowledging it is frequently misused for vulnerabilities with a technical impact of "code execution," which does not by itself indicate a root cause weakness. However, in this case, the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the ability to "run arbitrary code" due to the **improper input sanitization**, directly linking the code execution to the **weakness**.

CWE-73 was considered because of its relationship to file name/path control and potential for leading to code injection.

Ultimately, the selection of CWE-94 is based on the explicit evidence of code execution capabilities combined with the **improper input sanitization**. CWE-73 is a secondary contributing factor since the exploit vector involves calling MSDT using a URL protocol, which implies external control over a path or filename.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 8146.95
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
