The CWE description aligns well with the vulnerability description, as it states that the product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\nThe relationship graph shows that CWE-312 is a parent of CWE-316, but CWE-316 is not selected because the vulnerability description does not specify that the data is stored in memory. CWE-312 is also a peer of CWE-256 and CWE-257, which are related to password storage, but these are not selected because the vulnerability description does not explicitly mention passwords.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-312 is based on the direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the high relevance score from the retriever results.
