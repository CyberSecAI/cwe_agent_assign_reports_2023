## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-22, which represents the general case of path traversal. CWE-36, Absolute Path Traversal, is a child of CWE-22 and represents a specific type of path traversal. CWE-73, External Control of File Name or Path, can precede CWE-22, indicating that external control of the filename or path can lead to a path traversal vulnerability. The abstraction levels influenced the selection, favoring the base level for CWE-22 as the most general and applicable root cause.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the external control of the file path (CWE-73), leading to the improper limitation of the pathname to a restricted directory (CWE-22), specifically an absolute path traversal (CWE-36).
  - CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path (User-controlled input)
  - CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') (**Root Cause**)
  - CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal (Specific instance of CWE-22)

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified **absolute path traversal** as the **root cause**, which aligns with CWE-22. The provided evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary confirms the insecure use of `flask.send_file` and `os.path.join`, leading to path traversal.

The final decision is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description: "The lyubolp/Barry-Voice-Assistant repository through 2021-01-18 on GitHub allows **absolute path traversal** because the Flask send_file function is used unsafely." and "Passing untrusted input to `flask.send_file` without proper sanitization"

CWE-22 is at the optimal level of specificity because it captures the general weakness of improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory. CWE-36 is more specific, as it focuses on absolute path traversal, which is mentioned in the vulnerability description. CWE-73 highlights that the file name or path is externally controlled.

CWE-23 (Relative Path Traversal), CWE-24 (Path Traversal: '../filedir'), and CWE-37 (Path Traversal: '/absolute/pathname/here') were considered but not used because the vulnerability description specifically mentions "absolute path traversal." While relative path traversal is a common type of path traversal, the explicit mention of "absolute" makes CWE-36 a better fit as a secondary candidate, and CWE-22 as the primary. CWE-98 (Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program) was considered but not selected because the vulnerability is not specific to PHP.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-31541

## Vulnerability Description
The lyubolp/Barry-Voice-Assistant repository through 2021-01-18 on GitHub allows **absolute path traversal** because the Flask send_file function is used unsafely.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **absolute path traversal**
- **product:** lyubolp/Barry-Voice-Assistant
- **version:** through 2021-01-18
- **component:** Flask send_file function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content discusses a path traversal vulnerability in multiple Flask applications, stemming from the insecure use of `flask.send_file` and `os.path.join`.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- Passing untrusted input to `flask.send_file` without proper sanitization.
- Using `os.path.join` with attacker-controlled input, allowing absolute paths to bypass the intended directory.
- Specifically, the `filename` parameter passed to `flask.send_file` is directly or indirectly controlled by the attacker, enabling them to traverse the file system.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Path traversal (directory traversal) vulnerability.
- Unvalidated user input used in file system operations.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker can access arbitrary files and directories on the server's file system.
- This can lead to exposure of application source code, configuration files, and sensitive system files like passwords.
- In some cases, multiple requests for large files could lead to partial denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**

- HTTP requests to vulnerable endpoints.
- Manipulating URL parameters that are used to construct file paths passed to the `send_file` method.
- Specifically, by including `../` sequences or absolute file paths in the `filename` or `path` parameters, attackers can break out of the intended directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
- No special privileges are needed since the attack is over the network.
-  No user interaction is required.

**Additional Information:**
- The document details a large number of repositories affected by this same vulnerability, all discovered by the same researcher.
- The researcher attempted to use GitHub's Bug Slayer program to gain a bounty for their findings; however, their method of public disclosure resulted in the rejection of their application.
- It was noted that many of the affected repositories are personal projects or have not been actively maintained, and that submitting a CVE for these projects may be excessive as they do not represent widely consumed or supported projects/libraries.
- The vulnerability was identified with the help of CodeQL by Github.
- The issue can be remediated by either using `flask.safe_join` or replacing `flask.send_file` calls with `flask.send_from_directory`
- Some discussion revolved around the validity of the CVE's issued due to the fact that many of the reported projects were personal and non-consumable projects and libraries.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

### Extended Description


Many file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as ".." and "/" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the "../" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as "/usr/local/bin" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.


### Alternative Terms
Directory traversal
Path traversal: "Path traversal" is preferred over "directory traversal," but both terms are attack-focused.

### Relationships

ChildOf -> CWE-706
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add ".txt" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.

**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.

**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing "/" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).

**[Terminology]** 

Like other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use "directory traversal" only to refer to the injection of ".." and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.


Other variants like "absolute pathname" and "drive letter" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve ".." or equivalent.


**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.

**[Research Gap]** 

Incomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that "..\" is vulnerable, but not test "../" which may also be vulnerable.


Any combination of directory separators ("/", "\", etc.) and numbers of "." (e.g. "....") can produce unique variants; for example, the "//../" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama
- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the "\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)




## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as "/abs/path" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

### Extended Description
This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-31503:** Python package constructs filenames using an unsafe os.path.join call on untrusted input, allowing absolute path traversal because os.path.join resets the pathname to an absolute path that is specified as part of the input.
- **CVE-2002-1345:** Multiple FTP clients write arbitrary files via absolute paths in server responses
- **CVE-2001-1269:** ZIP file extractor allows full path




## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

### Extended Description


This could allow an attacker to access or modify system files or other files that are critical to the application.


Path manipulation errors occur when the following two conditions are met:

```
		1. An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.
		2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.
```
For example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** CWE-114 is a Class, but it is listed a child of CWE-73 in view 1000. This suggests some abstraction problems that should be resolved in future versions.

**[Relationship]** 

The external control of filenames can be the primary link in chains with other file-related weaknesses, as seen in the CanPrecede relationships. This is because software systems use files for many different purposes: to execute programs, load code libraries, to store application data, to store configuration settings, record temporary data, act as signals or semaphores to other processes, etc.


However, those weaknesses do not always require external control. For example, link-following weaknesses (CWE-59) often involve pathnames that are not controllable by the attacker at all.


The external control can be resultant from other issues. For example, in PHP applications, the register_globals setting can allow an attacker to modify variables that the programmer thought were immutable, enabling file inclusion (CWE-98) and path traversal (CWE-22). Operating with excessive privileges (CWE-250) might allow an attacker to specify an input filename that is not directly readable by the attacker, but is accessible to the privileged program. A buffer overflow (CWE-119) might give an attacker control over nearby memory locations that are related to pathnames, but were not directly modifiable by the attacker.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)
- **CVE-2008-5748:** Chain: external control of values for user's desired language and theme enables path traversal.
- **CVE-2008-5764:** Chain: external control of user's target language enables remote file inclusion.




## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

### Extended Description
This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.

### Alternative Terms
Zip Slip: "Zip slip" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282]. It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).

- **CVE-2019-20916:** Python package manager does not correctly restrict the filename specified in a Content-Disposition header, allowing arbitrary file read using path traversal sequences such as "../"




## CWE-37: Path Traversal: '/absolute/pathname/here'
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description

## CWE-24: Path Traversal: '../filedir'
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize "../" sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

### Extended Description


This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.


The "../" manipulation is the canonical manipulation for operating systems that use "/" as directory separators, such as UNIX- and Linux-based systems. In some cases, it is useful for bypassing protection schemes in environments for which "/" is supported but not the primary separator, such as Windows, which uses "\" but can also accept "/".

## CWE-98: Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion')
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The PHP application receives input from an upstream component, but it does not restrict or incorrectly restricts the input before its usage in "require," "include," or similar functions.

### Extended Description
In certain versions and configurations of PHP, this can allow an attacker to specify a URL to a remote location from which the product will obtain the code to execute. In other cases in association with path traversal, the attacker can specify a local file that may contain executable statements that can be parsed by PHP.

### Alternative Terms
Remote file include
RFI: The Remote File Inclusion (RFI) acronym is often used by vulnerability researchers.
Local file inclusion: This term is frequently used in cases in which remote download is disabled, or when the first part of the filename is not under the attacker's control, which forces use of relative path traversal (CWE-23) attack techniques to access files that may contain previously-injected PHP code, such as web access logs.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

This is frequently a functional consequence of other weaknesses. It is usually multi-factor with other factors (e.g. MAID), although not all inclusion bugs involve assumed-immutable data. Direct request weaknesses frequently play a role.


Can overlap directory traversal in local inclusion problems.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2004-0285:** Modification of assumed-immutable configuration variable in include file allows file inclusion via direct request.
- **CVE-2004-0030:** Modification of assumed-immutable configuration variable in include file allows file inclusion via direct request.
- **CVE-2004-0068:** Modification of assumed-immutable configuration variable in include file allows file inclusion via direct request.




## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
insecure temporary file: Some people use the phrase "insecure temporary file" when referring to a link following weakness, but other weaknesses can produce insecure temporary files without any symlink involvement at all.
Zip Slip: "Zip slip" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282]. It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).

### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** 

Link following vulnerabilities are Multi-factor Vulnerabilities (MFV). They are the combination of multiple elements: file or directory permissions, filename predictability, race conditions, and in some cases, a design limitation in which there is no mechanism for performing atomic file creation operations.


Some potential factors are race conditions, permissions, and predictability.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-1999-1386:** Some versions of Perl follow symbolic links when running with the -e option, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.
- **CVE-2000-1178:** Text editor follows symbolic links when creating a rescue copy during an abnormal exit, which allows local users to overwrite the files of other users.
- **CVE-2004-0217:** Antivirus update allows local users to create or append to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a logfile.




## CWE-38: Path Traversal: '\absolute\pathname\here'
**Abstraction:** Variant

## CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g. "eval").

### Extended Description
This may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, or at least modify what code can be executed.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-94

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Factors: special character errors can play a role in increasing the variety of code that can be injected, although some vulnerabilities do not require special characters at all, e.g. when a single function without arguments can be referenced and a terminator character is not necessary.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-4181:** Framework for LLM applications allows eval injection via a crafted response from a hosting provider.
- **CVE-2022-2054:** Python compiler uses eval() to execute malicious strings as Python code.
- **CVE-2021-22204:** Chain: regex in EXIF processor code does not correctly determine where a string ends (CWE-625), enabling eval injection (CWE-95), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
