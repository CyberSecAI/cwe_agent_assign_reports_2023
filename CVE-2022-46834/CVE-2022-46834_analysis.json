The description mentions the **use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm**, which directly aligns with the definition of CWE-327. CWE-1240 **Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation** is a child of CWE-327 and is at the Base level of abstraction. The vulnerability description specifies that the issue arises because the user requested weak cipher suites to be used for encryption. This suggests that the implementation itself is risky, which is better captured by CWE-1240.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe1240[\"CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\"]\n    \n    cwe1240 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe327 primary\n    class cwe1240 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm** (CWE-327), leading to the ability for a low-privileged remote attacker to decrypt the encrypted data. The root cause is the choice of a weak cipher suite.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the clear statement in the vulnerability description: \"**Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm**\". This led to the selection of CWE-327 as the primary CWE. However, after a more detailed analysis and criticism of the initial assessment, I recognized that the vulnerability is more accurately described by CWE-1240 **Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation**. The evidence shows that the user can request weak cipher suites, indicating a risky implementation.\n\nThe relationship graph was also helpful in determining whether a child CWE was a better fit. The retriever results showed the scores for candidate CWEs which influenced the final decision.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nCryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors.
