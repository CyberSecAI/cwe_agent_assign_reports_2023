# Analysis for CVE-2022-26157

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-614 | Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-614, is a Variant of CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information), which is a Base CWE. This indicates a hierarchical relationship where CWE-614 is a more specific instance of the general issue described by CWE-319. The selection of CWE-614 is favored due to its precise description of the vulnerability: a sensitive cookie lacking the Secure attribute in an HTTPS session.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness**: the **ASP.NET_Sessionid cookie not being protected by the Secure flag**. This leads to the **impact**: the cookie being prone to interception by an attacker if traffic is sent over unencrypted channels.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment strongly suggests CWE-614 as the primary CWE due to its specific focus on the missing Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions. This aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description. The secondary consideration was CWE-319, a more general class describing the cleartext transmission of sensitive information, because the insecure cookie handling leads to this.

The evidence from the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" and "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" directly supports this assessment:

*   "**weakness**: **ASP.NET_Sessionid cookie is not protected by the Secure flag**"
*   "root_cause: The ASP.NET\_Sessionid cookie is not protected by the Secure flag."
*   "weaknesses: [Missing Secure flag on ASP.NET_Sessionid cookie]"
*   "impact: An attacker can intercept the ASP.NET_Sessionid cookie if traffic is sent over unencrypted channels."

The hierarchical relationship between CWE-614 and CWE-319 reinforces the choice of CWE-614 as the more specific and appropriate classification. The MITRE mapping guidance also supports this by recommending the selection of the most specific variant when available.

The final decision is based on the direct evidence of the missing Secure flag on the cookie, making CWE-614 the optimal level of specificity.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This CWE is not related to the cookie not having the secure flag.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This CWE is not related to the cookie not having the secure flag.

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This CWE is not related to the cookie not having the secure flag.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Considered*: This is a general case of CWE-614, because the cookie is transmitted in cleartext.
*Selected*: As a secondary candidate.

## CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions is not set, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Selected*: This is the primary CWE because the cookie does not have the secure flag set.

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This CWE is not related to the cookie not having the secure flag.

## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
