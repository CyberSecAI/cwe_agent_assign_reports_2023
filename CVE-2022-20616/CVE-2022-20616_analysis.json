CWE-862 is a child of CWE-285, indicating a more specific form of authorization failure, where the authorization check is entirely missing.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe200 -->|RELATED_TO| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the following sequence:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing Authorization** (CWE-862): The plugin lacks a permission check in a form validation method.\n2.  **Impact:** Information Exposure (CWE-200): Attackers with `Overall/Read` access can validate if a credential ID refers to a secret file credential and whether it's a zip file.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the analysis focused on the **missing permission check** as the root cause. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the Jenkins Credentials Binding Plugin **does not perform a permission check** in a method implementing form validation. This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-862 (Missing Authorization): \"The product **does not perform an authorization check** when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating, \"The vulnerability stems from a **missing permission check** within a form validation method of the Credentials Binding Plugin.\" The impact of this **missing authorization** is that attackers with `Overall/Read` access can validate sensitive information, aligning with CWE-200 (Information Exposure).\n\nCWE-862 is chosen as the primary CWE because it precisely captures the root cause, which is the **lack of an authorization check**. While CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is a parent class, CWE-862 provides more specificity. The MITRE mapping guidance for both CWE-862 and CWE-285 suggests examining the children of CWE-285 to find a better fit, which leads to the selection of CWE-862.\n\nCWE-200 (Information Exposure) is a secondary CWE because the **missing authorization** directly leads to sensitive information being exposed. This represents the impact of the vulnerability.\n\nThe retriever results also support the selection of CWE-862, as it is ranked highest among the candidate CWEs.\n\nThe final decision is based on the explicit evidence in the vulnerability description and the CVE summary, the hierarchical relationships between CWEs, and the MITRE mapping guidance. The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, capturing both the root cause and the resulting impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
