This can lead to modification of assumed-immutable data (CWE-471).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identifies the root cause as **Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes (Prototype Pollution)**. This assessment is strongly supported by the provided evidence, particularly the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\".\n\nThe \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section explicitly states:\n- **rootcause:** **Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes (Prototype Pollution)**\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section provides more details:\n- The vulnerability stems from the `parseQueryString` function in MooTools More, specifically how it handles query string parameters, and does not sanitize the keys allowing an attacker to use `__proto__` or `constructor[prototype]` as a key, leading to prototype pollution.\n- **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is the ability to manipulate the prototype of JavaScript objects by injecting specific keys like `__proto__` or `constructor[prototype]`.\n- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `parseQueryString` function doesn't properly sanitize or validate the keys from the query string before using them to create object properties. This allows an attacker to inject malicious keys like `__proto__` or `constructor` which bypass normal object creation and target the prototype.\n\nThe Retriever Results also list CWE-1321 as the top match, further reinforcing this assessment.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1321 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the core issue of prototype pollution, which is a specific type of improperly controlled modification of object attributes.",
