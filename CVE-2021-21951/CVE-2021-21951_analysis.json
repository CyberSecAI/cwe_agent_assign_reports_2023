CWE-1284 is included as a secondary CWE to capture the **lack of input validation** that allows the attacker to control the size/quantity, leading to the out-of-bounds write.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe1284 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe1284,cwe119,cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper validation of the specified quantity in the input (CWE-1284)**, which then leads to an **out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)**, ultimately resulting in **code execution**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-787 as the primary weakness due to the **out-of-bounds write**. The retriever results also suggested CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input). The provided evidence clearly indicates that the code lacks proper validation of the \"nums\" field (or `domain_total`), which is then used to index into an array, leading to the **out-of-bounds write**. Therefore, including CWE-1284 as a secondary weakness helps to provide a more complete picture of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 and CWE-1284 is at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-787 directly describes the **out-of-bounds write**, and CWE-1284 captures the **lack of input validation** on the quantity that leads to the out-of-bounds write.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n#
