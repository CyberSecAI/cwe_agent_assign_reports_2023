CWE-497 is a base level CWE. CWE-200 **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** is a class level CWE and a parent of CWE-497. The relationships helped in choosing the most specific CWE, which is CWE-214.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe214[\"CWE-214: Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe214 -->|CHILDOF| cwe497\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe214 primary\n    class cwe497,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  A **process is invoked with sensitive information**. (CWE-214)\n2.  A CLI user can access this **process invoked with sensitive information**.\n3.  This leads to **information disclosure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that a **process is invoked with sensitive information**, which a CLI user can exploit to achieve information disclosure. This aligns directly with CWE-214 **Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information**.\n\nThe evidence supporting this is:\n*   \"Dell PowerScale OneFS...contain a **process invoked with sensitive information** vulnerability.\"\n*   \"A CLI user may potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to information disclosure.\"\n*   \"The vulnerability stems from a process being invoked with sensitive information within Dell PowerScale OneFS.\"\n*   \"The attacker needs to be a CLI user with low privileges to exploit the vulnerability.\"\n\nCWE-214 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The retriever also lists CWE-214 as the top result.\n\nCWE-497 **Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere** was considered as a secondary CWE, since it is a parent of CWE-214 and the description mentions sensitive system information. This CWE was not selected as the primary because CWE-214 is more specific to the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-200 **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** was also considered because the vulnerability leads to information disclosure. However, CWE-200 is a Class level CWE and is discouraged. Also, it represents the impact rather than the root cause.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-214 directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability and is a Base level CWE. CWE-497 is a base level CWE that is a parent of CWE-214.",
