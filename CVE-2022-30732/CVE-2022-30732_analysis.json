The description explicitly states **Exposure of Sensitive Information**, making CWE-200 a direct match even though it is discouraged. CWE-927 [Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication] is included as a secondary candidate because the vulnerability occurs in `onActivityResult`, which is related to implicit intents in Android applications.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe927[\"CWE-927: Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication\"]\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe213[\"CWE-213: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies\"]\n\n    cwe927 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe213 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe927,cwe532,cwe497,cwe213 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Exposure of Sensitive Information** due to the way the Samsung Account handles `onActivityResult`. The end result is that attackers can access sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **Exposure of Sensitive Information** as the core issue. The retriever results also highlighted CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] as the top candidate. While the CWE description explicitly discourages using CWE-200 due to its high-level nature and potential for misuse, the vulnerability description uses the exact phrase \"**Exposure of Sensitive Information**\", making it difficult to ignore. The description and content summary also point to `onActivityResult` as the point of failure, which is an Android component.\n\nThe selection of CWE-200 is based on the direct mention of \"**Exposure of Sensitive Information**\" in the vulnerability description. The evidence from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section is: \"**weakness:** **Exposure of Sensitive Information**\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section: \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** **Exposure of Sensitive Information** in Samsung Account.\"\n\nThe vulnerability description mentions that the exposure occurs via `onActivityResult`. CWE-927 [Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication] is included as a secondary candidate. `onActivityResult` is commonly used when dealing with implicit intents in Android development. Since implicit intents do not specify a particular application to receive the data, any application can process the intent by using an Intent Filter for that intent which can allow untrusted applications to obtain sensitive data.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at appropriate levels of specificity. CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] captures the general nature of the information exposure, while CWE-927 [Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication] captures the specifics of implicit intent handling in Android. The evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section is: \"The vulnerability lies in how the Samsung Account handles `onActivityResult`, potentially exposing sensitive information.\"\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.",
