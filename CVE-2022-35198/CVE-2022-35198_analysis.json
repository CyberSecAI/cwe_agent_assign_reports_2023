This influenced the selection of the more specific CWE-1393.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1393[\"CWE-1393: Use of Default Password\"]\n    cwe1392[\"CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe1393 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1392\n    cwe1392 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1391\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1393 primary\n    class cwe1392,cwe1391 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward: the **weak default password** (CWE-1393) allows attackers to access database connection information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the presence of a **weak default password** in the Contract Management System. The vulnerability description explicitly states this, providing strong evidence for CWE-1393.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1393 is based on the following evidence from the vulnerability description: \"Contract Management System v2.0 contains a **weak default password** which gives attackers to access database connection information.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by emphasizing the specificity of CWE-1393 as a child of more general categories. The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the use of a default password.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs
