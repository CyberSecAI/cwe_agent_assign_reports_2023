CWE-121 is a **variant** of CWE-787, Out-of-bounds Write, specifying that the buffer is on the stack. CWE-787 is a **base** CWE describing the out-of-bounds write. CWE-119, Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, is a **class** level CWE and a parent of both CWE-120 and CWE-787 but is too general.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input\"]\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe120 primary\n    class cwe121,cwe787 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input** which leads to a **stack-based buffer overflow** and can result in remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, including the vulnerability description and key phrases. The description explicitly mentions a **CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input** vulnerability that could cause a **stack-based buffer overflow**.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states: \"A **CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input** vulnerability exists that could cause a **stack-based buffer overflow**, potentially leading to remote code execution when an attacker sends specially crafted alarm data messages.\"\n\nBased on the explicit mention of **CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input** as the root cause in the vulnerability description, it is selected as the primary CWE. The resulting **stack-based buffer overflow** is a direct consequence, which leads to potential remote code execution.\n\nThe selection of CWE-120 is further supported by the \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section, which lists CWE-120 as the \"Primary CWE Match\" and the \"Top CWE\".\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-120 is a base CWE that accurately describes the root cause, while CWE-121 and CWE-787 provide additional context about the location and nature of the overflow.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n#
