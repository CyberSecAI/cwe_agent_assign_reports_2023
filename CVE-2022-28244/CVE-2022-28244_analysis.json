The secondary CWE, CWE-942 **Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains**, is a Variant-level CWE, which is more specific. CWE-942 is a child of CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization**, CWE-923, and CWE-183 **Permissive List of Allowed Inputs**. It can precede CWE-668 **Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe657[\"CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles\"]\n    cwe942[\"CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe923\n    cwe183[\"CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe942 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe942 -->|CHILDOF| cwe183\n    cwe942 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe657 primary\n    class cwe942 secondary\n    class cwe863,cwe183,cwe668 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **violation of secure design principles** (CWE-657), leading to a bypassing of the content security policy. This allows an attacker to send arbitrarily configured requests to the cross-origin attack target domain (CWE-942). The exploitation requires user interaction, as the victim needs to access a crafted PDF file on an attacker's server.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed towards CWE-657 **Violation of Secure Design Principles** due to the **rootcause** identified in the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary. However, this is a high-level Class CWE. Given the additional detail about bypassing the content security policy, CWE-942 **Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains** was considered as a secondary, more specific weakness.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **violation of secure design principles** as the **rootcause**, which directly aligns with CWE-657. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also states the same. However, the retriever results suggest that CWE-657 is a Class and should be avoided. More specific causes should be identified.\n\nThe vulnerability also involves bypassing the content security policy, allowing an attacker to send arbitrarily configured requests to a cross-origin domain. This suggests that there is a cross-domain policy issue and aligns with CWE-942 **Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains**.\n\nThe evidence supports both CWE-657 and CWE-942. CWE-657 captures the high-level design flaw, while CWE-942 provides a more specific description of the cross-domain policy issue.\n\nThe final decision includes both CWEs. CWE-657 is the primary, as it describes the high-level cause. CWE-942 is a secondary CWE that specifies the cross-domain policy that results from the violation of secure design principles. The usage for CWE-657 is discouraged because it is a level-1 Class.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles\n- CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains\n- CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n- CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n- CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n- CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor",
