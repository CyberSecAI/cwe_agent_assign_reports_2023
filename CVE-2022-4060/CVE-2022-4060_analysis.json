CWE-95 is a variant of CWE-94 which means that CWE-95 is more specific. CWE-306 is child of CWE-287, which is Authentication Issues. The relationships influenced the decision to select CWE-94 as the primary because the code injection is clear, and CWE-95 as a secondary because dynamic evaluation is implied.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe95[\"CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe95 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe95,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to restrict callback functions**, leading to **potential code injection** and **arbitrary code execution**. The chain may also involve **missing authentication** since any visitor can trigger this.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **lack of limitation on callback functions** as the root cause, leading to potential code injection. The vulnerability description clearly states that the plugin **does not limit what callback functions can be called by users**, making it possible for any visitors to run code.\nThis is explicitly stated in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section:\n- **rootcause:** **does not limit what callback functions can be called by users**\n- **impact:** run code\n- **attacker:** any visitors\n\nThe relationship graph shows that CWE-94 is a parent of CWE-95 and a child of CWE-74.\nThe retriever results listed CWE-94 as a top candidate. The mapping guidance for CWE-94 suggests it should be used with review and that it is frequently misused for vulnerabilities with a technical impact of \"code execution.\" However, the vulnerability description here clearly states that the **lack of limitation on callback functions** leads directly to the ability to execute code.\nThe evidence and retriever results led to the conclusion that CWE-94 is the most appropriate primary CWE, with CWE-95 and CWE-306 as secondary candidates. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: While untrusted input is involved, the core issue is the **lack of restriction on callback functions**, not the reliance on untrusted input in a security decision.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: The vulnerability does not involve modifying a key value to access another user's data.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: The vulnerability is not about externally controlling assumed-immutable parameters.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: The vulnerability does not involve validation of unsafe equivalence in input.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: The vulnerability is about a **lack of any restriction** on callback functions, not an incomplete list of disallowed inputs.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: While weak authentication could be related, the core issue is the **absence of restrictions on callback functions**.\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: The vulnerability does not involve improper isolation or compartmentalization.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: While injection is involved, CWE-94 is a more specific description of the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: The vulnerability does not directly relate to handling insufficient privileges.\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: The vulnerability is about a **lack of any restriction** on callback functions, not insufficient granularity of access control.\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6658.02\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: The vulnerability is not related to cross-site scripting.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper",
