However, a more specific CWE might exist depending on the exact nature of the **exposure**.|\n| CWE-497 | Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere | 0.60 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed: This CWE is more specific than CWE-200, focusing on system-level information. This could be relevant if the exposed information is related to the system environment.|\n| CWE-209 | Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information | 0.50 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed: If the **sensitive information** is revealed through error messages, this CWE might be applicable.|\n| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.50 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed: If the **sensitive information** is leaked during data transmission, this CWE could be considered.|\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the decision is the parent-child relationship between CWE-200 and its more specific children, such as CWE-497, CWE-209, and CWE-201. The analysis starts with the high-level CWE-200 but explores the children to find a more precise fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    \n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe209 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe497,cwe209,cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **exposure of sensitive information**, leading to the impact of remote attackers being able to **obtain sensitive information**. The exact mechanism of the **exposure** is unspecified.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment points to CWE-200 because the vulnerability description explicitly states **\"Exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor\"**. The description from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary also mentions the **root_cause** is \"**Exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor vulnerability in the web server component of Synology Media Server**\".\n\nHowever, because the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section identifies the \"rootcause\" as \"**Exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor**\", this suggests that this is the weakness that should be identified.\n\nThe description lacks specific details about how the information is exposed, prompting consideration of child CWEs. If the exposed information is system-related, CWE-497 becomes relevant. If the information is leaked through error messages, CWE-209 is a candidate. If the information is included in transmitted data, CWE-201 is applicable.\n\nUltimately, the selection of CWE-200 is based on the direct statement in the vulnerability description. However, the confidence is not 1.0 because a more specific CWE may be appropriate if additional details were available.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-213: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product's intended functionality exposes information to certain actors in accordance with the developer's security policy, but this information is regarded as sensitive according to the intended security policies of other stakeholders such as the product's administrator, users, or others whose information is being processed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
