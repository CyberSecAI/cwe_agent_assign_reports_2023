It is a child of CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption), which is a more general class-level CWE. CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is a base-level CWE and can precede CWE-770 in a vulnerability chain. This relationship suggests that the **lack of validation** (CWE-1284) directly enables the uncontrolled allocation of resources (CWE-770).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe770\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe1284 secondary\n    class cwe400 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of length validation** (CWE-1284), which allows an attacker to create a large Issue description. This leads to uncontrolled allocation of resources (CWE-770) and ultimately saturates CPU usage, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-1284 (**lack of length validation**)\n  - **Weakness:** CWE-770 (uncontrolled resource allocation)\n  - **Impact:** Saturate CPU usage (Denial of Service)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** and **CWE for similar CVE Descriptions**, pointed towards CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) as the primary weakness. The retriever results also suggested CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input). The relationship analysis confirmed that CWE-1284 can precede CWE-770 in a vulnerability chain, indicating that the **lack of length validation** directly contributes to the resource exhaustion. The final decision is to map both CWE-770 as the primary issue and CWE-1284 as a secondary issue. This assessment is based on the vulnerability description mentioning the **lack of length validation** as the root cause for the CPU saturation.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause (**lack of length validation**) and the resulting weakness (uncontrolled resource allocation).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
