## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the ChildOf relationship between CWE-78 and CWE-77. CWE-78 is a Base level CWE that describes **improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS Command**. CWE-77 is a Class level CWE that describes **improper neutralization of special elements used in a command**. Because the vulnerability description specifies that the **command injection** occurs within the context of the operating system, CWE-78 is a more precise classification than CWE-77.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper user-input sanitization** (CWE-20), which leads to **OS command injection** (CWE-78). The ability to inject commands allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is **improper user-input sanitization** leading to **command injection**. The evidence from the vulnerability description, specifically the phrases "**improper user-input sanitization**" and "**command injection**," strongly suggests a command injection vulnerability. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section explicitly states that "This function was vulnerable to command injection due to improper sanitization of user input" and "The core issue is that the `bin` argument is directly used to construct a shell command without proper sanitization or escaping."

The retriever results and complete CWE specifications were then analyzed to determine the most accurate CWE. CWE-78, **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')**, was chosen as the primary CWE because it best describes the vulnerability where **improper sanitization** allows an attacker to inject OS commands.

CWE-20, **Improper Input Validation**, was considered as a secondary CWE because the root cause is **improper sanitization** of user input, which is a form of **improper input validation**. However, CWE-20 is a more general weakness, and CWE-78 is more specific to the type of injection occurring.

The hierarchical relationship between CWE-78 and CWE-77 was considered, and CWE-78 was chosen because it is more specific, indicating that the injection occurs in the context of an OS command.

The final decision is based on the available evidence, the CWE specifications, and the relationship analysis, leading to the selection of CWE-78 as the primary CWE and CWE-20 as a secondary CWE. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-78 being a Base level CWE and CWE-20 being a Class level CWE.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-838: Inappropriate Encoding for Output Context
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses or specifies an encoding when generating output to a downstream component, but the specified encoding is not the same as the encoding that is expected by the downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1236: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product saves user-provided information into a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as a command when the file is opened by a spreadsheet product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the
