Given the specifics of the vulnerability description, CWE-863 is the most appropriate and specific choice. While CWE-284 is a broader category, the **incorrect** authorization implementation is the **root cause**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause**: **restrictions are not performed on Server side** to ensure the user has required permission before processing requests, leading to the **impact**: an authenticated, remote attacker can access resources that they should not be able to access and perform actions that they should not be able to perform.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a clear case of **incorrect** authorization, as the server-side restrictions are not properly implemented. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section highlights the **root cause** as \"**restrictions are not performed on Server side**\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms the **root cause** is a lack of server-side restrictions to verify user permissions. This aligns perfectly with CWE-863's description: \"The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\"\n\nCWE-284 is a Pillar and is too high-level. The mapping guidance for CWE-284 explicitly discourages its use and suggests considering more specific descendants, such as CWE-863.\nThe retriever results also list CWE-863 as the top candidate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
