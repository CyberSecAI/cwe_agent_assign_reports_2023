The **inadequate inspection of the Server Name Identification (SNI) header in the SSL/TLS handshake** is the root cause from the CVE reference link content summary. This leads to the ability to bypass filtering technology and exfiltrate data.\n\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation because the vulnerability stems from **inadequate filtering of the SSL handshake**. The SSL handshake involves certificate validation, and the description indicates that this process is not being done correctly, leading to the bypass of security measures.\n\nCWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor is considered as a secondary CWE because the impact of the vulnerability is data exfiltration, which falls under the category of exposing sensitive information. However, CWE-200 is a high-level class and is often misused. The actual weakness lies in the **inadequate filtering**, not necessarily in the exposure itself.\n\nCWE-807 Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision is another secondary CWE. The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass filtering technology because the system relies on the SSL handshake data, which is essentially an untrusted input, to make security decisions.\n\nThe evidence supporting these mappings comes directly from the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The description explicitly mentions the **inadequate filtering of the SSL handshake** and the ability to bypass filtering technology and exfiltrate data.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision by providing context on how the different CWEs relate to each other. For example, CWE-295 is related to CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), which highlights the importance of proper authentication in security.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause and the immediate impact of the vulnerability. CWE-295 captures the **inadequate filtering of the SSL handshake**, while CWE-200 and CWE-807 capture the impact of data exfiltration and the reliance on untrusted inputs, respectively.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
