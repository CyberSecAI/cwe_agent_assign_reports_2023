It is a child of the class-level CWE-119, which describes improper restrictions within a memory buffer. The relationship between CWE-787 and CWE-119 indicates that the out-of-bounds write is a specific type of memory buffer issue. The base-level CWE is chosen for its specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with **insecure handling** of a malicious file. This leads to **memory corruption**, specifically an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). The impact of this is arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **memory corruption** due to **insecure handling** of a malicious file. The evidence from the vulnerability description key phrases and the CVE reference links content summary strongly supports this. The primary CWE is CWE-787, which accurately represents the out-of-bounds write condition. CWE-119 is added as a secondary CWE as it is the parent of CWE-787 and captures the broader class of memory corruption issues.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"Adobe Premiere Pro version 15.4.1 (and earlier) is affected by a **memory corruption** vulnerability due to **insecure handling** of a malicious file, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.\"\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"A memory access vulnerability exists where the software attempts to access a memory location beyond the allocated buffer.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 is based on its direct representation of the weakness, and it is at the appropriate level of specificity (Base). The retriever results also ranked CWE-787 as the top candidate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is related to resource management, which is not the core issue described in the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE focuses on incorrect size calculation during allocation, which is not explicitly mentioned in the vulnerability description. While it could be a contributing factor, there isn't enough evidence to confirm it.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE relates to improper validation of unsafe equivalence in input, which is not the direct cause described in the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE relates to locking issues, which are not mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n*Not Selected*: This is a high-level CWE and too general to accurately describe the specific vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: The description explicitly mentions \"memory corruption\" and \"access a memory location beyond the allocated buffer\", which strongly implies a write operation rather than a read.\n\n## CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available. It also overlaps existing CWE entries and might be deprecated in the future.\n\n*Not Selected*: The description explicitly mentions \"memory corruption\" and \"access a memory location beyond the allocated buffer\", which strongly implies a write operation. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a more specific and appropriate match.\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is too general and doesn't directly relate to memory corruption.\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE focuses on excessive memory allocation, which isn't the primary issue described in the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE focuses on sequential memory allocation issues, which are not explicitly mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wra",
