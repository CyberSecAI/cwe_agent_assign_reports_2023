The Retriever Results list CWE-327 as the top candidate, and it aligns well with the description. While CWE-1240 is also a strong candidate, the description doesn't explicitly mention non-standard or disallowed cryptographic implementations, so CWE-327 is more appropriate.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision is primarily the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**, specifically the root cause: \"**weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms**.\"\n\nCWE-327 is a Class-level CWE, while CWE-1240 is a Base-level CWE. The mapping guidance for CWE-327 suggests examining its children for a better fit, but since the description does not include enough information to confidently say that the cryptographic algorithm is non-standard or disallowed, CWE-327 is selected because it is the most accurate and specific choice based on the available information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 6131.42\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.395\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores or transmits sensitive data using an encryption scheme that is theoretically sound, but is not strong enough for the level of protection required.
