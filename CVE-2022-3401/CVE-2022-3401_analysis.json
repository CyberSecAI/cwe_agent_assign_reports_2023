It is a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) and CWE-913 (Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources). The secondary CWE is CWE-862 which is a class level CWE and a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). There isn't a direct relationship shown between CWE-94 and CWE-862, however, the vulnerability description indicates that the two vulnerabilities occur together. The combination of these vulnerabilities enables remote code execution.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **allowing site editors to include executable code blocks** (CWE-94) and the missing authorization (CWE-862). An attacker leverages the missing authorization to edit any page, post, or template and injects a code execution block, leading to remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment correctly identifies the two key weaknesses contributing to the vulnerability: the **allowing site editors to include executable code blocks** (CWE-94) and the missing authorization (CWE-862). The final conclusion emphasizes the importance of addressing both vulnerabilities to prevent remote code execution.\n\nThe selection of CWE-94 is based on the fact that the Bricks theme **allows site editors to include executable code blocks**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section states \"The Bricks theme for WordPress **allows site editors to include executable code blocks** in website content.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is supported by the vulnerability description, \"...combined with the missing authorization vulnerability (CVE-2022-3400), makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber, can edit any page, post, or template...\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section mentions \"Missing authorization checks on the `bricks_save_post` AJAX action (CVE-2022-3400), allowing unauthorized users to edit site content.\"\n\nCWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) was considered but not selected. While the vulnerability involves injecting code, the primary issue is the ability to inject executable code blocks due to **allowing site editors to include executable code blocks** and the missing authorization, rather than a failure to neutralize input during web page generation. CWE-79 is more about injecting script into a web page, rather than injecting code blocks.\nCWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)) was also considered but not selected. CSRF involves tricking a user into submitting a request without their consent. While CSRF could potentially be used in conjunction with this vulnerability, it is not a direct cause or requirement for the exploit.\nCWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) was considered but not selected as the missing authorization is a more precise description of the vulnerability than missing authentication.\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was considered but not selected as the missing authorization is a more precise description of the vulnerability than incorrect authorization.\nCWE-96 (Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')) was also considered but not selected because the code is not being injected into statically saved code.",
