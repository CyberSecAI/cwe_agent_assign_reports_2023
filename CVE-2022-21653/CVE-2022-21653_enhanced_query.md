# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-21653

## Vulnerability Description
Jawn is an open source JSON parser. Extenders of the `org.typelevel.jawn.SimpleFacade` and `org.typelevel.jawn.MutableFacade` who dont override `objectContext()` are vulnerable to a **hash collision attack** which may result in a denial of service. Most applications do not implement these traits directly, but inherit from a library. `jawn-parser-1.3.1` fixes this issue and users are advised to upgrade. For users unable to upgrade override `objectContext()` to use a collision-safe collection.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **hash collision attack**
- **impact:** denial of service
- **attacker:** Extenders of the org.typelevel.jawn.SimpleFacade and org.typelevel.jawn.MutableFacade
- **product:** Jawn
- **version:** before 1.3.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21653:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of Scala's default `Map` implementation within `SimpleFacade` and `MutableFacade` in the `jawn` library. This default `Map` is susceptible to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via hash collisions. Specifically, an attacker can craft input that forces multiple keys to hash to the same location in the hash trie. This leads to a performance bottleneck as the application tries to add more elements, causing resource exhaustion due to poor efficiency.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Hash Collision Vulnerability:** The core vulnerability is the reliance on a hash-based map that doesn't provide adequate protection against hash collisions. The default Scala `Map` uses a hash trie, which can degrade to O(n) performance when many keys map to the same hash bucket.
- **Insecure Default Implementation:**  The default implementations of `objectContext()` in `SimpleFacade` and `MutableFacade` use the vulnerable `Map` implementation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker can trigger a denial-of-service condition by submitting specially crafted JSON inputs with many keys that cause hash collisions, leading to severe performance degradation and potential resource exhaustion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted JSON Input:** The attack vector involves providing JSON input with many keys that hash to the same bucket when parsed by the `jawn` library via the vulnerable `SimpleFacade` and `MutableFacade`. This input doesn't have to be malformed or invalid; it just needs to have colliding hash keys

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Control Input:** The attacker needs to be able to control the input being provided to the `jawn` library. This could be through an API, file processing, or any other mechanism that allows the attacker to supply JSON data to an application using the vulnerable library.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
- The vulnerability affects libraries that extend `SimpleFacade` and `MutableFacade` and don't override `objectContext()`. This includes, but is not limited to `org.http4s :: http4s-play-json`, `org.typelevel :: jawn-ast` (< 0.8.0), `org.typelevel :: jawn-play` , `org.typelevel :: jawn-rojoma` and `org.typelevel :: jawn-spray`.
- The fix involved switching from the default `Map` to `TreeMap` which has better guarantees against hash collisions.
- The vulnerability is fixed in `jawn-parser-1.3.2`
- A workaround involves overriding `objectContext()` in custom implementations with a collision-safe map.
- The issue was reported and patched by `@kag0`

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).

### Extended Description


A hash function is defined as an algorithm that maps arbitrarily sized data into a fixed-sized digest (output) such that the following properties hold:


  1. The algorithm is not invertible (also called "one-way" or "not reversible")

  1. The algorithm is deterministic; the same input produces the same digest every time

 Building on this definition, a cryptographic hash function must also ensure that a malicious actor cannot leverage the hash function to have a reasonable chance of success at determining any of the following:

  1. the original input (preimage attack), given only the digest

  1. another input that can produce the same digest (2nd preimage attack), given the original input

  1. a set of two or more inputs that evaluate to the same digest (birthday attack), given the actor can arbitrarily choose the inputs to be hashed and can do so a reasonable amount of times

What is regarded as "reasonable" varies by context and threat model, but in general, "reasonable" could cover any attack that is more efficient than brute force (i.e., on average, attempting half of all possible combinations). Note that some attacks might be more efficient than brute force but are still not regarded as achievable in the real world.

Any algorithm that does not meet the above conditions will generally be considered weak for general use in hashing.


In addition to algorithmic weaknesses, a hash function can be made weak by using the hash in a security context that breaks its security guarantees. For example, using a hash function without a salt for storing passwords (that are sufficiently short) could enable an adversary to create a "rainbow table" [REF-637] to recover the password under certain conditions; this attack works against such hash functions as MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2.

## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description

- **CVE-2020-5243:** server allows ReDOS with crafted User-Agent strings, due to overlapping capture groups that cause excessive backtracking.




## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.

### Extended Description
Some regular expression engines have a feature called "backtracking". If the token cannot match, the engine "backtracks" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.
 Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:


  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.

  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.

  - The input can be long enough.

 Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. 

### Alternative Terms
ReDoS: ReDoS is an abbreviation of "Regular expression Denial of Service".
Regular Expression Denial of Service: While this term is attack-focused, this is commonly used to describe the weakness.
Catastrophic backtracking: This term is used to describe the behavior of the regular expression as a negative technical impact.

## CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component that specifies attributes that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control modifications of attributes of the object prototype.

### Extended Description


By adding or modifying attributes of an object prototype, it is possible to create attributes that exist on every object, or replace critical attributes with malicious ones. This can be problematic if the product depends on existence or non-existence of certain attributes, or uses pre-defined attributes of object prototype (such as hasOwnProperty, toString or valueOf).


This weakness is usually exploited by using a special attribute of objects called proto, constructor or prototype. Such attributes give access to the object prototype. This weakness is often found in code that assigns object attributes based on user input, or merges or clones objects recursively.

## CWE-834: Excessive Iteration
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an iteration or loop without sufficiently limiting the number of times that the loop is executed.

### Extended Description
If the iteration can be influenced by an attacker, this weakness could allow attackers to consume excessive resources such as CPU or memory. In many cases, a loop does not need to be infinite in order to cause enough resource consumption to adversely affect the product or its host system; it depends on the amount of resources consumed per iteration.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
