The vulnerability description also discussed a hash collision attack, so CWE-328 was chosen based on that. CWE-407 was considered as a possible generalization of the specific hash collision issue, but CWE-328 was chosen as the primary as it more closely aligns with the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe328 primary\n    class cwe407,cwe1333 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a weak hash** (CWE-328) in the default Scala `Map` implementation. This leads to **inefficient algorithmic complexity** (CWE-407) due to hash collisions. The impact of this chain is a **denial of service**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points to **CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash)** as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **\"hash collision attack\"**, and the CVE reference summary details the root cause as the use of Scala's default `Map` implementation, which is susceptible to DoS via hash collisions. The fix involved switching to `TreeMap`, which better handles hash collisions. This evidence directly supports the selection of CWE-328.\n\nThe description states, \"Extenders of the `org.typelevel.jawn.SimpleFacade` and `org.typelevel.jawn.MutableFacade` who dont override `objectContext()` are vulnerable to a **hash collision attack** which may result in a denial of service.\"\n\n**CWE-407 (Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity)** was considered because a hash collision leads to an algorithm performing slower than expected. This is definitely the case, but hash collisions are a specific type of algorithmic inefficiency related to **weak hashes**.\n\n**CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity)** was considered because it is related to algorithmic complexity and can cause DoS, but it is not applicable because the vulnerability does not involve regular expressions.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-328 directly addresses the root cause (weak hash), while CWE-407 and CWE-1333 represent broader categories of algorithmic inefficiency.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
