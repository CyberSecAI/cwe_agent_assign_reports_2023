This parent-child relationship indicates that CWE-201 is a more specific type of information exposure. Several other CWEs like CWE-209 and CWE-202 are also related to CWE-200, representing different ways sensitive information can be exposed. The class CWE-863 is a child of the class CWE-285, which in turn is a child of the pillar CWE-284. This means that CWE-863 is a more specific form of authorization issue than CWE-285 or CWE-284.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe285 secondary\n    class cwe200,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **improper access control** issue, which leads to the exposure of team creator's email addresses via one of the APIs. The **root cause** is the **improper access control**, and the impact is the disclosure of sensitive information. This can be mapped as follows: **Improper Access Control** -> **Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered CWE-200, CWE-863, and CWE-285 based on the retriever results. However, after analyzing the vulnerability description, the primary weakness is the **insertion of sensitive information** into the API response. This aligns with CWE-201, which is a more specific case of CWE-200. The vulnerability description states that the system **fails to protect email addresses** and allows authenticated team members to access this information via an API. This direct insertion of sensitive data into the API response makes CWE-201 a more appropriate choice than the more general CWE-200.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) were considered because the vulnerability description mentions **improper access control**. While these CWEs could be related, the core issue is the exposure of data in the API response, rather than a general authorization failure.\n\nThe selection of CWE-201 is based on the evidence in the vulnerability description stating that email addresses are exposed via an API. This aligns with the description of CWE-201 as transmitting data to another actor with sensitive information that should not be accessible. This is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the specific flaw of inserting sensitive information into the API response.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
