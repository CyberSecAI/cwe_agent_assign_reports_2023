CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) and CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) are related because the default key could potentially be hard-coded. CWE-1394 is at the Base level, which is the preferred level of abstraction. CWE-321 is a Variant of CWE-798. These relationships help to refine the classification and provide a more complete picture of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1394[\"CWE-1394: Use of Default Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe321 -->|EXAMPLE| cwe1394\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1394 primary\n    class cwe321,cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a common encryption key across all deployed instances** (CWE-1394, Use of Default Cryptographic Key). This leads to the impact of being able to **recover encrypted value to plaintext**. The key is also hard-coded so this would be a vulnerability chain of CWE-1394 -> CWE-321 -> Plaintext Recovery.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The primary weakness is the **use of a common encryption key**, which is best represented by CWE-1394 (Use of Default Cryptographic Key).\n\nThe description states: \"**Common encryption key appears to be used across all deployed instances of Serv-U FTP Server**. Because of this an encrypted value that is exposed to an attacker can be simply recovered to plaintext.\" This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-1394, which describes the use of a default cryptographic key for potentially critical functionality. The evidence also states: \"**Root cause of vulnerability**: A common encryption key is used across all deployed instances of Serv-U FTP Server.\"\n\nCWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) and CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) were considered because the default key might be hard-coded. However, the primary issue is the use of a common key across multiple instances, making CWE-1394 the most appropriate primary classification.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) and directly reflects the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
