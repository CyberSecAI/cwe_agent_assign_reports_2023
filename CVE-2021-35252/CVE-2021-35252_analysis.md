# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1394 | Use of Default Cryptographic Key | 1 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: Best matches the use of a common encryption key across all instances. |
| CWE-321 | Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key | 0.7 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE: A hard-coded key is being used as a default |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-1394, which indicates the use of a default cryptographic key. CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) and CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) are related because the default key could potentially be hard-coded. CWE-1394 is at the Base level, which is the preferred level of abstraction. CWE-321 is a Variant of CWE-798. These relationships help to refine the classification and provide a more complete picture of the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a common encryption key across all deployed instances** (CWE-1394, Use of Default Cryptographic Key). This leads to the impact of being able to **recover encrypted value to plaintext**. The key is also hard-coded so this would be a vulnerability chain of CWE-1394 -> CWE-321 -> Plaintext Recovery.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The primary weakness is the **use of a common encryption key**, which is best represented by CWE-1394 (Use of Default Cryptographic Key).

The description states: "**Common encryption key appears to be used across all deployed instances of Serv-U FTP Server**. Because of this an encrypted value that is exposed to an attacker can be simply recovered to plaintext." This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-1394, which describes the use of a default cryptographic key for potentially critical functionality. The evidence also states: "**Root cause of vulnerability**: A common encryption key is used across all deployed instances of Serv-U FTP Server."

CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) and CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) were considered because the default key might be hard-coded. However, the primary issue is the use of a common key across multiple instances, making CWE-1394 the most appropriate primary classification.

The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) and directly reflects the root cause of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
To fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.
