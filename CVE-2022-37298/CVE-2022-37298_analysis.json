CWE-807 (**Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision**) is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-693, representing a potential cause. CWE-916 (**Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort**) is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-328 and CWE-327, representing another potential cause. The relationships show that **Weak Authentication** can stem from **Reliance on Untrusted Inputs** or **Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe807[\"CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\"]\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n\n    cwe1390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe807 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe328\n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1390 primary\n    class cwe807,cwe916 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **weak authentication scheme** in the `SafeUnpickler` class. This leads to **insecure deserialization** because the system trusts the data it receives. The **lack of authentication** allows attackers to send crafted pickle objects, resulting in Remote Code Execution (RCE).\n  - Root Cause: **Weak Authentication Scheme**\n  - Weakness: Insecure Deserialization, Lack of Authentication, Insufficient Whitelisting\n  - Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description and key phrases, points to **CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication)** as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description mentions a \"**weak authentication scheme**\" in the `SafeUnpickler` class, which is used to unserialize objects. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary provides more detail, stating that the `SafeUnpickler` class had a flawed implementation of input validation and lacked proper authentication for incoming pickled objects.\n\nThe Retriever results also suggest **CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication)** as a strong candidate.\n\nThe relationship graph shows that **CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication)** can be caused by issues like **CWE-807 (Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision)** or **CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort)**. These are considered secondary because they describe potential causes or contributing factors to the **weak authentication**.\n\nThe decision to select **CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication)** is based on the evidence that the `SafeUnpickler` class has a flawed implementation of input validation and lacks proper authentication. This is a clear indication of a **weak authentication scheme**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because **CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication)** directly addresses the **weakness** described in the vulnerability. The secondary CWEs provide additional context about the potential causes of the **weak authentication**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n### Vulnerability Details and Justification:\nThe vulnerability description indicates that the `SafeUnpickler` class implements a **weak authentication scheme** when unserializing objects. This aligns perfectly with the description of **CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication)**, which states that the product uses an authentication mechanism that does not sufficiently prove the claimed identity is correct.\n### Security Implications:\nAttackers can bypass the authentication mechanism, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system.\n### Influence of Mapping Guidance:\nThe mapping guidance for **CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication)** suggests that it is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate. However, in this case, the description of **weak authentication** directly matches the vulnerability, making it the most appropriate choice.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n### Vulnerability Details and Justification:\nThe `SafeUnpickler` class relies on the input (the pickled object) without properly authenticating or validating it. An attacker can modify the pickled object to bypass the intended protection mechanism. This aligns with **CWE-807 (Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision)**.\n### Security Implications:\nAttackers can bypass the security of the software by modifying untrusted inputs.\n### Influence of Mapping Guidance:\nThe mapping guidance for **CWE-807 (Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision)** states that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction. This supports the selection of this CWE.\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n### Vulnerability Details and Justification:\nAlthough not explicitly mentioned, the **weak authentication scheme** could involve a weak hashing algorithm or insufficient computational effort, making it easier to crack passwords.\n### Security Implications:\nAttackers can crack passwords more easily, gaining unauthorized access to the system.\n### Influence of Mapping Guidance:\nThe mapping guidance for **CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort)** states that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction.\n\n## Considered but not used:\n- **CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource):** While incorrect access control is mentioned, the root cause isn't about permission assignment but rather the **weak authentication**. Therefore, this CWE is not the most appropriate.\n- **CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key):**  Similar to CWE-732, the core issue is **weak authentication** rather than manipulating keys for authorization bypass.\n- **CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm)** and **CWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength)** These were considered as they relate to cryptographic weaknesses. However, the evidence focuses more on **weak authentication** and **insecure deserialization** than on the use of broken algorithms. While a weak cryptographic algorithm might be a contributing factor, it is not the primary weakness.",
