CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). The relationship analysis influenced the decision to choose the most specific CWE, CWE-121, as it directly matches the vulnerability description. CWE-120, while relevant, is a more general case of a buffer overflow. CWE-676 is included because `sprintf` is a potentially dangerous function that is misused.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size\"]\n    cwe676[\"CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function\"]\n\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe120,cwe676 secondary\n    class cwe787,cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the use of `sprintf` without length checks. This leads to a **stack-based buffer overflow** (CWE-121) when processing the `entrys` and `mitInterface` parameters. The overflow can then lead to denial of service (DoS) or remote code execution (RCE).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, specifically the \"**stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerability in function fromAddressNat\" and \"The function `sprintf` copies user-provided parameters (`entrys` and `mitInterface`) into a stack-based buffer `s` without any length checks.\" The graph relationships helped to refine the selection to the most specific CWE, CWE-121. The choice of CWE-121 is at the optimal level of specificity because the vulnerability is explicitly a stack-based buffer overflow.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\nThis was considered but not chosen because the vulnerability is clearly a
