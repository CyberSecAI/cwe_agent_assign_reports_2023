It has hierarchical relationships as a `ChildOf` CWE-662. While there are no direct chain relationships explicitly listed for CWE-667, the extended description and observed examples highlight how improper locking can lead to race conditions (e.g., CWE-362). The abstraction level influenced the decision by favoring the Class level for its specificity. The other CWEs are higher level, and therefore, less descriptive of the actual weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe662[\"CWE-662: Operation on Resource in Wrong Phase of Its Lifecycle\"]\n    cwe691[\"CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    \n\n    cwe667 -->|CHILDOF| cwe662\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe667 primary\n    class cwe662,cwe691,cwe693 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper locking** (CWE-667) in the Power Management Controller (PMC), leading to a race condition, which ultimately results in a denial of service.\n  - CWE-667 (Root Cause) -> Race Condition (Potential) -> Denial of Service (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed towards CWE-667 due to the explicit mention of \"**improper locking**\" in both the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The retriever results also listed CWE-667 as the top candidate. This assessment is heavily based on the provided evidence, specifically:\n\n*   \"**Improper locking in the Power Management Controller (PMC) for some Intel Chipset firmware**\" (Vulnerability Description Key Phrases)\n*   \"**Root cause of vulnerability: Improper locking in the Power Management Controller (PMC).**\" (CVE Reference Links Content Summary)\n\nThe graph relationships reinforced the selection, as the parent-child relationship with CWE-662 provides a broader context, but CWE-667 remains the most specific and accurate representation of the **weakness**.\n\nCWE-691 and CWE-693 were considered but ultimately deemed less specific. While they touch upon control flow and protection mechanisms, the core issue is the **improper locking** itself. Therefore, CWE-667 is at the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1263: Improper Physical Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is designed with access restricted to certain information, but it does not sufficiently protect against an unauthorized actor with physical access to these areas.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1299: Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe lack of protections on alternate paths to access\n                control-protected assets (such as unprotected shadow registers\n                and other external facing unguarded interfaces) allows an\n                attacker to bypass existing protections to the asset that are\n\t\tonly performed against the primary path.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. However, classification research is limited for weaknesses of this type, so there can be gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE that force use of this weakness, even at such a high level of abstraction.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
