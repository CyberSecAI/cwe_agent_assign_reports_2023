It is related to CWE-672 (Operation on Resource After Expiration or Release) as a child. CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) is a parent of CWE-324, but it's a class-level CWE. Selecting CWE-324 provides a more specific classification, aligning with best practices.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe324[\"CWE-324: Use of a Key Past its Expiration Date\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource After Expiration or Release\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    \n    cwe324 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe324 -->|PEEROF| cwe298\n    cwe324 -->|PEEROF| cwe324\n    cwe327 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe327 -->|PARENTOF| cwe324\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe324 primary\n    class cwe327 secondary\n    class cwe672 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a cryptographic key or password past its expiration date** (CWE-324), leading to a diminished safety margin and increasing the timing window for cracking attacks. The impact includes potential unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points to CWE-324 as the primary weakness, supported by explicit evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary. The vulnerability description key phrases include \"**weakness: use cryptographic key or password past its expiration date**.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"**Root Cause:** The software uses a cryptographic key or password past its expiration date.\" and \"**Vulnerability:** Use of a key past its expiration date (CWE-324).\" The Retriever Results also lists CWE-324 as the top result.\n\nCWE-327 was also considered as the use of expired keys can be considered risky, but the description focuses on the fact that the key expired not that the algorithm itself is broken or risky.\n\nThe selected CWE, CWE-324, is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: using a key past its expiration date. This aligns with MITRE's guidance to prefer base-level CWEs when they accurately represent the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* While related to credentials, this CWE is more about the strength of credentials, not their expiration.\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* The vulnerability is not about storing the key in cleartext, but about using it past its expiration date.\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* While using an expired key might increase risk, the core issue isn't the implementation of the cryptographic primitive itself.\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* The vulnerability is not about the key being hard-coded, but about it being used past its expiration date.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* The vulnerability is not about transmitting the key in cleartext.\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is about the hashing algorithm, not about key expiration.\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is about the hashing algorithm, not about key expiration.\n\n## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTwo separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* While using an expired key might lead to timing discrepancies, it's not the primary weakness.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* This is about data authenticity, not key expiration.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0",
