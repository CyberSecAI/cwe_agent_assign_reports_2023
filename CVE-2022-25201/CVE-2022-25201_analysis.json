This hierarchical relationship indicates that CWE-862 is a more specific case of a general authorization problem. The chain relationship isn't explicitly stated, but a missing authorization check often **CanPrecede** sensitive information exposure or privilege escalation. CWE-668 **Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere** and CWE-522 **Insufficiently Protected Credentials** are considered as secondary CWEs due to the impact of the vulnerability, which leads to exposure of credentials.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe862 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe668\n    cwe862 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe522\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe668,cwe522 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission checks** (CWE-862), which allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified webserver using attacker-specified credentials IDs. This ultimately leads to capturing credentials stored in Jenkins, which could be considered **Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere** (CWE-668) and involves **Insufficiently Protected Credentials** (CWE-522).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points to CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** as the primary weakness, supported by the key phrase \"**missing permission checks**\" and the CVE reference link content summary indicating that \"The Checkmarx Plugin **does not perform permission checks** in several HTTP endpoints.\" This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-862: \"The product **does not perform an authorization check** when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\"\n\nThe secondary candidates, CWE-668 **Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere** and CWE-522 **Insufficiently Protected Credentials**, capture the impact of the missing authorization, where credentials are being exposed to unauthorized actors and the credentials themselves are not sufficiently protected.\n\nThe relationship graph highlights the hierarchical structure with CWE-862 being a specific type of improper access control. This specificity, along with the direct evidence of missing permission checks, justifies the selection of CWE-862 as the primary CWE.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-862 is a Class-level CWE, and while it recommends examining children for a better fit, none of its children are more applicable given the provided information. The focus is on the missing check itself, rather than a specific type of authorization failure. The retriever results also support CWE-862 as the top candidate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
