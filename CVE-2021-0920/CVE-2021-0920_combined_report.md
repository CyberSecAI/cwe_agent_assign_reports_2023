## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with CWE-362, a **race condition** due to **improper synchronization**, which then leads to CWE-416, a **use-after-free** vulnerability. The final impact is local escalation of privilege.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability is a **use-after-free** caused by a **race condition** in the local sockets (AF_UNIX) subsystem of the Linux kernel. The **race condition** occurs during garbage collection when a socket might gain an external reference. The fix involves a lock barrier to prevent concurrent access and modifications during garbage collection.

The primary CWE is CWE-416 Use After Free, which is a Variant level CWE. The root cause is a race condition, CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'), which is a Class level CWE. CWE-362 can precede CWE-416.

The evidence is strong, with explicit mentions of the **race condition** and **use-after-free** in the vulnerability description, key phrases, and CVE reference links content summary. The provided information clearly indicates that a **race condition** leads to memory being accessed after it has been freed. The vulnerability description key phrases lists the weakness as "**use after free**" and the rootcause as "**race condition**". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states, "A **race condition** exists in the local sockets (AF_UNIX) subsystem of the Linux kernel...leading to a **use-after-free** vulnerability".

I considered other CWEs, but these were not a good fit:
* CWE-667: Improper Locking - While locking issues are related to race conditions, the core issue is the race condition itself.
* CWE-415: Double Free - The vulnerability description does not indicate that memory is being freed twice.
* CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition - This is not specific to a signal handler.
* CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource - This does not apply as the resource is freed, not uninitialized.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-0920

## Vulnerability Description
In unix_scm_to_skb of af_unix.c, there is a possible **use after free** bug due to a **race condition**. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-196926917References: Upstream kernel

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **race condition**
- **weakness:** **use after free**
- **impact:** local escalation of privilege
- **product:** Android kernel
- **component:** unix_scm_to_skb of af_unix.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0920:

**Root Cause:**
- A race condition exists in the local sockets (AF_UNIX) subsystem of the Linux kernel. Specifically, the issue arises during garbage collection while a socket might gain an external reference, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The race condition can lead to a use-after-free scenario, where memory is accessed after it has been freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting the vulnerability can lead to memory corruption or a system crash, causing a denial of service.
- **Privilege Escalation:** There's a possibility that the use-after-free could be leveraged for privilege escalation, potentially allowing a local user to gain higher privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** A local user is required to trigger this vulnerability.
- **AF_UNIX Sockets:** The vulnerability resides within the local sockets subsystem, specifically when using AF_UNIX sockets.
- **Race Condition:** Exploitation relies on triggering the race condition, which might require specific timing or sequence of operations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to interact with AF_UNIX sockets.
- No special privileges are explicitly required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details from Patches:**

The provided commit log (from `android.googlesource.com_a11aaad4_20250108_145330.html`) gives additional technical details regarding the fix.

- **Problem**: `unix_gc()` assumed that sockets wouldn't gain external references while the `unix_gc_lock` was held, except during `MSG_PEEK`. However, `MSG_PEEK` doesn't touch variables protected by `unix_gc_lock`, but it still needed to be serialized with garbage collection.
- **Solution**: Locking/unlocking the `unix_gc_lock` around the following operations
    1. Incrementing file count.
    2. Lock/unlock barrier to ensure the incremented file count is visible to garbage collection.
    3. Installing the file into the file descriptor.
- **Purpose**: The lock barrier ensures that garbage collection is either completely run before or after the barrier. This prevents the use-after-free condition.

**Additional Notes:**

- The Android Security Bulletin mentions that CVE-2021-0920 may be under limited, targeted exploitation.
- The fix involves a lock barrier to prevent concurrent access and modifications during garbage collection.

This analysis provides more details than the initial CVE description which states: "A race condition was discovered in the local sockets (AF_UNIX) subsystem, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or crash), or possibly for privilege escalation."

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

### Extended Description


A race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.


A race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:


  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.

  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.

A race condition exists when an "interfering code sequence" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.

The interfering code sequence could be "trusted" or "untrusted." A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed. They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.

**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.

**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.

**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

### Extended Description


Locking is a type of synchronization behavior that ensures that multiple independently-operating processes or threads do not interfere with each other when accessing the same resource. All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.

## CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not lock or does not correctly lock a resource when the product must have exclusive access to the resource.

### Extended Description
When a resource is not properly locked, an attacker could modify the resource while it is being operated on by the product. This might violate the product's assumption that the resource will not change, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors.

### Alternative Terms

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-20141:** Chain: an operating system kernel has insufficent resource locking (CWE-413) leading to a use after free (CWE-416).




## CWE-665: Improper Initialization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.

### Extended Description
This can have security implications when the associated resource is expected to have certain properties or values, such as a variable that determines whether a user has been authenticated or not.

### Alternative Terms

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-1471:** chain: an invalid value prevents a library file from being included, skipping initialization of key variables, leading to resultant eval injection.
- **CVE-2008-3637:** Improper error checking in protection mechanism produces an uninitialized variable, allowing security bypass and code execution.
- **CVE-2008-4197:** Use of uninitialized memory may allow code execution.




## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.

### Extended Description


Synchronization refers to a variety of behaviors and mechanisms that allow two or more independently-operating processes or threads to ensure that they operate on shared resources in predictable ways that do not interfere with each other. Some shared resource operations cannot be executed atomically; that is, multiple steps must be guaranteed to execute sequentially, without any interference by other processes. Synchronization mechanisms vary widely, but they may include locking, mutexes, and semaphores. When a multi-step operation on a shared resource cannot be guaranteed to execute independent of interference, then the resulting behavior can be unpredictable. Improper synchronization could lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.

## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not initialize a critical resource.

### Extended Description

## CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition.

### Extended Description


Race conditions frequently occur in signal handlers, since signal handlers support asynchronous actions. These race conditions have a variety of root causes and symptoms. Attackers may be able to exploit a signal handler race condition to cause the product state to be corrupted, possibly leading to a denial of service or even code execution.


These issues occur when non-reentrant functions, or state-sensitive actions occur in the signal handler, where they may be called at any time. These behaviors can violate assumptions being made by the "regular" code that is interrupted, or by other signal handlers that may also be invoked. If these functions are called at an inopportune moment - such as while a non-reentrant function is already running - memory corruption could occur that may be exploitable for code execution. Another signal race condition commonly found occurs when free is called within a signal handler, resulting in a double free and therefore a write-what-where condition. Even if a given pointer is set to NULL after it has been freed, a race condition still exists between the time the memory was freed and the pointer was set to NULL. This is especially problematic if the same signal handler has been set for more than one signal -- since it means that the signal handler itself may be reentered.


There are several known behaviors related to signal handlers that have received the label of "signal handler race condition":


  - Shared state (e.g. global data or static variables) that are accessible to both a signal handler and "regular" code

  - Shared state between a signal handler and other signal handlers

  - Use of non-reentrant functionality within a signal handler - which generally implies that shared state is being used. For example, malloc() and free() are non-reentrant because they may use global or static data structures for managing memory, and they are indirectly used by innocent-seeming functions such as syslog(); these functions could be exploited for memory corruption and, possibly, code execution.

  - Association of the same signal handler function with multiple signals - which might imply shared state, since the same code and resources are accessed. For example, this can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.

  - Use of setjmp and longjmp, or other mechanisms that prevent a signal handler from returning control back to the original functionality

  - While not technically a race condition, some signal handlers are designed to be called at most once, and being called more than once can introduce security problems, even when there are not any concurrent calls to the signal handler. This can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.

Signal handler vulnerabilities are often classified based on the absence of a specific protection mechanism, although this style of classification is discouraged in CWE because programmers often have a choice of several different mechanisms for addressing the weakness. Such protection mechanisms may preserve exclusivity of access to the shared resource, and behavioral atomicity for the relevant code:

  - Avoiding shared state

  - Using synchronization in the signal handler

  - Using synchronization in the regular code

  - Disabling or masking other signals, which provides atomicity (which effectively ensures exclusivity)

## CWE-415: Double Free
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.

### Extended Description
When a program calls free() twice with the same argument, the program's memory management data structures become corrupted. This corruption can cause the program to crash or, in some circumstances, cause two later calls to malloc() to return the same pointer. If malloc() returns the same value twice and the program later gives the attacker control over the data that is written into this doubly-allocated memory, the program becomes vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.

**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is usually resultant from another weakness, such as an unhandled error or race condition between threads. It could also be primary to weaknesses such as buffer overflows.

**[Theoretical]** It could be argued that Double Free would be most appropriately located as a child of "Use after Free", but "Use" and "Release" are considered to be distinct operations within vulnerability theory, therefore this is more accurately "Release of a Resource after Expiration or Release", which doesn't exist yet.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2006-5051:** Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).
- **CVE-2004-0642:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.
- **CVE-2004-0772:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.




## CWE-416: Use After Free
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory "belongs" to the code that operates on the new pointer.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-20141:** Chain: an operating system kernel has insufficent resource locking (CWE-413) leading to a use after free (CWE-416).
- **CVE-2022-2621:** Chain: two threads in a web browser use the same resource (CWE-366), but one of those threads can destroy the resource before the other has completed (CWE-416).
- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
