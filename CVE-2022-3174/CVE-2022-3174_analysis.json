CWE-614 provides a more specific classification, focusing on the missing 'Secure' attribute for cookies in HTTPS sessions, while CWE-319 is a broader category encompassing any cleartext transmission of sensitive information. Given the specific details in the vulnerability description and CVE details, the variant CWE-614 is a better fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe614[\"CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe614 -->|CHILDOF| cwe319\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe614 primary\n    class cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing secure attribute** on a sensitive cookie in an HTTPS session (CWE-614).\n2.  **Weakness:** The cookie can be transmitted in cleartext over HTTP.\n3.  **Impact:** Potential for session hijacking if the cookie is intercepted.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered the primary CWE match suggestion of CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) from similar CVE descriptions. However, the provided CVE details and the retriever results pointed to CWE-614 (Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute) as a more precise match.\n\nThe vulnerability description key phrases highlight the **missing secure attribute** as the root cause. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the vulnerability stems from the lack of the `Secure` attribute on session cookies when an HTTPS connection is used, which can lead to the cookie being transmitted over an insecure HTTP connection.\n\nCWE-614 is a Variant-level CWE that directly addresses the specific issue of a missing 'Secure' attribute on sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions. The MITRE mapping guidance allows for the use of Variant-level CWEs when they accurately represent the weakness. Therefore, CWE-614 is chosen as the primary CWE.\n\nCWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is considered as a secondary CWE because it represents the broader issue of transmitting sensitive information in cleartext. While CWE-614 is more specific to the cookie issue, the cleartext transmission aspect is also relevant.\n\nCWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) was considered but not chosen as the primary CWE because it is a Class-level CWE and is too broad. The vulnerability is not about the absence of encryption in general but about a specific attribute on a cookie.\n\nBased on the available evidence, the selection of CWE-614 as the primary CWE is justified due to its specificity and alignment with the vulnerability details. CWE-319 is a secondary candidate that encompasses a weakness that followed.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions is not set, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-319\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
