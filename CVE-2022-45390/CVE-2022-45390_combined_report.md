## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship impacting the decision is the parent-child relationship between CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). CWE-862 is a more specific child of CWE-285, making it a better fit when authorization is completely missing. The retriever results also highlighted CWE-862 as the top candidate. Other relationships, such as those involving authentication (CWE-306) or credential storage (CWE-256, CWE-522), were considered but deemed less relevant as the core issue is the absence of an authorization check.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is straightforward:
1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing permission check** (CWE-862) on an HTTP endpoint.
2.  **Impact:** Attackers with Overall/Read permission can enumerate the IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description and the retriever results, strongly suggests CWE-862 as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description key phrases highlight the "**missing permission check**" as the root cause, aligning perfectly with CWE-862's definition. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms that the loader.io Plugin **does not perform a permission check** in an HTTP endpoint, further solidifying the selection of CWE-862.

The graph relationships, particularly the parent-child relationship between CWE-285 and CWE-862, were also considered. While CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) could be a potential candidate, CWE-862 is more specific because the authorization check is entirely missing, not just incorrectly implemented.

The selection of CWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **missing permission check** that allows attackers to enumerate credentials IDs. This is a clear and concise representation of the vulnerability's root cause.

## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review

*Reason for not selecting*: This CWE is too broad and doesn't directly relate to the **missing authorization** vulnerability.

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed

*Reason for not selecting*: The vulnerability is not about placing sensitive information in accessible locations, but about the **lack of authorization** to access the information in the first place.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed

*Reason for not selecting*: This vulnerability is not about relying on untrusted inputs but about the **absence of an authorization check**.

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review

*Reason for not selecting*: The problem is not with authentication, but with the **missing authorization check** after a user is authenticated.

## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed

*Reason for not selecting*: This CWE is about observable discrepancies, not about the **missing permission check**.

## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed

*Reason for not selecting*: The issue isn't that the files are directly accessible, but that an HTTP endpoint that exposes information about those files lacks proper authorization checks.

## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class

The current organization is based primarily on the exposure of sensitive information as a consequence, instead of as a primary weakness.

**[Maintenance]** There is a close relationship with CWE-552, which is more focused on weaknesses. As a result, it may be more appropriate to convert CWE-538 to a category.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2018-1999036:** SSH password for private key stored in build log




## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description


Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.


When access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.


### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information
- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.
- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.




## CWE-927: Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The Android application uses an implicit intent for transmitting sensitive data to other applications.

### Extended Description


Since an implicit intent does not specify a particular application to receive the data, any application can process the intent by using an Intent Filter for that intent. This can allow untrusted applications to obtain sensitive data. There are two variations on the standard broadcast intent, ordered and sticky.


Ordered broadcast intents are delivered to a series of registered receivers in order of priority as declared by the Receivers. A malicious receiver can give itself a high priority and cause a denial of service by stopping the broadcast from propagating further down the chain. There is also the possibility of malicious data modification, as a receiver may also alter the data within the Intent before passing it on to the next receiver. The downstream components have no way of asserting that the data has not been altered earlier in the chain.


Sticky broadcast intents remain accessible after the initial broadcast. An old sticky intent will be broadcast again to any new receivers that register for it in the future, greatly increasing the chances of information exposure over time. Also, sticky broadcasts cannot be protected by permissions that may apply to other kinds of intents.


In addition, any broadcast intent may include a URI that references data that the receiving component does not normally have the privileges to access. The sender of the intent can include special privileges that grant the receiver read or write access to the specific URI included in the intent. A malicious receiver that intercepts this intent will also gain those privileges and be able to read or write the resource at the specified URI.
