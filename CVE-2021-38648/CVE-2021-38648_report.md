# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.81
**Source**: dense
**Description**: The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed

## CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense
**Description**: The product communicates with a host that provides a certificate, but the product does not properly ensure that the certificate is actually associated with that host.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense
**Description**: The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed

## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense
**Description**: The product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed

## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense
**Description**: The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense
**Description**: The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged

## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense
**Description**: The product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged

## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense
**Description**: The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed

## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense
**Description**: The product violates well-established principles for secure design.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged

## CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense
**Description**: The product receives a complex input with multiple elements or fields that must be consistent with each other, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually consistent.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed

## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 5517.31
**Source**: sparse
**Description**: The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed

## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 5459.17
**Source**: sparse
**Description**: The product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.

## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 5401.67
**Source**: sparse
**Description**: The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed

## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 5367.29
**Source**: sparse
**Description**: The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed

## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction Level**: Base
