CWE-113 is more specific, focusing on CRLF injection in HTTP headers. CWE-20 is a Class-level CWE and is too general. The relationship shows that insufficient input validation (CWE-20) can lead to HTTP Response Splitting (CWE-113).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe113 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20), which then leads to **HTTP header injection** and specifically **Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers** (CWE-113). The impact of this is cross-site scripting, cache poisoning, and session hijacking.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **improper input validation** as the root cause leading to **HTTP header injection**. The provided evidence, particularly the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\", confirms this.\n\nThe selection of CWE-113 as the primary CWE is based on its specificity and the vulnerability description, which mentions \"HOST headers\". While CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is also relevant as a contributing factor, it is too general and therefore considered a secondary CWE.\n\nThe retriever results also point towards CWE-113 as a candidate, along with the relationship data showing that CWE-113 is a child of CWE-20.\n\nThe evidence supporting CWE-113 is that the IBM Sterling Secure Proxy 6.0.3 is vulnerable to **HTTP header injection**, caused by **improper validation of input** by the HOST headers which matches the description of CWE-113: \"The product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\"\n\nThe official MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-113 indicates that its usage is ALLOWED.\n\nThe decision to include CWE-20 is based on the **improper input validation**, however, the MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-20 is DISCOURAGED. It is only included as a secondary factor.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-162: Improper Neutralization of Trailing Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an

Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a

framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the

component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-150: Improper Neutralization of Escape, Meta, or Control Sequences\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize

abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
