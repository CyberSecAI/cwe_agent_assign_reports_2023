# Analysis for CVE-2022-26653

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-425 | Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is the ChildOf relationship. CWE-425 is a child of CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel). While CWE-862 could be a candidate, CWE-425 is more specific as it relates to direct requests. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a Class-level CWE, making CWE-425 a better fit as a Base-level CWE.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient authorization** on the `/dcapi/` endpoint, which leads to a guest user being able to make a **direct request** to access sensitive domain details. This results in **information disclosure**.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified **CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')** as the primary CWE. The vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary both point towards a direct request to an API endpoint without proper authorization.

The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states:
*   "The root cause is an **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)** vulnerability in ManageEngine Remote Access Plus. Specifically, a "Guest" user can directly access an API endpoint `/dcapi/` without proper authorization checks, which is intended for administrators."
*   "**Insufficient Authorization:** The primary weakness is that the application does not properly restrict access to the `/dcapi/` endpoint. Guest users, who are not meant to access administrative details, can make direct requests to this endpoint."
*   "**Direct API Request:** An attacker, authenticated as a guest user, can make a direct HTTP request to the `/dcapi/` API endpoint."

The "Retriever Results" lists CWE-425 as the top candidate with a score of 0.074. The description of CWE-425, "The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files," aligns well with the vulnerability. The mapping guidance for CWE-425 states "This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities."

CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization was considered as a secondary CWE because there is an authorization check but it is not correctly implemented.

The final selection of CWE-425 is based on the evidence of direct request without proper authorization, aligning with the base-level abstraction for root cause analysis.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs authentication based on the name of a resource being accessed, or the name of the actor performing the access, but it does not properly check all possible names for that resource or actor.

- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
