It is a child of CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). The relationship to CWE-306 is relevant because the vulnerability involves a lack of authentication for certain paths or channels. CWE-420 (Unprotected Alternate Channel) is a peer, indicating a related but distinct weakness where an alternate channel lacks protection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe420[\"CWE-420: Unprotected Alternate Channel\"]\n\n    cwe288 -->|CHILDOF| cwe306\n    cwe288 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe288 --|PEEROF| cwe420\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe288 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe284,cwe420 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** of an **authentication bypass using an alternate path or channel** (CWE-288). This leads to the impact of an unauthenticated attacker being able to perform operations on the administrative interface.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel), with a confidence score of 1. This is directly supported by the vulnerability description, which explicitly states \"An **authentication bypass using an alternate path or channel**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms this: \"root_cause\": \"An **authentication bypass using an alternate path or channel** vulnerability.\"\n\nCWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) was considered as a secondary candidate, since CWE-288 is a child of CWE-306, and addresses a more general case of missing authentication. However, CWE-288 is more specific, as the vulnerability is not just missing authentication, but missing authentication on an alternate path or channel.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly reflects the **weakness** described in the vulnerability report. The relationship analysis helped to confirm that the chosen CWE is appropriate and not overly general.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
