# Analysis for CVE-2022-40306

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-405 | Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification) | 0.9 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE: The vulnerability allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DoS) by requesting the login form repeatedly, which triggers expensive RSA key-generation operations. This is a clear case of asymmetric resource consumption, as the attacker's effort (sending requests) is significantly less than the server's effort (generating RSA keys). |
| CWE-799 | Improper Control of Interaction Frequency | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary CWE: The application does not properly limit the number of requests to the login form, which exacerbates the resource consumption issue. |
| CWE-330 | Use of Insufficiently Random Values | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE: RSA key generation relies on random number generation. The description mentions "expensive RSA key-generation operations". If a weak or predictable random number generator is used, it can further amplify the problem. |

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **expensive RSA key-generation operations** being performed on every request to the login form. This leads to **Asymmetric Resource Consumption**, where the attacker's minimal effort results in significant server-side resource usage. Finally, this culminates in a **Denial of Service (DoS)**.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on the **expensive RSA key-generation operations** which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DoS) by requesting that form repeatedly.
The CWE-405 was selected as the primary weakness because it directly addresses the asymmetric nature of the resource consumption. The attacker initiates an action that requires much more computation on the server side.
CWE-799 was considered because the vulnerability is caused by the fact that the server does not limit the number of requests to the login form. This allows the attacker to repeatedly trigger the expensive RSA key-generation operations, leading to a denial of service. This contributes to the Asymmetric Resource Consumption (CWE-405).
CWE-330 was also considered because the weakness description mentions that the server generates RSA key pairs. RSA key generation relies on random number generation. If a weak or predictable random number generator is used, it can further amplify the problem.

The final selection of CWE-405, CWE-799, and CWE-330 provides a comprehensive view of the vulnerability. The CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity, providing a clear understanding of the root cause and contributing factors.
The selection is based on the vulnerability description, the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, and the Retriever Results. The relationship analysis further supports the selection of these CWEs.

## Vulnerability Description
The login form /Login in ECi Printanista Hub (formerly FMAudit Printscout) through 2022-06-27 performs **expensive RSA key-generation operations**, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DoS) by requesting that form repeatedly.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **expensive RSA key-generation operations**
- **impact:** denial of service (DoS)
- **vector:** requesting that form repeatedly
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** ECi Printanista Hub (formerly FMAudit Printscout)
- **version:** through 2022-06-27
- **component:** /Login

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-40306:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Printanista Hub web application generates a new RSA private/public key pair every time the login form is rendered. This key is used to encrypt the password before sending it to the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Asymmetric Resource Consumption:** The generation of RSA key pairs, especially the prime numbers, is computationally expensive.
*   **Lack of Public Key Validation:** The application does not validate the public key, making it prone to man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Unnecessary Encryption:** The RSA encryption on top of TLS is considered redundant and mostly useless.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can send multiple HTTP requests to the login page, forcing the server to repeatedly generate RSA key pairs. This exhausts server resources, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests to the Login Page:** An attacker sends multiple HTTP requests to the login page to trigger the expensive key generation process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Printanista Hub web server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is triggered simply by accessing the login page, so no prior authentication is needed.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was discovered in 2020-07-13 and reported to the vendor on 2022-06-27.
*   The vendor has not released a solution as of the advisory.
*   The suggested mitigation is to remove the redundant RSA encryption completely and rely on well-configured TLS.
*   The release notes from Printanista mention "Removed custom login encryption to address CVE-2022-40306" in version 5.5.2, confirming a fix for the issue.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.

### Extended Description
This can allow the actor to perform actions more frequently than expected. The actor could be a human or an automated process such as a virus or bot. This could be used to cause a denial of service, compromise program logic (such as limiting humans to a single vote), or other consequences. For example, an authentication routine might not limit the number of times an attacker can guess a password. Or, a web site might conduct a poll but only expect humans to vote a maximum of once a day.

### Alternative Terms
Insufficient anti-automation: The term "insufficient anti-automation" focuses primarly on non-human actors such as viruses or bots, but the scope of this CWE entry is broader.
Brute force: Vulnerabilities that can be targeted using brute force attacks are often symptomatic of this weakness.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-1876:** Mail server allows attackers to prevent other users from accessing mail by sending large number of rapid requests.




## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

### Extended Description
In security-relevant contexts, even small variations in timing can be exploited by attackers to indirectly infer certain details about the product's internal operations. For example, in some cryptographic algorithms, attackers can use timing differences to infer certain properties about a private key, making the key easier to guess. Timing discrepancies effectively form a timing side channel.

- **CVE-2014-0984:** Password-checking function in router terminates validation of a password entry when it encounters the first incorrect character, which allows remote attackers to obtain passwords via a brute-force attack that relies on timing differences in responses to incorrect password guesses, aka a timing side-channel attack.




## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

### Extended Description
Discrepancies can take many forms, and variations may be detectable in timing, control flow, communications such as replies or requests, or general behavior. These discrepancies can reveal information about the product's operation or internal state to an unauthorized actor. In some cases, discrepancies can be used by attackers to form a side channel.

### Alternative Terms
Side Channel Attack: Observable Discrepancies are at the root of side channel attacks.

## CWE-335: Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) but does not correctly manage seeds.

### Extended Description


 PRNGs are deterministic and, while their output appears random, they cannot actually create entropy. They rely on cryptographically secure and unique seeds for entropy so proper seeding is critical to the secure operation of the PRNG.


 Management of seeds could be broken down into two main areas: 


  -  (1) protecting seeds as cryptographic material (such as a cryptographic key); 

  -  (2) whenever possible, using a uniquely generated seed from a cryptographically secure source 

 PRNGs require a seed as input to generate a stream of numbers that are functionally indistinguishable from random numbers. While the output is, in many cases, sufficient for cryptographic uses, the output of any PRNG is directly determined by the seed provided as input. If the seed can be ascertained by a third party, the entire output of the PRNG can be made known to them. As such, the seed should be kept secret and should ideally not be able to be guessed. For example, the current time may be a poor seed. Knowing the approximate time the PRNG was seeded greatly reduces the possible key space. 

 Seeds do not necessarily need to be unique, but reusing seeds may open up attacks if the seed is discovered.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, "randomness" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-7010:** Cloud application on Kubernetes generates passwords using a weak random number generator based on deployment time.
- **CVE-2019-11495:** server uses erlang:now() to seed the PRNG, which results in a small search space for potential random seeds
- **CVE-2018-12520:** Product's PRNG is not seeded for the generation of session IDs

- **CVE-2001-1291:** Product does not disconnect or timeout after multiple failed logins.




## CWE-385: Covert Timing Channel
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Covert timing channels convey information by modulating some aspect of system behavior over time, so that the program receiving the information can observe system behavior and infer protected information.

### Extended Description


In some instances, knowing when data is transmitted between parties can provide a malicious user with privileged information. Also, externally monitoring the timing of operations can potentially reveal sensitive data. For example, a cryptographic operation can expose its internal state if the time it takes to perform the operation varies, based on the state.


Covert channels are frequently classified as either storage or timing channels. Some examples of covert timing channels are the system's paging rate, the time a certain transaction requires to execute, and the time it takes to gain access to a shared bus.

- **CVE-2003-1564:** Parsing library allows XML bomb
- **CVE-2004-2458:** Tool creates directories before authenticating user.




## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).

### Extended Description


A hash function is defined as an algorithm that maps arbitrarily sized data into a fixed-sized digest (output) such that the following properties hold:


  1. The algorithm is not invertible (also called "one-way" or "not reversible")

  1. The algorithm is deterministic; the same input produces the same digest every time

 Building on this definition, a cryptographic hash function must also ensure that a malicious actor cannot leverage the hash function to have a reasonable chance of success at determining any of the following:

  1. the original input (preimage attack), given only the digest

  1. another input that can produce the same digest (2nd preimage attack), given the original input

  1. a set of two or more inputs that evaluate to the same digest (birthday attack), given the actor can arbitrarily choose the inputs to be hashed and can do so a reasonable amount of times

What is regarded as "reasonable" varies by context and threat model, but in general, "reasonable" could cover any attack that is more efficient than brute force (i.e., on average, attempting half of all possible combinations). Note that some attacks might be more efficient than brute force but are still not regarded as achievable in the real world.

Any algorithm that does not meet the above conditions will generally be considered weak for general use in hashing.


In addition to algorithmic weaknesses, a hash function can be made weak by using the hash in a security context that breaks its security guarantees. For example, using a hash function without a salt for storing passwords (that are sufficiently short) could enable an adversary to create a "rainbow table" [REF-637] to recover the password under certain conditions; this attack works against such hash functions as MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2.

**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries including CWE-328 have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30320:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.
- **CVE-2005-4900:** SHA-1 algorithm is not collision-resistant.
- **CVE-2020-25685:** DNS product uses a weak hash (CRC32 or SHA-1) of the query name, allowing attacker to forge responses by computing domain names with the same hash.
