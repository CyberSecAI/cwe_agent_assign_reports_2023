CWE-1220 is a more specific instance of CWE-284, providing better granularity. Although CWE-284 is listed as a discouraged CWE, the evidence points directly to an access control issue, making it a relevant, albeit less specific, classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1220[\"CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe1220 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1220 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is fairly straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause**: **Improper access control**, specifically **insufficient granularity** (CWE-1220)\n2.  **Impact**: Potential denial of service (DoS)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **improper access control**, which is the stated **rootcause** of the vulnerability. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this by stating the \"**root cause of vulnerability** is **improper access control** in the firmware\" and the \"**core issue is a lack of proper access control**\". The primary CWE match from the \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section being CWE-NVD-noinfo suggests the need for careful consideration of the available evidence to select a more descriptive CWE.\n\nThe \"Retriever Results\" highlight several potential CWEs, including CWE-691, CWE-248, CWE-693, CWE-284, CWE-119, CWE-1191, CWE-1257, CWE-453, CWE-287 and CWE-1220. After careful review, CWE-1220 and CWE-284 emerged as the most relevant.\n\nCWE-284 is a high-level **Improper Access Control** (Pillar) that is discouraged because it is too generic. However, it is relevant as a general category.\n\nCWE-1220 **Insufficient Granularity of Access Control** (Base) is a more specific child of CWE-284. The description of CWE-1220 directly aligns with the vulnerability, where access controls are implemented but lack the necessary granularity, allowing unauthorized access.\n\nTherefore, CWE-1220 is the optimal choice as the primary CWE, representing the **root cause** with sufficient specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-284: Improper Access Control\n**Abstraction:** Pillar\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.",
