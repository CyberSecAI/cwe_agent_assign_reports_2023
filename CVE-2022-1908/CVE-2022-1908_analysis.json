CWE-823, Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset, can precede CWE-125, showing a possible chain where an incorrect pointer offset leads to an out-of-bounds read. The selection of CWE-125 as the primary CWE is because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions an **out-of-bounds read**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    cwe823[\"CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset\"]\n    \n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe125\n    cwe823 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe125\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe126,cwe823 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper handling of self-closing tags**, which leads to **incorrect pointer arithmetic**, resulting in an **out-of-bounds read**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly pointed to CWE-125 due to the explicit mention of an **out-of-bounds read** in the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The retriever results also listed CWE-125 as a highly relevant CWE. The final decision was primarily influenced by the evidence from the vulnerability description itself, specifically the **weakness** being an **out-of-bounds read**, and the confirmation from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary detailing the root cause.
