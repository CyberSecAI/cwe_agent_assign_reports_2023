This hierarchy reflects the specific nature of the vulnerability, where excessive memory allocation due to a large size value leads to uncontrolled resource consumption. The selection of CWE-789 is preferred because it is at the Variant level of abstraction, providing a more precise characterization of the weakness compared to its parent classes.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe789 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **large response received by the viaduct WSClient**. The **weakness** is **memory exhaustion** because the entire response body is read into memory. The impact of this **memory exhaustion** is a denial of service (DoS).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) with a confidence score of 0.9. This selection is based on the following evidence:\n\n*   The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **memory exhaustion** due to a **large response received by the viaduct WSClient**. This aligns with CWE-789's description: \"The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\"\n*   The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause is the way the viaduct WSClient handles large responses, leading to **memory exhaustion**.\n*   CWE-789 is a Variant level CWE, which is preferred for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) was considered as a secondary CWE because it describes a more general case where resources are allocated without limits. While relevant, CWE-789 is more specific to the vulnerability, focusing on memory allocation with excessive size values.\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) was also considered but ultimately deemed too general. While the vulnerability does lead to resource consumption, the root cause is more accurately captured by the excessive memory allocation described in CWE-789. MITRE discourages the use of CWE-400 because it is often misused when more precise mappings are available.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause and contributing factors of the vulnerability, based on the provided evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**:

Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives a complex input with multiple elements or fields that must be consistent with each other, but it does not

Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is

Input for Loop Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly check inputs that are used for loop conditions, potentially leading to a denial of service or other consequences because of excessive looping.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading",
