Although the description of CWE-862 is a Class, it is the most specific and appropriate option given the evidence. The relationship between CWE-319 and CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) also influenced my decision. The vulnerability description mentions connecting to an attacker-specified web server using attacker-specified credentials, which *could* imply the transmission of credentials in cleartext. However, this is an assumption, and there is no explicit mention of cleartext transmission.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe319 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe311 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission check** (CWE-862) which allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified web server using attacker-specified credentials. If the connection is in cleartext, this could lead to **cleartext transmission of sensitive information** (CWE-319).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **missing permission check**. The primary CWE match from similar CVE descriptions is CWE-862, which aligns with the provided evidence. The retriever results also list CWE-862 as the top combined result.\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a **missing permission check** in the Jenkins SWAMP Plugin. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-862: \"The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms this: \"The SWAMP plugin does not perform a permission check in a method that implements form validation.\"\nThe possibility of **cleartext transmission of sensitive information** (CWE-319) was considered, but there is no explicit evidence for this in the vulnerability description or the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The vulnerability allows attackers to connect to an attacker-specified web server using attacker-specified credentials. If the connection to the attacker-specified server transmits the credentials in cleartext, CWE-319 would be applicable. Given that this is an assumption, I am including it as a secondary candidate with a lower confidence score.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-862 is more specific than its parent CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), and CWE-319 is a base level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
