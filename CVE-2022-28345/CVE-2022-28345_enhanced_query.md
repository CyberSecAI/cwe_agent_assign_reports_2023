# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-28345

## Vulnerability Description
The Signal app before 5.34 for iOS allows **URI spoofing** via RTLO injection. It **incorrectly renders RTLO encoded URLs** beginning with a non-breaking space, when there is a hash character in the URL. This technique allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to send legitimate looking links, appearing to be any website URL, by abusing the non-http/non-https automatic rendering of URLs. An attacker can spoof, for example, example.com, and masquerade any URL with a malicious destination. An attacker requires a subdomain such as gepj, txt, fdp, or xcod, which would appear backwards as jpeg, txt, pdf, and docx respectively.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **incorrectly renders RTLO encoded URLs**
- **weakness:** **URI spoofing**
- **impact:** send legitimate looking links
- **vector:** RTLO injection
- **attacker:** remote unauthenticated attacker
- **product:** Signal app
- **version:** before 5.34

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28345:

**1. Verification:**

The content explicitly mentions "CVE-2022-28345" and describes an "RTLO Injection URI Spoofing" vulnerability in the Signal iOS client, which aligns with the official CVE description (PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval).

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Signal iOS client's incorrect rendering of RTLO (Right-to-Left Override) encoded URLs. Specifically, the client fails to properly sanitize URLs that:
    *   Begin with a non-breaking space.
    *   Contain a hash (#) character.
    *   Lack the `http` or `https` scheme.

This allows an attacker to craft malicious URLs that, when rendered by the Signal client, display a completely different (and often legitimate-looking) URL to the user.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **RTLO Injection:** The core vulnerability is the misuse of the RTLO control character which causes a reversal in the display of text, this can be leveraged to create deceptive URLs.
*   **Inadequate URL Parsing/Sanitization:** The Signal iOS client doesn't properly parse and sanitize URLs containing RTLO characters and specific formatting (non-breaking space, # character and lack of schema) before rendering them, leading to a spoofed display of the URL.
*  **Bypass Previous Fixes:** The inclusion of the `#` character caused the Signal client to hyperlink the entire URL which bypasses previous fixes for similar vulnerabilities.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **URI Spoofing/Phishing:** Attackers can create links that appear to point to legitimate websites but actually direct users to malicious sites.
*   **Social Engineering Attacks:** The spoofed URLs can be used to trick users into divulging sensitive information, downloading malware, or performing other unwanted actions.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Messages:** The primary attack vector is through malicious messages sent via the Signal application.
*   **Any client:** The malicious messages can be sent via any other client that is able to send messages to Signal iOS clients.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not require any authentication to send the malicious messages.
*   **Ability to Send Messages:** The attacker only needs the ability to send messages to Signal users.
*   **Crafted URLs:** The attacker must be able to generate URLs using the specific RTLO character, non-breaking space, a `#` character and remove `http` or `https`.

**Additional Notes:**
* The exploit leverages the fact that the Signal client renders URLs beginning with a non-breaking space and a hash character automatically as hyperlinks and automatically uses the top level domain after the last forward slash for display purposes.
* The exploit only affects the iOS Signal client, but can be sent from any other client.
*  The vulnerability was fixed in Signal iOS client version 5.34.
* The exploit makes use of common top-level domains (TLD) such as .com to disguise the attack.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

### Extended Description
Software or other automated logic has certain assumptions about what constitutes data and control respectively. It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-707

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.
**Comments:** Examine the children and descendants of this entry to find a more precise mapping.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** Many people treat injection only as an input validation problem (CWE-20) because many people do not distinguish between the consequence/attack (injection) and the protection mechanism that prevents the attack from succeeding. However, input validation is only one potential protection mechanism (output encoding is another), and there is a chaining relationship between improper input validation and the improper enforcement of the structure of messages to other components. Other issues not directly related to input validation, such as race conditions, could similarly impact message structure.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-5184:** API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.
- **CVE-2022-36069:** Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.
- **CVE-1999-0067:** Canonical example of OS command injection. CGI program does not neutralize "|" metacharacter when invoking a phonebook program.




## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
XSPA: Cross Site Port Attack
SSRF: Server-Side Request Forgery

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-441
ChildOf -> CWE-610

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** CWE-918 (SSRF) and CWE-611 (XXE) are closely related, because they both involve web-related technologies and can launch outbound requests to unexpected destinations. However, XXE can be performed client-side, or in other contexts in which the software is not acting directly as a server, so the "Server" portion of the SSRF acronym does not necessarily apply.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-32786:** Chain: LLM integration framework has prompt injection (CWE-1427) that allows an attacker to force the service to retrieve data from an arbitrary URL, essentially providing SSRF (CWE-918) and potentially injecting content into downstream tasks.
- **CVE-2021-26855:** Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in mail server, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-21973:** Server Side Request Forgery in cloud platform, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. This is often a component in phishing attacks.

### Extended Description


If an attacker can cause the UI to display erroneous data, or to otherwise convince the user to display information that appears to come from a trusted source, then the attacker could trick the user into performing the wrong action. This is often a component in phishing attacks, but other kinds of problems exist. For example, if the UI is used to monitor the security state of a system or network, then omitting or obscuring an important indicator could prevent the user from detecting and reacting to a security-critical event.


UI misrepresentation can take many forms:


  - Incorrect indicator: incorrect information is displayed, which prevents the user from understanding the true state of the product or the environment the product is monitoring, especially of potentially-dangerous conditions or operations. This can be broken down into several different subtypes.

  - Overlay: an area of the display is intended to give critical information, but another process can modify the display by overlaying another element on top of it. The user is not interacting with the expected portion of the user interface. This is the problem that enables clickjacking attacks, although many other types of attacks exist that involve overlay.

  - Icon manipulation: the wrong icon, or the wrong color indicator, can be influenced (such as making a dangerous .EXE executable look like a harmless .GIF)

  - Timing: the product is performing a state transition or context switch that is presented to the user with an indicator, but a race condition can cause the wrong indicator to be used before the product has fully switched context. The race window could be extended indefinitely if the attacker can trigger an error.

  - Visual truncation: important information could be truncated from the display, such as a long filename with a dangerous extension that is not displayed in the GUI because the malicious portion is truncated. The use of excessive whitespace can also cause truncation, or place the potentially-dangerous indicator outside of the user's field of view (e.g. "filename.txt .exe"). A different type of truncation can occur when a portion of the information is removed due to reasons other than length, such as the accidental insertion of an end-of-input marker in the middle of an input, such as a NUL byte in a C-style string.

  - Visual distinction: visual information might be presented in a way that makes it difficult for the user to quickly and correctly distinguish between critical and unimportant segments of the display.

  - Homographs: letters from different character sets, fonts, or languages can appear very similar (i.e. may be visually equivalent) in a way that causes the human user to misread the text (for example, to conduct phishing attacks to trick a user into visiting a malicious web site with a visually-similar name as a trusted site). This can be regarded as a type of visual distinction issue.

- **CVE-2001-0398:** Attachment with many spaces in filename bypasses "dangerous content" warning and uses different icon. Likely resultant.
- **CVE-2001-0643:** Misrepresentation and equivalence issue.




## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.

### Extended Description
When a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by interfering in the communication path between the host and client. The product might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the product might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host.

- **CVE-2014-1266:** chain: incorrect "goto" in Apple SSL product bypasses certificate validation, allowing Adversary-in-the-Middle (AITM) attack (Apple "goto fail" bug). CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).
- **CVE-2021-22909:** Chain: router's firmware update procedure uses curl with "-k" (insecure) option that disables certificate validation (CWE-295), allowing adversary-in-the-middle (AITM) compromise with a malicious firmware image (CWE-494).




## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component
in another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the
intended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.

### Extended Description


When creating commands using interpolation into a string, developers may assume that only the arguments/options that they specify will be processed. This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** At one layer of abstraction, this can overlap other weaknesses that have whitespace problems, e.g. injection of javascript into attributes of HTML tags.



### Observed Examples

- **CVE-2001-0150:** Web browser executes Telnet sessions using command line arguments that are specified by the web site, which could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.




## CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product acts as an intermediary HTTP agent
         (such as a proxy or firewall) in the data flow between two
         entities such as a client and server, but it does not
         interpret malformed HTTP requests or responses in ways that
         are consistent with how the messages will be processed by
         those entities that are at the ultimate destination.

### Extended Description


HTTP requests or responses ("messages") can be malformed or unexpected in ways that cause web servers or clients to interpret the messages in different ways than intermediary HTTP agents such as load balancers, reverse proxies, web caching proxies, application firewalls, etc. For example, an adversary may be able to add duplicate or different header fields that a client or server might interpret as one set of messages, whereas the intermediary might interpret the same sequence of bytes as a different set of messages. For example, discrepancies can arise in how to handle duplicate headers like two Transfer-encoding (TE) or two Content-length (CL), or the malicious HTTP message will have different headers for TE and CL.


The inconsistent parsing and interpretation of messages can allow the adversary to "smuggle" a message to the client/server without the intermediary being aware of it.


This weakness is usually the result of the usage of outdated or incompatible HTTP protocol versions in the HTTP agents.

**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** Request smuggling can be performed due to a multiple interpretation error, where the target is an intermediary or monitor, via a consistency manipulation (Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length headers).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24766:** SSL/TLS-capable proxy allows HTTP smuggling when used in tandem with HTTP/1.0 services, due to inconsistent interpretation and input sanitization of HTTP messages within the body of another message
- **CVE-2021-37147:** Chain: caching proxy server has improper input validation (CWE-20) of headers, allowing HTTP response smuggling (CWE-444) using an "LF line ending"
- **CVE-2020-8287:** Node.js platform allows request smuggling via two Transfer-Encoding headers




## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

### Extended Description


Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:


  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.

  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.

  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.

  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.

  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.

  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.

There are three main kinds of XSS:

  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.

  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. 

  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. 

Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as "drive-by hacking."

In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.


### Alternative Terms
XSS: A common abbreviation for Cross-Site Scripting.
HTML Injection: Used as a synonym of stored (Type 2) XSS.
CSS: In the early years after initial discovery of XSS, "CSS" was a commonly-used acronym. However, this would cause confusion with "Cascading Style Sheets," so usage of this acronym has declined significantly.

**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

There can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.


**[Applicable Platform]** 

XSS flaws are very common in web applications, since they require a great deal of developer discipline to avoid them.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-25926:** Python Library Manager did not sufficiently neutralize a user-supplied search term, allowing reflected XSS.
- **CVE-2021-25963:** Python-based e-commerce platform did not escape returned content on error pages, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

## CWE-156: Improper Neutralization of Whitespace
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as whitespace when they are sent to a downstream component.

- **CVE-2003-1015:** MIE. whitespace interpreted differently by mail clients.




## CWE-1007: Insufficient Visual Distinction of Homoglyphs Presented to User
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product displays information or identifiers to a user, but the display mechanism does not make it easy for the user to distinguish between visually similar or identical glyphs (homoglyphs), which may cause the user to misinterpret a glyph and perform an unintended, insecure action.

### Extended Description


Some glyphs, pictures, or icons can be semantically distinct to a program, while appearing very similar or identical to a human user. These are referred to as homoglyphs. For example, the lowercase "l" (ell) and uppercase "I" (eye) have different character codes, but these characters can be displayed in exactly the same way to a user, depending on the font. This can also occur between different character sets. For example, the Latin capital letter "A" and the Greek capital letter "Α" (Alpha) are treated as distinct by programs, but may be displayed in exactly the same way to a user. Accent marks may also cause letters to appear very similar, such as the Latin capital letter grave mark "À" and its equivalent "Á" with the acute accent.


Adversaries can exploit this visual similarity for attacks such as phishing, e.g. by providing a link to an attacker-controlled hostname that looks like a hostname that the victim trusts. In a different use of homoglyphs, an adversary may create a back door username that is visually similar to the username of a regular user, which then makes it more difficult for a system administrator to detect the malicious username while reviewing logs.


### Alternative Terms
Homograph Attack: "Homograph" is often used as a synonym of "homoglyph" by researchers, but according to Wikipedia, a homograph is a word that has multiple, distinct meanings.
