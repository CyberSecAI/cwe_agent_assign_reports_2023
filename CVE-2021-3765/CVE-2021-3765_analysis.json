Since the vulnerability specifically involves an **inefficient regular expression**, CWE-1333 is a more precise and appropriate classification than its parent, CWE-407, which covers general algorithmic complexity issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe407 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **inefficient regular expression complexity** (CWE-1333) in the `rtrim` function, leading to excessive CPU consumption when processing crafted inputs. This, in turn, results in a denial-of-service condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, which clearly indicates that the vulnerability stems from the use of an **inefficient regular expression** in the `validator.js` library. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" highlights the \"**rootcause: inefficient regular expression complexity**\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this by stating that the vulnerability \"stems from the use of a regular expression in the `rtrim` function... Specifically, the regex `/[${chars.replace(/[.\\*+?^${}()|[\\]\\\\]/g, '\\\\$&')}]+$/g` is used which is vulnerable to ReDoS attacks...\".\n\nCWE-1333, \"Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity,\" is selected as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause described in the vulnerability report. While CWE-407, \"Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity,\" is also relevant, it is a more general classification. Given the specificity of the vulnerability description, CWE-1333 provides a more accurate and detailed representation of the weakness.\n\nThe graph relationships further solidify this decision, as CWE-1333 is a child of CWE-407, indicating a more specific instance of the broader algorithmic complexity issue. The selection of CWE-1333 is at the optimal level of specificity, providing a precise characterization of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following
