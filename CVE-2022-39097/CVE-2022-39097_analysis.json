It is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). However, the provided information is precise about the **missing permission check**, so a more specific child is not required.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission check** (CWE-862) in the power management service, leading to the ability to set up the power management service without proper authorization.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-862 as the primary candidate due to the explicit mention of a **missing permission check**. The retriever results also listed CWE-862 as the top candidate, further reinforcing this choice. The analysis considered the abstraction level and relationship to other CWEs, especially the parent relationships. The evidence from the vulnerability description key phrases directly supports this classification.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states: \"In power management service, there is a **missing permission check**. This could lead to set up power management service with no additional execution privileges needed.\" This statement is direct evidence for the **missing authorization**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity because the description specifically states a **missing permission check**, which aligns directly with the definition of CWE-862. While the CWE is a class and may have more specific children, the provided information does not indicate any specific type of permission check that is missing, so the class level is the most appropriate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
