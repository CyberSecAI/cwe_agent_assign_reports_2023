# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-44854

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.35.5, 1.36.x before 1.36.3, and 1.37.x before 1.37.1. The REST API publicly caches results from private wikis.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **product:** MediaWiki
- **version:** before 1.35.5, 1.36.x before 1.36.3, and 1.37.x before 1.37.1
- **component:** REST API

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44854:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an incorrect caching of results from private wikis by the MediaWiki REST API. Specifically, the autocomplete search functionality was caching results, including page titles, which could then be accessed by unauthorized users who did not have access to those private wikis. This is due to incorrect cache headers being set or the system not properly distinguishing between public and private content when caching.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Caching:** The primary vulnerability is the improper caching mechanism that doesn't respect the privacy settings of wikis. Public caches were storing information from private wikis.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allowed unauthorized access to potentially confidential data, such as titles of pages within private wikis. This exposure happened through the autocomplete dropdown menu when a user was logged out.
*   **Incorrect API Configuration:** Though the configuration seemed fine, the API was not properly configured to prevent caching of private content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** The main impact was the potential exposure of page titles from private wikis. This could include sensitive internal project names, personal information, or other confidential information present in page titles.
*   **Potential for further attacks:** Although the impact was initially assessed as low, the vulnerability could potentially facilitate further attacks if the disclosed information was sensitive enough.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack vector is through the network, using the MediaWiki REST API. An unauthenticated user could send a search query via the API and receive cached, unauthorized results, which was revealed via the autocomplete functionality.
*   **Specifically, it was done by triggering the autocomplete search feature of the new Vector skin, by typing in the search bar while being logged out.**

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker did not need to be logged in or have any special access permissions to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Basic Network Access:** The attacker only required basic network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable API endpoint.
*   **Knowledge of the MediaWiki instance:** The attacker had to have knowledge of a MediaWiki instance using the new Vector skin.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was identified in the context of the new Vector skin where the autocomplete search functionality was exposing the cached page titles.
*   The fix involved changes to prevent caching of search results from private wikis.
*   Patches were applied to multiple branches of MediaWiki core (1.35, 1.36, 1.37, and master), indicating that several versions were affected.
*   The initial risk rating was low but it was later recognized as a security issue that required proper handling and patching.
*   The vulnerability was resolved, and the fix was made public through Gerrit.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-524: Use of Cache Containing Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The code uses a cache that contains sensitive information, but the cache can be read by an actor outside of the intended control sphere.

### Extended Description
Applications may use caches to improve efficiency when communicating with remote entities or performing intensive calculations. A cache maintains a pool of objects, threads, connections, pages, financial data, passwords, or other resources to minimize the time it takes to initialize and access these resources. If the cache is accessible to unauthorized actors, attackers can read the cache and obtain this sensitive information.

### Alternative Terms

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses




## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Exhaustion

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-834

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2007-1285:** Deeply nested arrays trigger stack exhaustion.
- **CVE-2007-3409:** Self-referencing pointers create infinite loop and resultant stack exhaustion.
- **CVE-2016-10707:** Javascript application accidentally changes input in a way that prevents a recursive call from detecting an exit condition.




## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-285
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.

### Extended Description


Limited resources include memory, file system storage, database connection pool entries, and CPU. If an attacker can trigger the allocation of these limited resources, but the number or size of the resources is not controlled, then the attacker could cause a denial of service that consumes all available resources. This would prevent valid users from accessing the product, and it could potentially have an impact on the surrounding environment. For example, a memory exhaustion attack against an application could slow down the application as well as its host operating system.


There are at least three distinct scenarios which can commonly lead to resource exhaustion:


  - Lack of throttling for the number of allocated resources

  - Losing all references to a resource before reaching the shutdown stage

  - Not closing/returning a resource after processing

Resource exhaustion problems are often result due to an incorrect implementation of the following situations:

  - Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.

  - Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.



### Alternative Terms
Resource Exhaustion

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-664

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the "technical impact" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is causing resource consumption, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake. Consider children/descendants such as CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling, CWE-771: Missing Reference to Active Allocated Resource, CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool, CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime, CWE-834: Excessive Iteration, CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification), and others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** "Resource consumption" could be interpreted as a consequence instead of an insecure behavior, so this entry is being considered for modification. It appears to be referenced too frequently when more precise mappings are available. Some of its children, such as CWE-771, might be better considered as a chain.

**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. "Resource exhaustion" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.

**[Other]** 

Database queries that take a long time to process are good DoS targets. An attacker would have to write a few lines of Perl code to generate enough traffic to exceed the site's ability to keep up. This would effectively prevent authorized users from using the site at all. Resources can be exploited simply by ensuring that the target machine must do much more work and consume more resources in order to service a request than the attacker must do to initiate a request.


A prime example of this can be found in old switches that were vulnerable to "macof" attacks (so named for a tool developed by Dugsong). These attacks flooded a switch with random IP and MAC address combinations, therefore exhausting the switch's cache, which held the information of which port corresponded to which MAC addresses. Once this cache was exhausted, the switch would fail in an insecure way and would begin to act simply as a hub, broadcasting all traffic on all ports and allowing for basic sniffing attacks.


**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2020-7218:** Go-based workload orchestrator does not limit resource usage with unauthenticated connections, allowing a DoS by flooding the service
- **CVE-2020-3566:** Resource exhaustion in distributed OS because of "insufficient" IGMP queue management, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-525: Use of Web Browser Cache Containing Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The web application does not use an appropriate caching policy that specifies the extent to which each web page and associated form fields should be cached.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-524

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use






## CWE-202: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When trying to keep information confidential, an attacker can often infer some of the information by using statistics.

### Extended Description
In situations where data should not be tied to individual users, but a large number of users should be able to make queries that "scrub" the identity of users, it may be possible to get information about a user -- e.g., by specifying search terms that are known to be unique to that user.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1230

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** 

The relationship between CWE-202 and CWE-612 needs to be investigated more closely, as they may be different descriptions of the same kind of problem. CWE-202 is also being considered for deprecation, as it is not clearly described and may have been misunderstood by CWE users. It could be argued that this issue is better covered by CAPEC; an attacker can utilize their data-query privileges to perform this kind of operation, and if the attacker should not be allowed to perform the operation - or if the sensitive data should not have been made accessible at all - then that is more appropriately classified as a separate CWE related to authorization (see the parent, CWE-1230).




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-41935:** Wiki product allows an adversary to discover filenames via a series of queries starting with one letter and then iteratively extending the match.




## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.

### Extended Description


There are many different kinds of mistakes that introduce information exposures. The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker. Some kinds of sensitive information include:


  - private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details

  - system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages

  - business secrets and intellectual property

  - network status and configuration

  - the product's own code or internal state

  - metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers

  - indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider

Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected. These parties include:

  - the product's own users

  - people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users

  - the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates

  - the developer

Information exposures can occur in different ways:

  - the code  **explicitly inserts**  sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been "scrubbed" or "sanitized"

  - a different weakness or mistake  **indirectly inserts**  the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.

  - the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are  **unintentionally made accessible**  to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.

It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an "information exposure," but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read. CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store, transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

### Alternative Terms
Information Disclosure: This term is frequently used in vulnerability advisories to describe a consequence or technical impact, for any vulnerability that has a loss of confidentiality. Often, CWE-200 can be misused to represent the loss of confidentiality, even when the mistake - i.e., the weakness - is not directly related to the mishandling of the information itself, such as an out-of-bounds read that accesses sensitive memory contents; here, the out-of-bounds read is the primary weakness, not the disclosure of the memory. In addition, this phrase is also used frequently in policies and legal documents, but it does not refer to any disclosure of security-relevant information.
Information Leak: This is a frequently used term, however the "leak" term has multiple uses within security. In some cases it deals with the accidental exposure of information from a different weakness, but in other cases (such as "memory leak"), this deals with improper tracking of resources, which can lead to exhaustion. As a result, CWE is actively avoiding usage of the "leak" term.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].
**Comments:** If an error or mistake causes information to be disclosed, then use the CWE ID for that error. Consider starting with improper authorization (CWE-285), insecure permissions (CWE-732), improper authentication (CWE-287), etc. Also consider children such as Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data (CWE-201), Observable Discrepancy (CWE-203), Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory (CWE-538), or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As a result of mapping analysis in the 2020 Top 25 and more recent versions, this weakness is under review, since it is frequently misused in mapping to cover many problems that lead to loss of confidentiality. See Mapping Notes, Extended Description, and Alternate Terms.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-31162:** Rust library leaks Oauth client details in application debug logs
- **CVE-2021-25476:** Digital Rights Management (DRM) capability for mobile platform leaks pointer information, simplifying ASLR bypass
- **CVE-2001-1483:** Enumeration of valid usernames based on inconsistent responses




## CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Privacy violation
Privacy leak
Privacy leakage

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-200

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry overlaps many other entries that are not organized around the kind of sensitive information that is exposed. However, because privacy is treated with such importance due to regulations and other factors, and it may be useful for weakness-finding tools to highlight capabilities that detect personal private information instead of system information, it is not clear whether - and how - this entry should be deprecated.

**[Other]** 

There are many types of sensitive information that products must protect from attackers, including system data, communications, configuration, business secrets, intellectual property, and an individual's personal (private) information. Private personal information may include a password, phone number, geographic location, personal messages, credit card number, etc. Private information is important to consider whether the person is a user of the product, or part of a data set that is processed by the product. An exposure of private information does not necessarily prevent the product from working properly, and in fact the exposure might be intended by the developer, e.g. as part of data sharing with other organizations. However, the exposure of personal private information can still be undesirable or explicitly prohibited by law or regulation.


Some types of private information include:


  - Government identifiers, such as Social Security Numbers

  - Contact information, such as home addresses and telephone numbers

  - Geographic location - where the user is (or was)

  - Employment history

  - Financial data - such as credit card numbers, salary, bank accounts, and debts

  - Pictures, video, or audio

  - Behavioral patterns - such as web surfing history, when certain activities are performed, etc.

  - Relationships (and types of relationships) with others - family, friends, contacts, etc.

  - Communications - e-mail addresses, private messages, text messages, chat logs, etc.

  - Health - medical conditions, insurance status, prescription records

  - Account passwords and other credentials

Some of this information may be characterized as PII (Personally Identifiable Information), Protected Health Information (PHI), etc. Categories of private information may overlap or vary based on the intended usage or the policies and practices of a particular industry.

Sometimes data that is not labeled as private can have a privacy implication in a different context. For example, student identification numbers are usually not considered private because there is no explicit and publicly-available mapping to an individual student's personal information. However, if a school generates identification numbers based on student social security numbers, then the identification numbers should be considered private.







## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-269

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** 

Note: there are 2 separate sub-categories here:

```
		- privilege incorrectly allows entities to perform certain actions
		- object is incorrectly accessible to entities with a given privilege
```




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-1981:** Roles have access to dangerous procedures (Accessible entities).
- **CVE-2002-1671:** Untrusted object/method gets access to clipboard (Accessible entities).
- **CVE-2004-2204:** Gain privileges using functions/tags that should be restricted (Accessible entities).
