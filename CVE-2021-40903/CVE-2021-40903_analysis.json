CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) is a peer of CWE-321 and also a child of CWE-798. This indicates a clear hierarchy where a general weakness (CWE-798) is refined into more specific cases (CWE-321, CWE-259). The choice of CWE-321 is based on the specific evidence of a cryptographic key being hardcoded.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    \n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe259 -- PEEROF --> cwe321\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe321 primary\n    class cwe798,cwe259 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events for this vulnerability is:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Hard-coded cryptographic key** (CWE-321) used for session cookie signing.\n2.  Weakness: The application uses a static secret key instead of generating a unique, random key.\n3.  Impact: Authentication bypass and potential administrative access for attackers.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified several candidate CWEs based on the vulnerability description. The description mentions a **\"backdoor or misconfiguration\"** and a **\"static\"** secret string. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly states that the root cause is a **\"static secret key ('super secret key')\"** used for signing session cookies, present in the application's `settings.py` file.\n\nThe Retriever Results listed CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key), CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials), and CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) as highly relevant.\n\nCWE-321 was ultimately selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description and supporting evidence specifically mention a cryptographic key being hard-coded, which is the precise scenario described by CWE-321. The confidence in this mapping is high (1.0) because the evidence directly supports the CWE's characteristics.\n\nCWE-798 was considered as a more general classification, since CWE-321 is a child of CWE-798. However, CWE-321 provides a more accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability. CWE-259 was also considered, since the hard-coded key is used for authentication. However, the primary issue is the cryptographic key itself being hard-coded, rather than just a password.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
