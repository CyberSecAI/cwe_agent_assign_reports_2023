This indicates a parent-child relationship where CWE-321 is a more specific case of CWE-798. The vulnerability involves a hard-coded *cryptographic key*, making CWE-321 a more precise fit than the broader CWE-798 which covers any type of hard-coded credential.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1391\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe321 primary\n    class cwe798 secondary\n    class cwe1391 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a hard-coded cryptographic key** [**CWE-321**] in the registration mechanism. This leads to the impact where a local attacker can disable and uninstall the collectors.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points to CWE-321 as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**use of hard-coded cryptographic key**\" which directly maps to CWE-321. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further reinforces this by stating, \"The FortiEDR collectors utilize a hardcoded cryptographic key in their registration mechanism\" and \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Use of a hard-coded cryptographic key (CWE-321) within the FortiEDR collector registration process.\"\n\nCWE-798 was considered because it's a parent of CWE-321 and covers the broader case of hard-coded credentials. While applicable, CWE-321 is more specific and therefore a better fit.\n\nThe final decision is based on the explicit mention of a hard-coded cryptographic key, the retriever results which list CWE-321 as the top match, and the CWE specifications which confirm the appropriateness of CWE-321 for this vulnerability. The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity (Variant) as it directly addresses the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
