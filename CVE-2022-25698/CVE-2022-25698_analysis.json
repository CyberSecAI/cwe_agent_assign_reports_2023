The vulnerability description mentions memory corruption due to improper input validation. CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-1285 (Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input) is a child of CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation). CWE-787 can follow CWE-823 (Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe1285[\"CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe1285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe1285,cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with **improper input validation**, which leads to **memory corruption**, specifically an out-of-bounds write. The chain is: Improper Input Validation -> Out-of-bounds Write.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description states: \"Memory corruption in SPI buses due to **improper input validation** while reading address configuration from spi buses in Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Wearables\".\n\nThe key phrases are:\n- **rootcause:** **improper input validation**\n- **weakness:** **memory corruption**\n\nThe primary weakness is **memory corruption**, and the root cause is **improper input validation**.\n\nCWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) aligns with the **memory corruption** aspect of the vulnerability. The description of CWE-787 states: \"The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\" Given the **memory corruption** mentioned in the description, CWE-787 is a good fit.\n\nCWE-1285 (Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input) aligns with the **improper input validation** aspect, especially since it involves reading address configuration. The description for CWE-1285 states: \"The product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.\"\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is a more general weakness. While **improper input validation** is the root cause, CWE-1285 is a more specific base-level CWE that describes the specific type of **improper input validation** that led to the vulnerability. Therefore, I will include CWE-20 as a secondary candidate but not the primary CWE.\n\nI am selecting CWE-787 as the primary CWE as the description states that the root cause leads to **memory corruption** so there is evidence to make that mapping with high confidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-704: Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly convert an object, resource, or structure from one type to a different type.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Reason not selected*: This vulnerability doesn't seem to have anything to do with type conversion.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason not selected*: The description does not indicate that the validation is about equivalence of unsafe values.\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
