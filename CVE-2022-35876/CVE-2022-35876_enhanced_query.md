# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-35876

# Vulnerability Description

    Four **format string injection** vulnerabilities exist in the XCMD testWifiAP functionality of Abode Systems, Inc. iota All-In-One Security Kit 6.9X and 6.9Z. Specially-crafted configuration values can lead to **memory corruption**, **information disclosure** and denial of service. An attacker can modify a configuration value and then execute an XCMD to trigger these vulnerabilities.This vulnerability arises from **format string injection** via the `default_key_id` and `key` configuration parameters, as used within the `testWifiAP` XCMD handler

    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'format string injection'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String (Score: 1181.98)

The product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source....

### 2. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 445.09)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...
