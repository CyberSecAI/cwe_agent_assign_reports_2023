CWE-73 is considered as a related weakness where user input controls file names or paths, potentially exacerbating the path traversal.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n\n    cwe22 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe73\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the application mounting the root filesystem as `/rootfs` which enables unrestricted file system access. The **root cause** is the **improper limitation** on accessible paths (CWE-22). This allows attackers to manipulate file paths using Lua scripts, potentially leading to user data rewrite or extraction.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis indicates that the Stepmania application **improperly limits** pathnames, allowing access to the entire file system via `/rootfs`. This is a clear case of CWE-22. The analysis is heavily based on the provided evidence, specifically:\n\n*   \"The component /rootfs in RageFile of Stepmania v5.1b2 and below allows attackers access to the entire file system.\"\n*   \"The vulnerability stems from the fact that on Linux systems, the root filesystem `/` was mounted as `/rootfs` within the `RageFile` system of the Stepmania application. This allowed Lua scripts to access and manipulate any part of the file system via `/rootfs`.\"\n\nCWE-22 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **improper limitation** of a pathname to a restricted directory, which is the core issue in this vulnerability. The retriever results and the graph relationships support this conclusion. CWE-73 is a plausible secondary CWE because the vulnerability involves external control of file names or paths through Lua scripting, which could facilitate the path traversal. However, CWE-22 more accurately describes the **root cause**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
