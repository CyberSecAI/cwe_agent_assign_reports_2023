CWE-863 is a child of CWE-284 and represents a more specific type of access control issue, namely incorrect authorization. CWE-280 is another potential classification, focusing on the handling of insufficient privileges. While the description points to **improper access control**, the specific mechanism isn't detailed enough to go for a base variant, thus CWE-284 is selected as primary.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe280[\"CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe280 -->|RELATED| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe280 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control** in `clearAllGlobalProxy`, which leads to a local attacker being able to configure EDM settings. The root cause is the access control issue, and the impact is the ability to configure EDM settings.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis points to **improper access control** as the root cause, with the ability to configure EDM settings as the impact. The evidence from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" explicitly states \"**rootcause:** **Improper access control**\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also states, \"Improper access control vulnerability in `clearAllGlobalProxy` in `MiscPolicy`.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the hierarchical structure, with CWE-284 being a high-level category encompassing more specific issues like incorrect authorization (CWE-863) and improper handling of insufficient privileges (CWE-280). However, the provided evidence does not give enough detail to make a better decision than CWE-284.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity given the available information. CWE-284 is a general category, but it accurately reflects the **improper access control** issue. More specific CWEs like CWE-863 could be considered if more information about the authorization mechanism was available.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
