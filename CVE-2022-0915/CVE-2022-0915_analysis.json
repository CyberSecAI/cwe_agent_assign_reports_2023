It is a child of the Class CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    \n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe367 primary\n    class cwe362 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of the **TOCTOU race condition**, which leads to the impact of escalating permissions to the system user.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates a **TOCTOU race condition**. The description key phrases highlight the **rootcause** as a **TOCTOU race condition**.\nThe retriever results show that CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition) is a relevant candidate.\n\nThe description of CWE-367 states: \"The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.\"\n\nThe vulnerability description directly states there is a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition. The direct evidence makes CWE-367 the best fit. The mapping guidance for CWE-367 indicates that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level, and its usage is \"Allowed\".\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
