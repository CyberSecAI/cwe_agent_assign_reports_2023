While CWE-407 (Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity) is a broader class, CWE-1333 specifically addresses the inefficiency within regular expressions, making it a more precise fit for the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe407 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity** (CWE-1333) due to catastrophic backtracking.\n2.  **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) or Application Slowdown.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-1333 as the most appropriate mapping due to the vulnerability's root cause being an **inefficient regular expression**. This inefficiency leads to excessive CPU consumption and potential denial of service.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states: \"semver-regex is vulnerable to **Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating that the vulnerability is a ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) issue caused by catastrophic backtracking in the original regex. The fix involved limiting the repetition of certain groups and characters in the regex.\n\nThe retriever results also strongly support CWE-1333 as the primary candidate.\n\nThe relationship analysis further solidified this choice. CWE-1333 is a child of CWE-407 (Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity), making it a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability's root cause.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, CWE-1333 is the optimal level of specificity for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
