The product **does not properly verify authorizations when displaying the content of tracker report renderer and chart widgets**. |\n| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 0.6 | Pillar | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability is related to access control issues, but CWE-862 is more specific. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship is that CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). This indicates that CWE-862 is a more specific type of access control issue. Since the vulnerability description and CVE details clearly point to a **missing authorization** check, CWE-862 is chosen as the primary CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a **missing authorization** check, leading to information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **root cause** as the application's failure to **properly verify authorizations** when displaying tracker report data, allowing unauthorized users to access information they should not have access to. The **evidence** supporting this assessment includes the vulnerability description stating the application \"**does not properly verify authorizations when displaying the content of tracker report renderer and chart widgets**\" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary highlighting the **\"Insufficient Authorization Checks\"** as the primary vulnerability.\n\nBased on the provided information, CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is the most appropriate classification because the application **does not perform an authorization check** when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, directly aligning with the vulnerability's core issue. While CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) could be considered, it's a high-level category, and CWE-862 provides a more specific and accurate representation of the **missing authorization** problem.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **lack of authorization checks**. This is consistent with the principle of choosing the most detailed (child) CWE over a generic (parent) CWE when the evidence supports it.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n\n## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6863.94\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 6712.97\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 6610.53\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 6590.79\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 6539.54\n\n## CWE-322: Key Exchange without Entity Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 5.03\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n\n## CWE-178: Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 3.76\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 3.33\n\n## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n**Abstraction Level**: class\n**Similarity Score**: 2.98\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.87\n\n## CWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.87\n\n## CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains\n**Abstraction Level**: variant\n**Similarity Score**: 2.68\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: class\n**Similarity Score**: 2.55\n\n## CWE-350: Reliance on Reverse DNS Resolution for a Security-Critical Action\n**Abstraction Level**: variant\n**Similarity Score**: 2.55\n\n**CWE Considerations:**\n*   CWE-284 (Improper Access Control): Considered but deemed too general.\n*   CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization): Considered, but the vulnerability is due to a **missing** check, not an **incorrect** one.\n*   CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key): While a user-controlled key might be involved, the core issue is the **missing authorization** check.",
