The vulnerability involves an **observable behavioral discrepancy** that allows attackers to obtain system information without permission. The abstraction level of CWE-205 is Base, which is preferred.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe205[\"CWE-205: Observable Behavioral Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe203[\"CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe205 -->|CHILDOF| cwe203\n    cwe205 -->|PEEROF| cwe668\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe205 primary\n    class cwe203,cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **observable behavioral discrepancy**, which leads to the exposure of sensitive system information to unauthorized actors, ultimately allowing them to obtain this information without proper permissions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description's key phrase \"**observable behavioral discrepancy**,\" strongly suggests CWE-205, \"Observable Behavioral Discrepancy.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating the root cause is \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor.\"\n\nThe retriever results also support CWE-205 as the best match, with a high score. While CWE-203 is a parent, CWE-205 is more specific and thus preferred. CWE-668 \"Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\" was considered since unauthorized access is involved, but it is too general and discouraged.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-205 is based on the evidence of the **observable behavioral discrepancy** being the **rootcause**, the high retriever score, and the appropriateness of its base abstraction level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names.

This could allow an attacker to cause the product to operate on unauthorized files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
