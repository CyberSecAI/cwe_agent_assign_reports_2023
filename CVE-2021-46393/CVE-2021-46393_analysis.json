CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119, Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, indicating a hierarchical relationship. CWE-120, Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input, is also a child of CWE-119. CWE-120 can precede CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition) in a vulnerability chain. The abstraction levels guided the selection, with a preference for the most specific variant (CWE-121).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe123\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe787,cwe120 secondary\n    class cwe119, cwe123 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of the `startIp` parameter**, leading to a **stack buffer overflow** due to the usage of `sscanf` without proper bounds checking, which results in the potential for **remote code execution**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points to a **stack buffer overflow** (CWE-121) due to the **lack of input validation** when using `sscanf` to process the `startIp` parameter. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **stack buffer overflow** and provides details on how the `v10` variable is retrieved from the HTTP request and then spliced to the stack without security checks, leading to a stack overflow.\n\nThe analysis is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description: \"There is a **stack buffer overflow** vulnerability in the formSetPPTPServer function of Tenda-AX3 router V16.03.12.10_CN. The v10 variable is directly retrieved from the http request parameter startIp. Then v10 will be splice to stack by function sscanf without any security check,which causes **stack overflow**.\"\n\nThe graph relationships confirm the hierarchical nature of the CWEs, guiding the selection of the most specific CWE. CWE-121 is chosen as the primary CWE because it accurately reflects the specific nature of the **buffer overflow** occurring on the stack.\n\nCWE-121, Stack-based Buffer Overflow, is at the optimal level of specificity because it clearly defines the type of buffer overflow.
