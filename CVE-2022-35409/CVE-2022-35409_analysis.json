This parent-child relationship indicates that CWE-126 is a more specific case of CWE-125. Since the vulnerability description specifically mentions a buffer over-read, the more specific variant CWE-126 is chosen. Other relationships, like those associated with integer overflows or incorrect calculations of buffer size, were considered but ultimately deemed less relevant because the core issue is the act of reading beyond the buffer's boundaries.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    \n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe125\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe126 primary\n    class cwe125 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the attacker sending an invalid ClientHello message. Due to **improper validation** of the cookie length, a **heap-based buffer over-read** occurs, potentially leading to a server crash or information disclosure.\n\nInvalid ClientHello --> **Improper Validation** (Implicit) --> **Heap-based Buffer Over-read** (CWE-126) --> Server Crash / Information Disclosure\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed towards a buffer over-read scenario. The vulnerability description explicitly states \"**heap-based buffer over-read**\" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause is a buffer overread due to the length of the cookie not being properly validated against the actual message length. This over-read can overlap with sensitive memory regions, potentially leading to information disclosure.\n\nBased on this evidence, CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read) was selected as the primary CWE. While CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is a parent of CWE-126, the description provides enough detail to specify the over-read condition, making CWE-126 the optimal choice.\n\nThe selection is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the supporting CVE details. The relationship analysis confirms that the chosen CWE is at the appropriate level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as
