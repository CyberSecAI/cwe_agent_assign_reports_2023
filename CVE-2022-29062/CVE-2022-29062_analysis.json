CWE-23 is a child of CWE-22 and represents relative path traversal, a specific type of path traversal. CWE-73 is related because it describes the external control of file names or paths, which is a prerequisite for path traversal vulnerabilities. The abstraction levels influenced the decision to choose CWE-22 as primary because it directly aligns with the vulnerability description, while acknowledging the relevance of the more specific CWE-23 and related CWE-73.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe23[\"CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n\n    cwe23 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe22\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe23,cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the application's **improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory (CWE-22)**, specifically through **relative path traversal (CWE-23)**. This is facilitated by **external control of file name or path (CWE-73)**, which allows an attacker to inject malicious path sequences. The ultimate impact is the ability to **write to the underlying filesystem**, leading to improper access control.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description stating \"Multiple **relative path traversal** vulnerabilities [CWE-23] in Fortinet FortiSOAR before 7.2.1 allows an authenticated attacker to write to the underlying filesystem with nginx permissions via crafted HTTP requests,\" strongly suggests CWE-23. However, after reviewing the retriever results, complete CWE specifications, and relationship analysis, it's more accurate to classify this as CWE-22. The evidence from \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" supports this: \"Root cause of vulnerability: Multiple relative path traversal vulnerabilities in the web API of FortiSOAR\" and \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Path traversal (CWE-23)\".\n\nThe decision to select CWE-22 as the primary weakness is based on its broader scope encompassing path traversal vulnerabilities in general, while CWE-23 is a specific type. Given that the description mentions \"relative path traversal vulnerabilities\" but the core issue is the **improper limitation of a pathname**, CWE-22 is a more fitting primary classification. CWE-23 remains relevant as a secondary classification to specify the type of path traversal.\n\nCWE-73 is included because the attacker is able to control part of the file path, which is a prerequisite for path traversal.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately capture the root cause and contributing factors of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant
