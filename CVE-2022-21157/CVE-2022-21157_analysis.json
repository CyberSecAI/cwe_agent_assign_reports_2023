While this is a high-level category, the evidence provided points to a general **improper access control** issue. CWE-284's description includes the product not restricting or incorrectly restricting access to a resource from an unauthorized actor, which aligns with the vulnerability description. However, CWE-284 is discouraged and has suggested alternative CWEs.\n\nCWE-863, a child of CWE-284, represents Incorrect Authorization. This is a Class level weakness which is more specific than CWE-284. The vulnerability description notes **improper access control**, and the impact is information disclosure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause**: **Improper access control** (CWE-284) allows authenticated users to perform actions they shouldn't be able to, potentially due to an authorization problem.\n2.  **Impact**: Information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitial analysis focused on the explicit mention of **improper access control** as the root cause. The vulnerability description clearly states: \"**Improper access control** in the Intel(R) Smart Campus Android application before version 6.1 may allow authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.\"\n\nThe Retriever Results listed CWE-284 as the top candidate. However, CWE-284 is a Pillar-level CWE and is discouraged. The retriever results also listed CWE-863 which is more specific.\n\nThe relationships between CWEs influenced the decision to include CWE-863 as a secondary candidate because it is a child of CWE-284 and a class level weakness. The final selection of CWE-284 as the primary and CWE-863 as secondary reflects the information provided, with the understanding that a more specific CWE might be applicable with more detailed information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used**: While related to access control, this CWE focuses on isolation, which isn't the primary issue described.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used**: This CWE is unrelated to the described vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Why Not Used**: This CWE is unrelated to the described vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Why Not Used**: This CWE is unrelated to the described vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.
