CWE-416 is a Variant, making it more specific than its parent CWEs, but in this case, the description focuses on the **use after free** condition, and not on what caused it, so selecting the Variant is appropriate. CWE-787 was considered because **heap corruption** can often lead to out-of-bounds writes.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on a Resource after Expiration or Release\"]\n\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe416 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a crafted HTML page leading to a **use after free** condition in the Splitscreen component of Google Chrome, which then allows for potential **heap corruption**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed towards CWE-416 due to the explicit mention of \"**use after free**\" in both the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The primary CWE match from similar CVE descriptions also reinforced this choice.\n\nThe evidence:\n- Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:\n  - **rootcause:** **use after free**\n  - **weakness:** **heap corruption**\n- CVE Reference Links Content Summary:\n  - \"root_cause\": \"Use after free in Splitscreen.\"\n  - \"weaknesses\": [\"Use after free\"]\n\nThe graph relationships and the retriever results further solidified the selection of CWE-416.\n\nCWE-787 was considered as a potential secondary CWE due to the mention of \"**heap corruption**,\" which can often lead to out-of-bounds writes. However, the primary focus of the description is on the **use after free** condition, so CWE-416 is the more appropriate primary classification.\n\nThe selection of CWE-416 as the primary CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability as described in the provided information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE was not selected because the
