The evidence provided clearly indicates that the application does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences, allowing attackers to access files outside the restricted directory.\n\nThe selection of CWE-36 is based on the vulnerability description, which mentions **absolute path traversal**, and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states that `os.path.join` is unsafe when an absolute path is provided.\n\nCWE-73 was considered because the vulnerability involves external control of a file path. However, the vulnerability is more specifically related to **absolute path traversal**, making CWE-36 a more accurate fit.\n\nThe final selection is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which both point to **absolute path traversal** as the primary weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
