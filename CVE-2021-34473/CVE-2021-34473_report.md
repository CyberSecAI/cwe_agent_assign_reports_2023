# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2021-34473

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-918 | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-918, which is a Base level CWE. CWE-918 is related to CWE-441 (Unintended Proxy or Intermediary) and CWE-610 (Improper Handling of Alternate Encoding). CWE-20 is a Class level CWE and parent of more specific CWEs related to input validation. I've chosen CWE-918 as the primary because the description explicitly mentions SSRF and improper URI validation. While CWE-20 is related, it's a broader category and less specific than CWE-918 in this context.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with **improper input validation** (CWE-20) of URIs within the Autodiscover service, leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability (CWE-918). This allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected Microsoft Exchange Server installations.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified both CWE-918 and CWE-20 as potential candidates. CWE-918 directly addresses the Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) aspect, while CWE-20 covers the **improper input validation** that leads to it. The provided information explicitly mentions both SSRF and **improper URI validation**, making CWE-918 a strong primary candidate.

The decision to include CWE-20 as a secondary CWE acknowledges the **rootcause** of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description key phrases highlights "**improper input validation**" as a **rootcause**, and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary mentions "Improper URI validation."

The final selection of CWE-918 as primary and CWE-20 as secondary reflects the vulnerability's nature and the provided evidence. The relationship graph highlights the connection between the **improper input validation** and the resulting SSRF.

**CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.
*Evidence:* The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of URIs within the Autodiscover service of Microsoft Exchange Server before accessing resources. This aligns with the description of CWE-918, where the server fails to validate the destination of the request.

**CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**
The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly.
*Evidence:* The **rootcause** is **improper input validation**. The Autodiscover service does not properly validate URIs, leading to the vulnerability. This is a high-level classification, but accurate.

**CWEs Considered But Not Used**

*   **CWE-84, Improper Neutralization of Encoded URI Schemes in a Web Page:** While URI encoding might be a factor, the primary issue is the lack of validation of the URI itself, rather than the encoding. Therefore, it is less applicable than CWE-918 and CWE-20.
*   **CWE-502, Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** This is not a deserialization issue. The vulnerability is about making requests to untrusted servers, not deserializing data.
*   **CWE-36, Absolute Path Traversal and CWE-22, Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'):** These are related to file path manipulation, which is not the primary issue here. The vulnerability concerns network requests.
*   **CWE-94, Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'):** While the impact includes code execution, the root cause is not the generation of code, but rather the **improper input validation** leading to SSRF.
*   **CWE-287, Improper Authentication:** While the summary mentions "Authentication Bypass", the root cause is the SSRF from lack of
