CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] can result from missing authorization, making it a potential secondary effect rather than the root cause. The abstraction levels guided selection towards CWE-862 as a Class-level weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe200 -->|CANRESULTFROM| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control** (identified in the vulnerability description and CVE summary) leading to **missing authorization** (CWE-862), which results in **information disclosure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **improper access control** as the root cause, leading to the selection of CWE-862 [Missing Authorization] as the primary CWE. The vulnerability description mentions \"a possible information disclosure due to **improper access control**.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this: \"Root cause: **Improper access control** in aee daemon. Weaknesses: **Improper access control**. Impact: Local information disclosure.\"\n\nCWE-862's description, \"The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action,\" aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description. The evidence strongly supports this classification.\n\nCWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] was considered as a secondary CWE because the impact of the vulnerability is information disclosure. However, CWE-200 is discouraged by MITRE as it is often misused to represent the impact of a vulnerability rather than the root cause. In this case, the **improper access control** is the root cause, and the information disclosure is the result.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **missing authorization** aspect of the vulnerability, which is a more precise characterization than the broader **improper access control**.\n```",
