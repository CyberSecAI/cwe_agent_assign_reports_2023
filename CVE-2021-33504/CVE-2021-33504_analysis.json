Given the description only mentions **incorrect access control**, the higher-level CWE-284 is more appropriate, but CWE-863 is a close candidate, since authorization is a mechanism used in access control.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a single point of **incorrect access control**, leading to an exploitable state.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered both CWE-284 and CWE-863. The final decision favored CWE-284 due to the high-level nature of the vulnerability description, which simply mentions **incorrect access control**. The evidence available supports this classification, as the provided snippets indicate a general access control issue without specifying the exact mechanism.\n\nBased on the provided evidence only, and shows or quotes that evidence:\n\n*   The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** mentions \"**rootcause:** **incorrect access control**\"\n*   The Retriever Results identified CWE-284 as the top candidate.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the parent-child relationship between CWE-284 and CWE-863.\n\nThe selected CWE is at an appropriate level of specificity because the vulnerability description lacks detailed information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 5752.87\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 5576.64\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 5464.09\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor",
