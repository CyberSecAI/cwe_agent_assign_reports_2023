CWE-917 is a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) and CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')). CWE-94 is considered because the **OGNL injection** leads to arbitrary code execution. CWE-74 is a more general class of injection vulnerabilities.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe917[\"CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe917 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe917 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe917 primary\n    class cwe94,cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input sanitization**, which leads to an **OGNL injection** vulnerability and ultimately results in arbitrary code execution.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Improper input sanitization**\n  - **Weakness:** **OGNL injection** (CWE-917)\n  - **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution (CWE-94)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment correctly identified CWE-917 as the primary weakness due to the presence of **OGNL injection**. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **OGNL injection**, and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause is due to an **OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language) injection** flaw.\n\nThe following is quoted from the vulnerability description:\n> In affected versions of Confluence Server and Data Center, an **OGNL injection** vulnerability exists that would allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a Confluence Server or Data Center instance.\n\nThe relationship graph highlights the connection between CWE-917 and its parent CWEs (CWE-74 and CWE-94), further solidifying the selection of CWE-917 as the most specific and appropriate classification.\nCWE-94 is included as a secondary candidate because the OGNL injection leads to code execution.\n\nCWE-20 was considered but not selected because the provided information is more specific than the general class of **improper input validation**.\nCWE-74 was considered but not selected as the primary because CWE-917 provides more specific details related to Expression Language injection.\n\nI am confident in the selection of CWE-917 as the primary weakness, as it directly reflects the **OGNL injection** vulnerability described in the provided information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\nINSERT",
