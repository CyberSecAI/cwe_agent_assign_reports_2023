CWE-74 is a class-level CWE that is related to injection vulnerabilities, and it has child CWEs like CWE-79 and CWE-1336 which are more specific. These relationships helped narrow down the selection to CWE-917 as the most specific and relevant CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe917[\"CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n\n    cwe917 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe917 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe74 -->|Class level of Injection| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe917 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe79,cwe1336 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input sanitization**, which leads to the ability to inject arbitrary wiki syntax. This, in turn, results in **arbitrary code execution**, ultimately leading to modification and disclosure of all content stored in the XWiki installation. The CWEs align with this chain as follows:\n1.  **Improper Input Sanitization** leads to\n2.  CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection') which leads to\n3.  **Arbitrary Code Execution** and **Data Disclosure/Modification**\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified several potential CWEs based on the description of the vulnerability and the retriever results. The key evidence supporting the selection of CWE-917 is the ability to inject arbitrary wiki syntax, including Groovy, Python, and Velocity script macros, via the request (URL parameter). This aligns well with the description of CWE-917, which focuses on **improper neutralization of special elements used in an expression language statement.**\n\nThe vulnerability description key phrases include: \"**rootcause:** **improper input sanitization**\" and \"**weakness:** **arbitrary code execution**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"The core weakness is that the application dynamically evaluates user-provided input within the context of the `translation` macro. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious code that the server would then execute.\"\n\nCWE-74, CWE-79, and CWE-1336 were considered as secondary CWEs, but they are less specific than CWE-917. CWE-74 is a class-level CWE, while CWE-79 and CWE-1336 describe specific types of injection (Cross-site Scripting and Template Engine Injection, respectively). While XSS is possible, it's the expression language injection that is the root cause. The selection of CWE-917 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately reflects the technical details of the vulnerability, which involves injecting code into an expression language statement.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
