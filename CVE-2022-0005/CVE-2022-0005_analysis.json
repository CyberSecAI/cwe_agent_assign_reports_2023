The vulnerability is caused by **sensitive information** being accessible through physical probing of the JTAG interface without proper access control.|\n| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The **sensitive information** is accessible in cleartext. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-1191 (On-Chip Debug and Test Interface With Improper Access Control), a Base-level CWE. It is related to CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), which is a Pillar-level CWE. CWE-1191 is a child of CWE-284, indicating that it's a more specific type of access control issue related to debug interfaces. CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is also included because the information is accessible in cleartext.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1191[\"CWE-1191: On-Chip Debug and Test Interface With Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe1191 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1191 primary\n    class cwe284,cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the following steps:\n1.  **Root Cause:** The JTAG interface lacks proper access control (CWE-1191).\n2.  **Weakness:** **Sensitive information** is accessible via physical probing.\n3.  **Impact:** An unprivileged user can potentially enable information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the lack of proper access control for the JTAG interface, which allows **sensitive information** to be accessed. The analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description, which states that \"**sensitive information** accessible by physical probing of JTAG interface for some Intel(R) Processors with SGX may allow an unprivileged user to potentially enable information disclosure via physical access.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by showing that CWE-1191 is a specific type of improper access control (child of CWE-284), making it a more precise fit than the more general CWE-284.\n\nCWE-1191 is selected because it directly addresses the weakness where the chip does not correctly perform access control to check whether users are authorized to access internal registers and test modes through the physical debug/test interface.\n\nCWE-319 is added as a secondary weakness because the **sensitive information** is transmitted in cleartext.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately reflect the root cause (improper access control on the JTAG interface) and the nature of the data being transmitted (cleartext).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
