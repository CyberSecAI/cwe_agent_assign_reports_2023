## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1191 | On-Chip Debug and Test Interface With Improper Access Control | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE.  The vulnerability is caused by **sensitive information** being accessible through physical probing of the JTAG interface without proper access control.|
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The **sensitive information** is accessible in cleartext. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-1191 (On-Chip Debug and Test Interface With Improper Access Control), a Base-level CWE. It is related to CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), which is a Pillar-level CWE. CWE-1191 is a child of CWE-284, indicating that it's a more specific type of access control issue related to debug interfaces. CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is also included because the information is accessible in cleartext.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain involves the following steps:
1.  **Root Cause:** The JTAG interface lacks proper access control (CWE-1191).
2.  **Weakness:** **Sensitive information** is accessible via physical probing.
3.  **Impact:** An unprivileged user can potentially enable information disclosure.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the lack of proper access control for the JTAG interface, which allows **sensitive information** to be accessed. The analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description, which states that "**sensitive information** accessible by physical probing of JTAG interface for some Intel(R) Processors with SGX may allow an unprivileged user to potentially enable information disclosure via physical access."

The graph relationships influenced the selection by showing that CWE-1191 is a specific type of improper access control (child of CWE-284), making it a more precise fit than the more general CWE-284.

CWE-1191 is selected because it directly addresses the weakness where the chip does not correctly perform access control to check whether users are authorized to access internal registers and test modes through the physical debug/test interface.

CWE-319 is added as a secondary weakness because the **sensitive information** is transmitted in cleartext.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately reflect the root cause (improper access control on the JTAG interface) and the nature of the data being transmitted (cleartext).

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. However, classification research is limited for weaknesses of this type, so there can be gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE that force use of this weakness, even at such a high level of abstraction.

*Not Selected*: This CWE is too high-level and doesn't accurately describe the specific weakness.

## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.

*Not Selected*: This CWE is too high-level and not relevant to the vulnerability.

## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: While there may be some overlap with isolation, the root cause is more related to access control of the JTAG interface.

## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected*: This CWE is not applicable as the vulnerability is due to lack of access control mechanisms, not unusual conditions.

## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.

*Not Selected*: This CWE is too generic and doesn't fit the specific scenario.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

*Not Selected*: This CWE is too high-level. CWE-1191 is a more specific and accurate representation of the weakness.

## CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.

*Not Selected*: Too high-level.

## CWE-1299: Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The lack of protections on alternate paths to access
                control-protected assets (such as unprotected shadow registers
                and other external facing unguarded interfaces) allows an
                attacker to bypass existing protections to the asset that are
		only performed against the primary path.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: While related, CWE-1191 is more specific to debug interfaces like JTAG.

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected*: Not relevant to the described vulnerability.

## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
