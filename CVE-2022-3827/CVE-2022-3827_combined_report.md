|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability is due to **lack of sanitization** of the `cg_id` argument leading to SQL injection. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is that CWE-89 (SQL Injection) is a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')). This parent-child relationship reflects that SQL injection is a specific type of injection vulnerability. While CWE-74 is a higher-level class, CWE-89 provides a more precise description of the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of sanitization** of the `cg_id` argument. This leads directly to the **SQL injection** vulnerability, which can allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the database.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly indicates an SQL injection vulnerability due to the **lack of sanitization** of the `cg_id` argument in the `formContactGroup.php` file. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the original code used direct SQL queries with string concatenation, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

The relationship graph shows that CWE-89 is a specific type of injection (CWE-74).

The selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an SQL command. The description states that the `$cg_id` variable was directly inserted into the SQL query without proper sanitization. The patch addresses this by using prepared statements with parameterized queries.

The evidence from the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section is very strong:
- "The original code used a direct SQL query with string concatenation, making it vulnerable to SQL injection. Specifically, the `$cg_id` variable was directly inserted into the SQL query without proper sanitization."
- "$DBRESULT = $pearDB->query("SELECT * FROM `contactgroup` WHERE `cg_id` = '" . $cg_id . "' LIMIT 1");"
- "An attacker could manipulate `$cg_id` to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized database operations."
- "The commit addresses the SQL injection vulnerability by using prepared statements with parameterized queries."

Other CWEs Considered:
- CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')): While neutralization is a factor, the vulnerability is specifically related to SQL commands, not web page generation.
- CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')): This is a parent class of CWE-89. Because SQL Injection is the specific issue, using CWE-89 is preferred.
- CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')): This CWE is too broad. The specific issue is SQL injection, not general code injection.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **lack of sanitization**
- **impact:** sql injection
- **vector:** manipulation of cg_id argument
- **product:** centreon
- **component:** Contact Groups Form (formContactGroup.php)

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the reported commit and its potential vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The original code used a direct SQL query with string concatenation, making it vulnerable to SQL injection. Specifically, the `$cg_id` variable was directly inserted into the SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The vulnerability lies in the use of the following line:
```php
$DBRESULT = $pearDB->query("SELECT * FROM `contactgroup` WHERE `cg_id` = '" . $cg_id . "' LIMIT 1");
```
   - Here, the `$cg_id` variable is concatenated directly into the SQL query string. An attacker could manipulate `$cg_id` to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized database operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the database.
- Potential to read sensitive data (e.g., contact group information).
- Potential to modify or delete database entries.
- Possible to escalate to broader system compromise depending on database permissions and the application's interaction with the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to manipulate the input that influences the `$cg_id` variable. This would likely be through a web form or API call where the `cg_id` parameter is user-controllable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit a manipulated value to the `$cg_id` parameter, suggesting that they likely need to be a user of the application who can interact with the vulnerable form. They do not necessarily need privileged access, but access to the form or API is a prerequisite.

**Mitigation:**
- The commit addresses the SQL injection vulnerability by using prepared statements with parameterized queries.
```php
$statement = $pearDB->prepare("SELECT * FROM `contactgroup` WHERE `cg_id` = :cg_id LIMIT 1");
$statement->bindValue(':cg_id', (int) $cg_id, \PDO::PARAM_INT);
$statement->execute();
```
   - Prepared statements prevent SQL injection by treating user inputs as data rather than executable code. The `bindValue()` function ensures that the `$cg_id` variable is treated as an integer and not as part of the SQL command.

**Additional Notes:**
- The change includes converting the `$cg_id` to an integer using `(int)` before binding it to the query. This adds another layer of protection in the event the attacker is able to bypass the prepared statement.
- This is a clear example of the importance of using parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.

**Summary:**

This commit fixes a SQL injection vulnerability in the `formContactGroup.php` file by switching from a direct SQL query with string concatenation to a prepared statement, which is the standard practice for preventing this kind of vulnerability.

## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

### Extended Description


Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:


  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.

  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.

  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.

  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.

  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.

  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.

There are three main kinds of XSS:

  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.

  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. 

  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. 

Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as "drive-by hacking."

In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.


### Alternative Terms
XSS: A common abbreviation for Cross-Site Scripting.
HTML Injection: Used as a synonym of stored (Type 2) XSS.
CSS: In the early years after initial discovery of XSS, "CSS" was a commonly-used acronym. However, this would cause confusion with "Cascading Style Sheets," so usage of this acronym has declined significantly.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

There can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.


**[Applicable Platform]** 

XSS flaws are very common in web applications, since they require a great deal of developer discipline to avoid them.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-25926:** Python Library Manager did not sufficiently neutralize a user-supplied search term, allowing reflected XSS.
- **CVE-2021-25963:** Python-based e-commerce platform did not escape returned content on error pages, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.
- **CVE-2021-1879:** Universal XSS in mobile operating system, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-1241: Use of Predictable Algorithm in Random Number Generator
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The device uses an algorithm that is predictable and generates a pseudo-random number.

### Extended Description


Pseudo-random number generator algorithms are predictable because their registers have a finite number of possible states, which eventually lead to repeating patterns. As a result, pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) can compromise their randomness or expose their internal state to various attacks, such as reverse engineering or tampering. It is highly recommended to use hardware-based true random number generators (TRNGs) to ensure the security of encryption schemes. TRNGs generate unpredictable, unbiased, and independent random numbers because they employ physical phenomena, e.g., electrical noise, as sources to generate random numbers.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, "randomness" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.

## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.

### Extended Description


 HTTP agents or components may include a web server, load balancer, reverse proxy, web caching proxy, application firewall, web browser, etc. Regardless of the role, they are expected to maintain coherent, consistent HTTP communication state across all components. However, including unexpected data in an HTTP header allows an attacker to specify the entirety of the HTTP message that is rendered by the client HTTP agent (e.g., web browser) or back-end HTTP agent (e.g., web server), whether the message is part of a request or a response. 


When an HTTP request contains unexpected CR and LF characters, the server may respond with an output stream that is interpreted as "splitting" the stream into two different HTTP messages instead of one. CR is carriage return, also given by %0d or \r, and LF is line feed, also given by %0a or \n.


In addition to CR and LF characters, other valid/RFC compliant special characters and unique character encodings can be utilized, such as HT (horizontal tab, also given by %09 or \t) and SP (space, also given as + sign or %20).


These types of unvalidated and unexpected data in HTTP message headers allow an attacker to control the second "split" message to mount attacks such as server-side request forgery, cross-site scripting, and cache poisoning attacks.


HTTP response splitting weaknesses may be present when:


  1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request.

  1. The data is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web user without neutralizing malicious characters that can be interpreted as separator characters for headers.

- **CVE-2018-12116:** Javascript-based framework allows request splitting through a path option of an HTTP request




## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.

### Extended Description


Many web applications use template engines that allow developers to insert externally-influenced values into free text or messages in order to generate a full web page, document, message, etc. Such engines include Twig, Jinja2, Pug, Java Server Pages, FreeMarker, Velocity, ColdFusion, Smarty, and many others - including PHP itself. Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.


Template engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression "{{7*7}}" and determine if the output returns "49" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.


In some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.


Template engines can be used on the server or client, so both "sides" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.


### Alternative Terms
Server-Side Template Injection / SSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a server.
Client-Side Template Injection / CSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a client.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Since expression languages are often used in templating languages, there may be some overlap with CWE-917 (Expression Language Injection). XSS (CWE-79) is also co-located with template injection.

**[Maintenance]** The interrelationships and differences between CWE-917 and CWE-1336 need to be further clarified.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-34359:** Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a "prompt injection" attack.
