The retriever results suggest that CWE-862 is a strong candidate. CWE-862 is a parent of more specific Base-level CWEs. While a more specific CWE would be ideal, the provided information does not give enough details to determine a better fit. CWE-668 [CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere] is also considered as a secondary CWE because information intended for a specific component/user might be exposed to others due to the **missing permission check**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing permission check** (CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization])\n2.  **Impact:** Local information disclosure (CWE-668 [CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere])\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focuses on the **missing permission check** as the root cause, leading to local information disclosure.\n\nThe evidence supporting the selection of CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization] is derived directly from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases,\" which identifies \"**missing permission check**\" as the root cause. This aligns precisely with the description of CWE-862, which states, \"The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-668 [CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere] is based on the vulnerability's impact, which is \"local information disclosure.\" This suggests that information intended for a specific component or user is being exposed to others due to the **missing authorization**.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization] is a child of CWE-285 [CWE-285: Improper Authorization], indicating a hierarchical relationship. While CWE-285 could be considered, CWE-862 is more specific to the **missing permission check**, making it a better fit.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause (**missing permission check**) and the resulting impact (local information disclosure). Further refinement may be possible with additional information.",
