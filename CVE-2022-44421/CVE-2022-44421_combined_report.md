## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **missing permission check** in the wlan driver, leading to potential information disclosure.
  - **Root Cause:** **Missing permission check** (CWE-280, CWE-862)
  - **Impact:** Information disclosure

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly states a **missing permission check** as the root cause, which could lead to local information disclosure in the wlan driver.

The primary CWE mapping is CWE-280 (Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges) because it precisely captures the essence of the vulnerability: the driver does not properly handle situations where it lacks the necessary permissions. The description of CWE-280 aligns well with the vulnerability.

CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) was also considered, as it is a more general case of a **missing permission check**. However, since the provided information specifies that the driver *does not handle* insufficient privileges, CWE-280 is a more accurate and specific classification.

The evidence supporting this decision comes directly from the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" section, which identifies "**missing permission check**" as the root cause.

Other CWEs Considered:
*   CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read): This is related to memory corruption, which is not indicated in the vulnerability description.
*   CWE-927 (Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication): This is Android-specific and not relevant to the wlan driver context.
*   CWE-253 (Incorrect Check of Function Return Value): The vulnerability description doesn't mention anything about return values.
*   CWE-909 (Missing Initialization of Resource): No indication of missing resource initialization.
*   CWE-170 (Improper Null Termination): This is a string manipulation issue, which is not indicated in the vulnerability description.
*   CWE-129 (Improper Validation of Array Index): Array indexing issues are not mentioned.
*   CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition): There is no mention of race conditions.
*   CWE-252 (Unchecked Return Value): No evidence to suggest unchecked return values.
*   CWE-754 (Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions): While a **missing permission check** is an exceptional condition, it is more precisely described by CWE-280.
*   CWE-1289 (Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input): Validation issues are not mentioned.
*   CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions): Too abstract.
*   CWE-667 (Improper Locking): Locking is not mentioned.
*   CWE-404 (Improper Resource Shutdown or Release): Resource shutdown/release is not mentioned.
*   CWE-226 (Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse): Not relevant to the description.
*   CWE-274 (Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges): Similar to CWE-280, but the description of CWE-280 is more appropriate.
*   CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')): Buffer overflows are not mentioned.
*   CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read): Out-of-bounds reads are not mentioned.
*   CWE-823 (Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset): Pointer issues are not mentioned.
*   CWE-908 (Use of Uninitialized Resource): No indication of uninitialized resources.
*   CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference): No mention of null pointers.
*   CWE-456 (Missing Initialization of a Variable): No evidence to suggest this.
*   CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read): No evidence to suggest this.
*   CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value): No evidence to suggest this.
*   CWE-617 (Reachable Assertion): No evidence to suggest this.

The final selection of CWE-280 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it clearly describes the **missing permission check** scenario and its potential impact.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-862: Missing Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-285
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information
- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.
- **CVE-2009-3597:** Web application stores database file under the web root with insufficient access control (CWE-219), allowing direct request.




## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.

### Extended Description
This typically occurs when the pointer or its index is incremented to a position beyond the bounds of the buffer or when pointer arithmetic results in a position outside of the valid memory location to name a few. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-125
ChildOf -> CWE-788

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** These problems may be resultant from missing sentinel values (CWE-463) or trusting a user-influenced input length variable.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-1733:** Text editor has out-of-bounds read past end of line while indenting C code
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated, leading to buffer over-read or heap-based buffer overflow.




## CWE-927: Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The Android application uses an implicit intent for transmitting sensitive data to other applications.

### Extended Description


Since an implicit intent does not specify a particular application to receive the data, any application can process the intent by using an Intent Filter for that intent. This can allow untrusted applications to obtain sensitive data. There are two variations on the standard broadcast intent, ordered and sticky.


Ordered broadcast intents are delivered to a series of registered receivers in order of priority as declared by the Receivers. A malicious receiver can give itself a high priority and cause a denial of service by stopping the broadcast from propagating further down the chain. There is also the possibility of malicious data modification, as a receiver may also alter the data within the Intent before passing it on to the next receiver. The downstream components have no way of asserting that the data has not been altered earlier in the chain.


Sticky broadcast intents remain accessible after the initial broadcast. An old sticky intent will be broadcast again to any new receivers that register for it in the future, greatly increasing the chances of information exposure over time. Also, sticky broadcasts cannot be protected by permissions that may apply to other kinds of intents.


In addition, any broadcast intent may include a URI that references data that the receiving component does not normally have the privileges to access. The sender of the intent can include special privileges that grant the receiver read or write access to the specific URI included in the intent. A malicious receiver that intercepts this intent will also gain those privileges and be able to read or write the resource at the specified URI.

## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not initialize a critical resource.

### Extended Description
Many resources require initialization before they can be properly used. If a resource is not initialized, it could contain unpredictable or expired data, or it could be initialized to defaults that are invalid. This can have security implications when the resource is expected to have certain properties or values.

- **CVE-2005-1036:** Chain: Bypass of access restrictions due to improper authorization (CWE-862) of a user results from an improperly initialized (CWE-909) I/O permission bitmap




## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges 
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** CWE-280 and CWE-274 are too similar. It is likely that CWE-274 will be deprecated in the future.

**[Relationship]** This can be both primary and resultant. When primary, it can expose a variety of weaknesses because a resource might not have the expected state, and subsequent operations might fail. It is often resultant from Unchecked Error Condition (CWE-391).

**[Theoretical]** Within the context of vulnerability theory, privileges and permissions are two sides of the same coin. Privileges are associated with actors, and permissions are associated with resources. To perform access control, at some point the software makes a decision about whether the actor (and the privileges that have been assigned to that actor) is allowed to access the resource (based on the permissions that have been specified for that resource).

**[Research Gap]** This type of issue is under-studied, since researchers often concentrate on whether an object has too many permissions, instead of not enough. These weaknesses are likely to appear in environments with fine-grained models for permissions and privileges, which can include operating systems and other large-scale software packages. However, even highly simplistic permission/privilege models are likely to contain these issues if the developer has not considered the possibility of access failure.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2003-0501:** Special file system allows attackers to prevent ownership/permission change of certain entries by opening the entries before calling a setuid program.
- **CVE-2004-0148:** FTP server places a user in the root directory when the user's permissions prevent access to the their own home directory.




## CWE-170: Improper Null Termination
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not terminate or incorrectly terminates a string or array with a null character or equivalent terminator.

### Extended Description
Null termination errors frequently occur in two different ways. An off-by-one error could cause a null to be written out of bounds, leading to an overflow. Or, a program could use a strncpy() function call incorrectly, which prevents a null terminator from being added at all. Other scenarios are possible.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-707
CanPrecede -> CWE-120
CanPrecede -> CWE-126
CanAlsoBe -> CWE-147
PeerOf -> CWE-464
PeerOf -> CWE-463
ChildOf -> CWE-20

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Factors: this is usually resultant from other weaknesses such as off-by-one errors, but it can be primary to boundary condition violations such as buffer overflows. In buffer overflows, it can act as an expander for assumed-immutable data.

**[Relationship]** Overlaps missing input terminator.

**[Applicable Platform]** 

Conceptually, this does not just apply to the C language; any language or representation that involves a terminator could have this type of problem.


**[Maintenance]** As currently described, this entry is more like a category than a weakness.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2000-0312:** Attacker does not null-terminate argv[] when invoking another program.
- **CVE-2003-0777:** Interrupted step causes resultant lack of null termination.
- **CVE-2004-1072:** Fault causes resultant lack of null termination, leading to buffer expansion.




## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
out-of-bounds array index
index-out-of-range
array index underflow

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1285
ChildOf -> CWE-20
CanPrecede -> CWE-119
CanPrecede -> CWE-823
CanPrecede -> CWE-789

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness can precede uncontrolled memory allocation (CWE-789) in languages that automatically expand an array when an index is used that is larger than the size of the array, such as JavaScript.

**[Theoretical]** An improperly validated array index might lead directly to the always-incorrect behavior of "access of array using out-of-bounds index."



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-0369:** large ID in packet used as array index
- **CVE-2001-1009:** negative array index as argument to POP LIST command
- **CVE-2003-0721:** Integer signedness error leads to negative array index




## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.

### Extended Description
This weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.

### Alternative Terms
TOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to "Time Of Check To Time Of Use".
TOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-362
ChildOf -> CWE-362

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** TOCTOU issues do not always involve symlinks, and not every symlink issue is a TOCTOU problem.

**[Research Gap]** Non-symlink TOCTOU issues are not reported frequently, but they are likely to occur in code that attempts to be secure.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2015-1743:** TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed
- **CVE-2003-0813:** A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.
- **CVE-2004-0594:** PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.




## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.

### Extended Description
Two common programmer assumptions are "this function call can never fail" and "it doesn't matter if this function call fails". If an attacker can force the function to fail or otherwise return a value that is not expected, then the subsequent program logic could lead to a vulnerability, because the product is not in a state that the programmer assumes. For example, if the program calls a function to drop privileges but does not check the return code to ensure that privileges were successfully dropped, then the program will continue to operate with the higher privileges.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-754
ChildOf -> CWE-754
CanPrecede -> CWE-476

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-17533:** Chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) of some functions for policy enforcement leads to authorization bypass (CWE-862)
- **CVE-2020-6078:** Chain: The return value of a function returning a pointer is not checked for success (CWE-252) resulting in the later use of an uninitialized variable (CWE-456) and a null pointer dereference (CWE-476)
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
