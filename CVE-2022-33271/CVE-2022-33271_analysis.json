The description states: \"Information disclosure due to **buffer over-read** in WLAN while parsing NMF frame.\" CWE-126's description states: \"The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\" This directly matches the vulnerability details.
