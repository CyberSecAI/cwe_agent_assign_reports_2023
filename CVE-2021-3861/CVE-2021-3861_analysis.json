CWE-119 is a Class that is a parent of both CWE-120 and CWE-787. CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size) is a Base CWE and a child of CWE-119. These relationships indicate that the vulnerability is a specific type of buffer overflow (heap-based) and is caused by not checking the size of the input when copying data to a buffer. The choice of CWE-122 is driven by the evidence indicating a heap-based overflow.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size\"]\n    \n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe122 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe120 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of bounds checking** when copying data into a fixed-size buffer, leading to a **heap-based buffer overflow**, which can then lead to **corruption of data structures** and potentially **arbitrary code execution**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which includes a clear description of the **buffer overflow** vulnerability in the RNDIS USB device class. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section confirms the **root cause** as the **lack of bounds checking** in the `memcpy` operation within the `queue_encapsulated_cmd` function. The code uses `net_buf_simple_add` which only increments the buffer length but does not check whether the buffer has sufficient space.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by showing the connection between different types of buffer overflows. CWE-122 is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-122 directly describes a heap-based buffer overflow, which is the core of the vulnerability. While CWE-119 is a more general category, CWE-122 provides a more precise classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as
