The description clearly indicates a **missing permission check**, which directly aligns with the concept of missing authorization, making CWE-862 a more specific and appropriate choice than its parent, CWE-285.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe280[\"CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe280 -->|CHILDOF| cwe755\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe280 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission check** (CWE-862), which leads to a local denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description clearly states \"**missing permission check**\", which directly corresponds to the concept of missing authorization. The Retriever Results also indicated CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and CWE-280 (Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges) as relevant.\n\nCWE-862 (Missing Authorization) was chosen as the primary CWE because it accurately reflects the root cause. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **missing permission check**, which aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-862.\n\nCWE-280 (Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges) was considered as a secondary CWE because the **missing permission check** can be viewed as a case where the system does not properly handle the scenario where the user lacks the necessary permissions.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause and its potential consequences.

The vulnerability description states the check is completely missing, which is a more accurate fit for CWE-862.",
