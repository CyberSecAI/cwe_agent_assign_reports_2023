The secondary CWE is CWE-400 (**Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**), a **Class** level weakness, which describes the impact of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1287[\"CWE-1287: Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe1287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe400 -->|IMPACT| cwe1287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1287 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  The application receives a specially-crafted HTTP request.\n2.  The `cgiserver.cgi` JSON command parser **fails to validate the type** of the \"param\" field, assuming it is always an object (CWE-1287).\n3.  The code attempts to access the \"param\" field as an object using the subscription operator, which leads to an assertion failure and process termination.\n4.  The `cgiserver.cgi` process terminates, leading to a device reboot, resulting in a denial of service (CWE-400).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-1287 (**Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input**), supported by the following evidence:\n*   The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states: \"The root cause is the **improper input validation** in the `cgiserver.cgi` JSON command parser. Specifically, the code assumes that the \"param\" JSON element will always be an object, but this is not always the case.\"\n*   The description for CWE-1287 states: \"The product receives input that is expected to be of a certain type, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually of the expected type.\"\n*   The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states: \"The `cgiserver.cgi` does not properly validate the type of the JSON element provided for the \"param\" key. It assumes that the \"param\" value is always an object.\"\n*   CWE-1287 is a **Base** level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\nThe secondary weakness is CWE-400 (**Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**), supported by the following evidence:\n*   The vulnerability description states: \"**A denial of service vulnerability exists**\"\n*   The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states: \"An attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the camera, resulting in a reboot.\"\n*   CWE-400 is a **Class** level CWE, and per mapping guidelines, should be replaced with a **Base** level CWE. However, there is no **Base** level CWE that matches more closely.\n\nCWE-20 (**Improper Input Validation**) was considered, as it is the parent of CWE-1287. However, CWE-1287 is a more specific **Base** level CWE that describes the vulnerability, so it is preferred.",
