CWE-201 is a more specific instance of CWE-200, where sensitive information is specifically inserted into sent data. The vulnerability description clearly states that `.onion` URLs are leaked in the Referer and Origin headers, indicating an insertion of sensitive information into sent data. The relationship between CWE-200 and CWE-201 influenced the selection of CWE-201 as the primary CWE because it is at the Base level of abstraction and is more specific than CWE-200.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling** of Referer and Origin headers, leading to the **insertion of sensitive information** (.onion URLs) into sent data (CWE-201), which then results in the **exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized actors** (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified several potential CWEs, including CWE-200, CWE-359, and CWE-201. However, after carefully reviewing the vulnerability description and the CWE specifications, it became clear that CWE-201 is the most appropriate primary CWE.\n\nThe vulnerability description states that Brave browser, before version 1.34, leaked .onion URLs in the Referer and Origin headers when a Private Window with Tor Connectivity is used. The **root cause** of the vulnerability is the **improper handling of Referer and Origin headers**, which leads to the **insertion of sensitive information** (.onion URLs) into sent data. This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-201, which states: \"The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\"\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section reinforces this conclusion by stating: \"Specifically, the browser was not omitting the `Referer` header and was not sending a `null` value for the `Origin` header (when present), as expected for cross-origin requests from `.onion` origins.\" This evidence supports the assertion that sensitive information was being inserted into sent data due to the improper handling of headers.\n\nCWE-200 was considered as a secondary CWE because the insertion of sensitive information into sent data ultimately leads to the exposure of that information to unauthorized actors. However, CWE-200 is a broader, more general CWE, and CWE-201 is a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability's root cause.\n\nThe selection of CWE-201 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the insertion of sensitive information into sent data due to the improper handling of headers. This level of specificity is preferred because it allows for more targeted mitigation strategies.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
