CWE-36 is a specific type of CWE-22.\nCWE-73 **External Control of File Name or Path** can precede CWE-36, because external control of a filename or path is often a prerequisite for path traversal vulnerabilities.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe36[\"CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    \n    cwe36 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe36\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe36 primary\n    class cwe22,cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **external control** of a file name or path (CWE-73), leading to the **improper neutralization of absolute path sequences**, resulting in **absolute path traversal** (CWE-36).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **absolute path traversal** as the root cause, supported by the vulnerability description and the summary of CVE reference links.\nThe evidence provided in the vulnerability description is that the zippies/testplatform repository through 2016-07-19 on GitHub allows **absolute path traversal** because the Flask send_file function is used unsafely.\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"The primary vulnerability across all these CVEs stems from the insecure use of the `flask.send_file` function within Flask web applications. This function, when used improperly, is susceptible to *absolute path traversal* attacks.\"\n\nThe relationship analysis confirmed that CWE-36 is a specific type of path traversal, making it more appropriate than its parent CWE-22.\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-36 directly addresses the **absolute path traversal** issue, while CWE-73 highlights the external control aspect.\n\nI am overriding the retriever results which ranked CWE-22 as the primary, because the vulnerability description is very clear that this is **absolute path traversal**, which makes CWE-36 the best fit.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
