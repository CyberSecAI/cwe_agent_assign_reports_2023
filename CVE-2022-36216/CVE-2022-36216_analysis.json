CWE-96 is also a child of CWE-94. The selection of CWE-95 as the primary is based on the fact that the code is being dynamically evaluated.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe95[\"CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\"]\n    cwe96[\"CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe95 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe96 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe95 primary\n    class cwe96,cwe94 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient input sanitization** of the `id` parameter, followed by the use of `_RunMagicQuotes` which modifies the input, then the use of `json_encode` which escapes the modified input, ultimately leading to **improper neutralization of directives in dynamically evaluated code (CWE-95)** and resulting in **remote code execution**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered multiple CWEs, but after careful review of the vulnerability description and the relationships between CWEs, the most appropriate primary CWE is CWE-95. This is because the vulnerability specifically involves the dynamic evaluation of code based on user-supplied input.\n\nThe evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" clearly states that the vulnerability arises from insufficient sanitization of the `id` parameter, which is then used to generate PHP code. The `_RunMagicQuotes` function and `json_encode` contribute to the problem by modifying and escaping the input, but the core issue is that the application dynamically evaluates this user-controlled input, leading to code injection.\n\nThe choice of CWE-95 is further supported by the \"Retriever Results,\" which lists CWE-95 as a relevant CWE with a high score, and the CWE description explicitly mentions the improper neutralization of code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g., \"eval\").\n\nThe abstraction level of CWE-95 (Variant) is also appropriate, as it is a more specific case of CWE-94 (Base), and the vulnerability description provides sufficient evidence to warrant this more specific classification.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence provided, the relationships between CWEs, the mapping guidance, and the abstraction level. CWE-95 accurately represents the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **improper neutralization** of user-supplied input before it is dynamically evaluated, leading to code injection and remote code execution.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTwo separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
