CWE-79 is a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')). CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output) is a Class-level CWE that highlights the **missing or incorrect encoding/escaping** of data, contributing to the XSS vulnerability. CWE-116 is a child of CWE-707 and can precede CWE-74.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n    cwe707[\"CWE-707: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\"]\n\n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe116 -->|CHILDOF| cwe707\n    cwe116 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe116,cwe707 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper sanitization of SVG files** (root cause), which leads to the possibility of injecting malicious code. This malicious code, when included in a web page, results in **cross-site scripting (XSS)**. The chain can be represented as: **Improper SVG Sanitization** -> **Improper Encoding/Escaping of Output** -> **Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identifies the vulnerability as Cross-site Scripting in Packagist pimcore/pimcore prior to 10.3.1. The commit message \"Svg sanitization (#11386)\" and the changes made in `AssetSanitizationListener.php`, `SettingsController.php`, and `composer.json` strongly suggest that this commit is a fix for a vulnerability related to unsanitized SVG uploads, which could potentially lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other security issues. The primary CWE is CWE-79, as the vulnerability directly results from the **improper neutralization of input** (malicious SVG content) during web page generation. The supporting evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating the **root cause** as \"the **lack of proper sanitization of SVG files** uploaded through Pimcore.\"\n\nCWE-116 is considered a secondary candidate because the fix involves sanitizing the SVG content, which can be seen as a form of encoding or escaping the output to prevent the malicious code from being executed. However, CWE-79 is a more direct representation of the vulnerability's impact, which is XSS.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-79 being a base-level CWE and CWE-116 being a class-level CWE. These levels provide a good balance between detail and generality, accurately capturing the nature of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- **CWE-79:** Directly addresses the XSS vulnerability resulting from improper neutralization of input.\n- **CWE-116:** Addresses the aspect of improper encoding or escaping of output, which contributes to the XSS vulnerability.\n- **CWE-83:** Considered but not used. While it relates to script in attributes, the primary issue is the overall lack of neutralization leading to XSS, making CWE-79 more appropriate.\n- **CWE-80:** Considered but not used. It relates to script-related HTML tags, but the issue is broader than just HTML tags, encompassing SVG content.\n- **CWE-352:** Considered but not used. This is about Cross-Site Request Forgery, and there's no evidence of that attack vector here.",
