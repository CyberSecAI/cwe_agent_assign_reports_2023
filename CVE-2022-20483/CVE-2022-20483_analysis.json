CWE-190 is a ChildOf CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) and CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation). CWE-125 is a ChildOf CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe682[\"CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe125\n    cwe190 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe190 -->|CHILDOF| cwe682\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe125 secondary\n    class cwe20,cwe682,cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow** (CWE-190), which subsequently leads to an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125). The root cause is the integer overflow, and the direct consequence is the out-of-bounds read, leading to remote information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, key phrases, and CVE reference summary provided. The vulnerability involves an **integer overflow** leading to an **out-of-bounds read**, resulting in potential information disclosure.\n\nEvidence:\n- Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:\n  - **rootcause:** **integer overflows**\n  - **weakness:** **out of bounds reads**\n  - **impact:** remote information disclosure\n- CVE Reference Links Content Summary:\n  - \"Root cause of vulnerability\": \"Integer overflow when parsing AVRCP response due to the use of 16-bit min_len, which was changed to 32-bits to avoid the overflow.\"\n  - \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present\": \"Integer overflow\"\n  - \"Impact of exploitation\": \"Information disclosure due to possible length checking overflow.\"\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) because the root cause of the vulnerability is an integer overflow. The secondary CWE is CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) because the integer overflow leads to an out-of-bounds read. Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction. This assessment aligns with the provided evidence and the relationships between CWEs. The selection of CWEs is at the optimal level of specificity, representing the root cause and its direct consequence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs

5610.10\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may\n         become a very small or negative number.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n-",
