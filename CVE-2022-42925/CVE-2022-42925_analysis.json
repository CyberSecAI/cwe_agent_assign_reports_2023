CWE-434 has peer relationships with CWE-430 and CWE-436, indicating other potential file handling issues. It can also follow CWE-184, suggesting that an incomplete denylist might lead to unrestricted uploads. CWE-862 is a class-level CWE which is higher abstraction.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    cwe184[\"CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe430[\"CWE-430: Deployment of Wrong Handler\"]\n    cwe436[\"CWE-436: Unvalidated Immediately Invoked Function\"]\n\n    cwe434 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe184\n    cwe434 --o|PEEROF| cwe430\n    cwe434 --o|PEEROF| cwe436\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| CWE-285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    CWE-285 -->|CHILDOF| CWE-284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe434 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with an authenticated attacker (student role) exploiting a missing authorization check (potential CWE-862), leading to the ability to upload a zip file. This zip file, due to the **unrestricted upload of dangerous file types** (CWE-434), leads to remote code injection.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed towards CWE-434 due to the mention of uploading a zip file leading to remote code injection. The retriever results also listed CWE-434 as the top candidate.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"There is a vulnerability on Forma LMS version 3.1.0 and earlier that could allow an authenticated attacker (with the role of student) to privilege escalate in order to upload a Zip file through the plugin upload component. The exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a remote code injection.\"\n\nThis aligns with CWE-434: \"The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\"\n\nThe fact that a student role can upload a zip file through the plugin upload component suggests a **missing authorization** check, making CWE-862 a potential secondary candidate. However, the primary issue is the unrestricted upload leading to remote code injection.\n\nCWE-434 is the most specific and appropriate CWE, as it directly addresses the **unrestricted upload of a dangerous file type** (zip file) that leads to remote code injection. CWE-862 is considered as a secondary candidate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
