While **improper input sanitization** is indicated in the description, CWE-20 is too general and is discouraged.\n\nBased on the evidence, CWE-89 is the most appropriate and specific CWE for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:\n  - **rootcause:** **Improper input sanitization**\n  - **weakness:** **SQL injection**\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence. The evidence explicitly states \"SQL Injection vulnerability\" and \"**Improper input sanitization**\", which strongly supports the selection of CWE-89. The graph relationships confirm that CWE-89 is a specific type of injection, making it more appropriate than a general input validation weakness (CWE-20). The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the SQL injection vulnerability, unlike the more general CWE-20.",
