The vulnerability allows an authenticated user to upload a zip file, which can lead to remote code injection. |\n| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability involves an authenticated user (student) being able to upload a file through the SCORM importer. This implies that the user has **insufficient authorization** to access this feature. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness, CWE-434, is at the Base level. It describes the **unrestricted upload** of a dangerous file type, specifically a zip file in this case. The secondary weakness, CWE-862, is a Class-level CWE that describes **missing authorization**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe434 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n    class cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **missing authorization** (CWE-862), which allows an authenticated user (student) to access the SCORM importer feature. This leads to an **unrestricted upload** of a dangerous file type (CWE-434), which can then lead to remote code injection.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which states that an authenticated attacker with the role of student can **privilege escalate** to upload a Zip file, leading to remote code injection.\n\nThe provided retriever results suggest CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) as the top candidate. This aligns with the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions the ability to upload a Zip file. The description of CWE-434 states: \"The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\" This is exactly what the vulnerability description outlines, making it a strong candidate.\n\nThe retriever results also suggest CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), which is a Class-level CWE. This CWE describes a situation where \"The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\" In this case, a student is able to access the SCORM importer feature, which they should not have access to.\n\nI have chosen to represent this as a primary CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) and secondary CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).\nCWE-434 is the more direct cause of the remote code injection.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
