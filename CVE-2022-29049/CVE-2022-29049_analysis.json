The secondary CWEs, CWE-73 and CWE-116, can be related to how this **lack of validation** can lead to external control of file names or improper encoding/escaping, ultimately resulting in XSS or other exploits.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe20\n    cwe116 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe73,cwe116 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of input validation** (CWE-20), which allows an attacker to inject malicious input. This **unsafe input** can then lead to external control of file names or paths (CWE-73), or it can cause improper encoding/escaping of output (CWE-116), ultimately leading to vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability stems from the Jenkins promoted builds Plugin **not validating the names of promotions defined in Job DSL**. This **lack of validation** allows attackers with Job/Configure permissions to create promotions with unsafe names, potentially leading to XSS attacks or `config.xml` file replacement.\n\nThe initial assessment points to **improper input validation** as the primary weakness, represented by CWE-20. The description clearly states that the plugin **does not validate the names of promotions**. This aligns with CWE-20's focus on the **failure to validate input**.\n\nThe following evidence from the provided content was essential to mapping decision:\n*   Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: \"**rootcause:** **does not validate the names of promotions defined in Job DSL**\"\n*   CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"The `promoted builds` plugin **does not validate the names of promotions** defined using the `Job DSL` plugin.\"\n*   CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"**Insufficient input validation**\"\n\nCWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) is considered a secondary CWE. While the vulnerability description focuses on the **lack of validation** rather than direct manipulation of file names, the CVE Reference Links Content Summary mentions \"potential for `config.xml` file replacement,\" suggesting that the **unsafe names** could be used to manipulate file paths indirectly.\n\nCWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output) is another secondary CWE. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary mentions \"Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability\" as a potential impact, implying that the **unsafe names** are not properly encoded or escaped when they are used in the application's output.\n\nCWE-862, CWE-285, and CWE-863 were considered but were not deemed as good a fit as CWE-20. While authorization is involved, the root cause is the **lack of input validation**, which precedes and enables potential authorization bypass issues. The focus is on the initial **failure to validate the input**, not the authorization mechanism itself.\nCWE-256 and CWE-522 were related to credential storage, which wasn't relevant to the vulnerability description.\nCWE-379 and CWE-276 were related to file permissions, which wasn't relevant to the vulnerability description.\nCWE-424 was related to protecting alternate paths, which wasn't relevant to the vulnerability description.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-20 captures the root cause, while CWE-73 and CWE-116 represent potential consequences or related weaknesses that could be exploited due to the **lack of validation**.",
