CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) is a related CWE because external control of the file name or path often precedes path traversal vulnerabilities.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe23[\"CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n\n    cwe23 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe23\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe23 primary\n    class cwe22,cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the external control of the file name or path (CWE-73), followed by the **relative path traversal** (CWE-23), leading to the ability to read and write files on the underlying Linux system.\n  - The root cause is **relative path traversal**\n  - The impact is reading and writing files\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is a **relative path traversal** vulnerability, allowing an attacker to read and write files on the underlying Linux system. This assessment is heavily based on the provided evidence, specifically the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" which explicitly states \"**rootcause:** **relative path traversal**\" and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which states \"The vulnerability is a relative path traversal (CWE-23), allowing attackers to navigate outside the intended directory.\"\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-23 is a child of CWE-22, but CWE-23 is more specific and directly applicable to the vulnerability description. CWE-73 can precede CWE-23, which means that external control of the file name or path can lead to a relative path traversal vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the **root cause** of the vulnerability. CWE-23 (Relative Path Traversal) is a Base level CWE and precisely describes the vulnerability, and CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) describes how the attacker can specify a path that is used in an operation on the filesystem.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
