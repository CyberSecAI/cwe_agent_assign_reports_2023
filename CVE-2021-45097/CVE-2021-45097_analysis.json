It has parent relationship to CWE-285 Improper Authorization and CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere. CWE-552 is a child of CWE-668 and CWE-285. CWE-256 is a child of CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials. The relationships show a hierarchy from general authorization issues down to specific instances of incorrect permissions and exposure of sensitive data. The choice of CWE-732 is influenced by its specific focus on critical resources, making it more relevant than broader authorization categories.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe552[\"CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    \n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe552 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe552 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe732 primary\n    class cwe552,cwe256 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect permission assignment** (CWE-732) for the file containing the administrator password. This leads to the **exposure of the password** to local users (CWE-552), and the fact that it's a **plaintext password** increases the risk (CWE-256). The root cause is the initial misconfiguration of file permissions, which then has a cascading effect.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The key evidence is the statement that the \"administrator's password is saved in a file **without appropriate file access controls**,\" which allows local users to read it.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting how a broader authorization issue can lead to specific vulnerabilities related to resource access. CWE-732 was chosen as the primary CWE because it focuses on the **incorrect permission assignment** for a critical resource (the password file). While CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) are relevant, CWE-732 is more specific.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately describe the **root cause** (CWE-732) and the immediate consequences (**exposure of sensitive information** - CWE-552 and **plaintext storage** - CWE-256). They provide a clear picture of the vulnerability and its potential impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
