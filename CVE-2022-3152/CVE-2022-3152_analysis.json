This means CWE-620 is a more specific case of weak authentication. CWE-472 (External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter) is related to CWE-642 (External Control of Critical State Data) and CWE-471 (Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data). These relationships indicate that the vulnerability involves manipulating data assumed to be immutable. The abstraction levels are appropriate, with both selected CWEs at the Base level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe620[\"CWE-620: Unverified Password Change\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe472[\"CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\"]\n    cwe642[\"CWE-642: External Control of Critical State Data\"]\n    cwe471[\"CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)\"]\n    \n    cwe620 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe472 -->|CHILDOF| cwe642\n    cwe472 -->|CHILDOF| cwe471\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe620 primary\n    class cwe472 secondary\n    class cwe1390,cwe642,cwe471 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of weaknesses begins with **insufficient input validation** of user-controlled parameters (`user_hash`, `user_id`). This leads to the ability to perform an **Unverified Password Change** (CWE-620) and can be viewed as **External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter** (CWE-472) since the application does not sufficiently verify the `user_hash` and `user_id` that should be immutable. The final impact is unauthorized modification of user profiles, potentially leading to privilege escalation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **Unverified Password Change** as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description and retriever results. The analysis of the CVE reference links content summary confirms that the vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of `user_hash` and `user_id` parameters, allowing attackers to modify another user's profile. This aligns with the description of CWE-620, where the product does not require knowledge of the original password or another form of authentication when setting a new password. Additionally, the ability to manipulate hidden form fields to change user information makes CWE-472 a relevant secondary weakness.\n\nThe selection of CWE-620 is based on the explicit mention of \"**Unverified Password Change**\" in the vulnerability description and its high ranking in the retriever results. The CVE reference links content summary provides further evidence, stating that the code \"**failed to properly verify that the `user_hash` and `user_id` parameters submitted by the user matched the existing user's data.**\"\n\nCWE-472 is included as a secondary weakness because the attacker manipulates `user_hash` and `user_id` via hidden form fields. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" mentions \"**Hidden Input Tampering:** The vulnerability allowed an attacker to manipulate hidden form fields related to user authentication (`user_hash`, `user_id`).\"\n\nOther CWEs were considered but not selected because they were either too general (e.g., CWE-285, CWE-1390) or did not directly address the root cause of the vulnerability as effectively as CWE-620 and CWE-472. For instance, CWE-836 (Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication) is not relevant since the vulnerability does not involve using a password hash instead of a password for authentication.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they accurately represent the root cause of the vulnerability (CWE-620) and a contributing factor (CWE-472) without being overly broad or abstract.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root",
