It is related to information exposure due to uncleared debug information. This CWE fits the vulnerability description, which mentions information disclosure while the GPU reads data. The alternative CWEs considered, such as out-of-bounds read/write or untrusted pointer dereference, are related to memory corruption issues, but they do not directly address the specific problem of sensitive information exposure via debug information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1258[\"CWE-1258: Exposure of Sensitive System Information Due to Uncleared Debug Information\"]\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe1258 -->|CHILDOF| cwe212\n    cwe1258 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1258 primary\n    class cwe212,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward. The hardware does not clear sensitive information in debug mode, leading to information disclosure.\n  - Root cause: Hardware **does not fully clear security-sensitive values** when debug mode is entered.\n  - Impact: **Information Disclosure** due to exposure of data while GPU reads it.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **impact** of **information disclosure** and the potential root causes. Based on the provided vulnerability description, the most relevant CWE is CWE-1258.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states \"Information disclosure due to exposure of information while GPU reads the data\". The key phrase is the exposure of information, and CWE-1258 addresses this by focusing on the uncleared debug information.\n\nCWE-1258's description states: \"The hardware does not fully clear security-sensitive values, such as keys and intermediate values in cryptographic operations, when debug mode is entered.\" This aligns well with the vulnerability description's implication that sensitive information is being exposed during GPU data reads, likely during debug mode.\n\nThe other CWEs, such as CWE-126, CWE-822, CWE-1314, CWE-823, CWE-367, CWE-787, CWE-390, CWE-459, and CWE-415 are less relevant because they focus on memory corruption, race conditions, or resource management issues, rather than the direct exposure of sensitive information due to debug information not being cleared.\n\nTherefore, CWE-1258 is the most specific and appropriate mapping for this vulnerability, and it is at the base level of abstraction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25
