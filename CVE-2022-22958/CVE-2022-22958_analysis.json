There are parent-child relationships to CWE-913 and peer relationships to CWE-915, indicating related weaknesses involving object modification and dynamically determined object attributes. However, the description explicitly mentions **deserialization of untrusted data** making CWE-502 the most direct and specific mapping. The child relationships suggest potential follow-on weaknesses related to code execution or data manipulation after deserialization, but these are not explicitly detailed in the description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Determined Object\"]\n    cwe915[\"CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes\"]\n    \n    cwe502 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    cwe502 -->|PEEROF| cwe915\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe502 primary\n    class cwe913,cwe915 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **deserialization of untrusted data** (CWE-502) via a malicious JDBC URI, which leads to remote code execution. The root cause is the lack of proper validation or sanitization of the data being deserialized.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points to CWE-502 as the primary weakness, given the explicit mention of \"**deserialization of untrusted data**\" in both the vulnerability description and CVE reference links. The retriever results also list CWE-502 as the top candidate.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"A malicious actor with administrative access can trigger **deserialization of untrusted data** through malicious JDBC URI which may result in remote code execution.\"\n\nThe evidence provided directly supports the selection of CWE-502. The graph relationships indicate potential follow-on effects (object modification), but the primary weakness is clearly the **deserialization of untrusted data**. The CWE-502 entry is at the Base level, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\nThe selection of CWE-502 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the **root cause** described in the vulnerability. Other CWEs, such as CWE-74 ('Injection'), are more general and less precise than CWE-502 in this context.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names.
