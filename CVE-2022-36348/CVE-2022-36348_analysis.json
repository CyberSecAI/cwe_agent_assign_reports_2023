Both are base-level CWEs. The presence of active debug code (CWE-489) increases the likelihood that sensitive information might be inadvertently included, potentially leading to its exposure (CWE-215).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe489[\"CWE-489: Active Debug Code\"]\n    cwe215[\"CWE-215: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Debugging Code\"]\n    cwe710[\"CWE-710: Improper Adherence to Coding Standards\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe489 -->|CHILDOF| cwe710\n    cwe215 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe489 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe215\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe489 primary\n    class cwe215 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause** of **Active debug code** (CWE-489). This **weakness** can then potentially lead to the inclusion of Sensitive Information Into Debugging Code (CWE-215), which in turn can result in Exposure of Sensitive Information (CWE-200) and finally to the impact of Escalation of Privilege.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the presence of **Active debug code** as the primary **root cause**. The vulnerability description clearly states: \"**Active debug code** in some Intel (R) SPS firmware before version SPS_E5_04.04.04.300.0 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.\"\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" reinforces this: \"The vulnerability is due to active debug code present in some Intel\u00ae Server Platform Services (SPS) firmware\" and \"Presence of active debug code in the firmware.\"\n\nCWE-489 (Active Debug Code) is a Base level CWE and is ALLOWED. This is the most direct and specific representation of the **root cause** described.\n\nCWE-215 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Debugging Code) was considered as a secondary CWE because active debug code might lead to sensitive information being inadvertently included in the code. While not explicitly stated, it's a plausible consequence.\n\nThe decision to include CWE-489 as the primary CWE is strongly supported by the evidence and the mapping guidance. The inclusion of CWE-215 as a secondary CWE is based on a potential, but not explicitly stated, consequence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
