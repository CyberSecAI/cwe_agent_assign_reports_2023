## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-256, which is a Base level CWE indicating that passwords are stored in plaintext. CWE-522 is a Class level CWE, which is a parent of CWE-256, representing insufficiently protected credentials. CWE-260 is a Base level CWE, and also a ChildOf CWE-522, related to passwords stored in configuration files. The vulnerability clearly states passwords are stored unencrypted, thus CWE-256 is the most specific and appropriate choice.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain involves the **unencrypted storage of sensitive information** (passwords) in job configuration files, leading to the potential exposure of these passwords to unauthorized users who have either Extended Read permissions within Jenkins or direct access to the Jenkins controller's file system.
  - **Root Cause:** **Unencrypted storage of sensitive information** (CWE-256)
  - **Weakness:** Passwords stored in `config.xml` files (CWE-260)
  - **Impact:** Exposure of passwords to unauthorized users.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the storage of passwords in plaintext. The vulnerability description clearly states this: "Jenkins Convertigo Mobile Platform Plugin 1.1 and earlier **stores passwords unencrypted** in job config.xml files". The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" also confirms this: "The Convertigo Mobile Platform Plugin **stores passwords unencrypted** in job `config.xml` files" and "**Passwords are stored in plain text**".

Based on this evidence, CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) was selected as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause. Other CWEs, such as CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) and CWE-260 (Password in Configuration File), were considered as secondary CWEs because they are related to the issue but are not as specific as CWE-256. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-256 is a child of CWE-522, indicating a hierarchical relationship where CWE-256 is a more specific case of CWE-522.

The mapping guidance for CWE-256 states that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level, and that it is ALLOWED for mapping. This further supports the decision to select CWE-256 as the primary CWE.

The final decision is based on the provided evidence and relationship analysis, ensuring that the selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity and accurately represents the root cause of the vulnerability.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.

### Extended Description
Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Depending on usage, this could be a weakness or a category. Further study of all its children is needed, and the entire sub-tree may need to be clarified. The current organization is based primarily on the exposure of sensitive information as a consequence, instead of as a primary weakness.

**[Maintenance]** There is a close relationship with CWE-552, which is more focused on weaknesses. As a result, it may be more appropriate to convert CWE-538 to a category.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.


Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.


When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to "sniff" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29519:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends sensitive information in plaintext, including passwords and session tokens.
- **CVE-2022-30312:** Building Controller uses a protocol that transmits authentication credentials in plaintext.
- **CVE-2022-31204:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends password in plaintext.




## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.
