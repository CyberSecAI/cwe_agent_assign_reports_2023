This is a base level CWE. CWE-367 is related to CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime) because the vulnerability arises from the improper management of the file resource between the time of check and the time of use. While CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management) is present due to privilege escalation, it is not the core weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n\n    cwe367 -->|Child of| cwe664\n    cwe269 -->|Related to| cwe367\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe367 primary\n    class cwe664,cwe269 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **TOCTOU race condition** (CWE-367) in the `internal_create_saplogon_file` function of the `sapuxuserchk` utility. This allows an attacker to create a symbolic link to a privileged file between the `stat` and `open` calls. Because the `sapuxuserchk` utility is a SUID-root program, it leads to arbitrary file manipulation with root privileges and ultimately results in privilege escalation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-367, the TOCTOU race condition. This is the root cause that allows an attacker to manipulate files with root privileges. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section explicitly mentions this race condition as the core vulnerability: \"A race condition exists in the `internal_create_saplogon_file` function between a `stat` call (checking for the existence of the file) and an `open` call (creating the file).\" This directly supports the selection of CWE-367.\n\nCWE-664 is included because the core issue relates to the improper control of a resource's lifetime.\n\nCWE-269 was considered due to the privilege escalation, however this is a consequence of the root cause, and CWE-269 is discouraged per its mapping guidance as it's a high level classification.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-367 is a Base-level CWE that accurately describes the TOCTOU race condition, and CWE-664 appropriately captures the improper resource control aspect.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs authentication based on the name of a resource being accessed, or the name of the actor performing the access, but it does not properly check all possible names for that resource or actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
