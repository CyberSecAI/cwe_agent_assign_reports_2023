CWE-639 is a child of CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). CWE-862, Missing Authorization, is a class-level CWE and a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). Because CWE-639 is a more specific description of the vulnerability than CWE-862, it is the better choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe639 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n    class cwe863,cwe284,cwe285 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Missing Authorization:** The application **fails to check** if the user has the proper permissions to modify the playlist (root cause).\n2.  **User-Controlled Key:** The attacker can **manipulate the `id` parameter** in the HTTP request (key value) to target another user's playlist.\n3.  **Authorization Bypass:** Due to the missing authorization check and the user-controlled key, the attacker **bypasses authorization** and gains unauthorized access.\n4.  **Playlist Takeover:** The attacker can **modify the playlist** name and status, effectively taking over the playlist.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the **authentication bypass** was the main focus, but further analysis of the provided information revealed that the root cause is an authorization issue.\nThe vulnerability occurs because the application **does not verify if the user making the request is the owner of the playlist being modified.** The attacker can exploit this by manipulating the `id` parameter in the request to target a playlist belonging to another user.\nThe key evidence supporting this analysis is:\n*\"The vulnerability stems from a **lack of authorization checks** in the `objects/playlistAddNew.json.php` endpoint within the AVideo application. Specifically, when modifying a playlist object, the application **does not verify if the user making the request is the owner of the playlist being modified.**\"*\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision to choose CWE-639 over CWE-862 because it is a more specific description of the vulnerability and it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n*   **CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key** The system's authorization functionality **does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.** This aligns directly with the vulnerability description.\n\n*   **CWE-862: Missing Authorization** The product **does not perform an authorization check** when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. This also aligns with the vulnerability description, but is less specific than CWE-639.\n\nCWEs Considered but Not Used:\n\n*   CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') - This CWE is not applicable because there is no evidence of SQL injection in the vulnerability description.\n*   CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag - This CWE is not applicable because there is no evidence of sensitive cookies being used without the HttpOnly flag.\n*   CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function - This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is an authorization issue, not an authentication issue.\n*   CWE-287: Improper Authentication - This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is an authorization issue, not an authentication issue.\n*   CWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name - This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is an authorization issue, not an authentication issue.\n*   CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration - This CWE is not applicable because there is no evidence of session expiration issues in the vulnerability description.\n*   CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization - This CWE is a class-level CWE and is less specific than CWE-639, which is a more accurate description of the vulnerability.\n*   CWE-620: Unverified Password Change - This CWE is not applicable because there is no evidence of password change issues in the vulnerability description.",
