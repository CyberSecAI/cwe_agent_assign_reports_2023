The **root cause** is an **integer overflow** during heap allocation size calculation. |\n| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The **integer overflow** leads to a **heap buffer overflow**. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-190 Integer Overflow, which can precede CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer. CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow is a variant of CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write, which is a child of CWE-119. The integer overflow leads to a smaller-than-required buffer allocation, ultimately causing a heap buffer overflow.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe122 secondary\n    class cwe119,cwe787 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) during heap allocation size calculation. This results in a smaller-than-required memory buffer being allocated on the heap. Subsequent memory copy operations write beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a **heap buffer overflow** (CWE-122). This can then lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the primary **root cause** of the vulnerability is an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) that subsequently leads to a **heap buffer overflow** (CWE-122).\n\nThe provided evidence is strong, with the vulnerability description explicitly mentioning the **integer overflow** and **heap buffer overflow**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further clarifies the chain of events.\n\nThe relationship graph shows how the **integer overflow** can lead to the buffer overflow through improper memory restriction. The **integer overflow** results in a smaller buffer being allocated, and the subsequent write operations cause the overflow.\n\nThe selection of CWE-190 and CWE-122 is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. CWE-190 accurately captures the **root cause** of the vulnerability, while CWE-122 describes the resulting **heap buffer overflow**.
