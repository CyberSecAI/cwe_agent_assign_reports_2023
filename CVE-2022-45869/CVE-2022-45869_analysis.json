It has child CWEs that could potentially provide more specific details, but the current evidence is not granular enough. CWE-362 can lead to CWE-416 (Use After Free) or CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) in certain scenarios. CWE-667 (Improper Locking) is also considered as a Class-level CWE and is a child of CWE-662, it could be related because the vulnerability description mentions a **race condition** due to **improper locking**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe662[\"CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\"]\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n\n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    cwe667 -->|CHILDOF| cwe662\n    cwe662 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe362\n    cwe362 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe416\n    cwe362 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe476\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe667 secondary\n    class cwe662,cwe416,cwe476,cwe367 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition** due to **improper locking** within the KVM subsystem when handling direct page faults. This leads to incorrect zapping of shadow pages, which results in a kernel BUG and general protection fault, ultimately causing a denial of service or memory corruption.\n- **Root Cause:** **Race condition** due to **improper locking**\n- **Weakness:** Incorrect zapping of shadow pages\n- **Impact:** Kernel BUG, general protection fault\n- **Outcome:** Denial of Service (host OS crash) or host OS memory corruption\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified a **race condition** in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel. The primary factor that influenced the classification was the presence of a **race condition** due to **improper synchronization** when nested virtualization and the TDP MMU are enabled, as described in the vulnerability description. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions a **race condition** due to **improper locking** when calling `make_mmu_pages_available()` without holding the `mmu_lock` for write.\n\nThe selection of CWE-362 as the primary CWE is based on the evidence of a **race condition** arising from concurrent execution and **improper synchronization**. The retriever results also list CWE-362 as the top combined result. The mapping guidance for CWE-362 suggests that it is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate, however, the available information does not clearly point to a more specific Base-level CWE. Therefore, CWE-362 is selected as the most appropriate representation of the vulnerability at hand.\n\nCWE-667 (Improper Locking) was considered because the summary also mentioned improper locking, but the primary issue is the race condition itself, making CWE-362 the more direct fit.\n\nThe confidence score is 0.85 because, while the evidence clearly points to a **race condition**, the exact nature of the **improper synchronization** could potentially be more specific if more details were available.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**CWE-362** is selected as the Primary because:\n- The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **race condition**.\n- The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states a **race condition** exists in the KVM module.\n- The function `make_mmu_pages_available()` is called without holding the `mmu_lock` for write when TDP is in use, which can lead to a **race condition** because shadow pages might be zapped incorrectly.\n- The retriever identified this CWE as the top candidate.\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**CWE-367** was considered because it is a specific type of **race condition**. However, the provided information does not indicate that the vulnerability involves a time-of-check time-of-use scenario. The root cause seems to be more related to general **improper synchronization** during concurrent access, rather than a specific timing issue between a check and a use of a resource. Therefore, CWE-367 is not selected.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**CWE-755** was considered but not selected because the vulnerability is primarily related to a **race condition** and **improper synchronization** rather than the handling of exceptional conditions.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**CWE-667** was considered because the CVE reference summary mentions **improper locking**. It's a class-level CWE, and a child of CWE-662. However, the core issue is the resulting race condition (CWE-362) from the improper locking rather than the locking issue itself.\n\n## CWE-833: Deadlock\n**CWE-833** was considered but not selected because the vulnerability does not explicitly describe a deadlock situation where multiple threads are blocked indefinitely waiting for each other. The primary issue is a **race condition** leading to memory corruption and denial of service.\n\n## CWE-1342: Information Exposure through Microarchitectural State after Transient Execution\n**CWE-1342** was considered but not selected because the vulnerability is not directly related to information exposure through microarchitectural state after transient execution. The issue is a **race condition** in the KVM subsystem.\n\n## CWE-609: Double-Checked Locking\n**CWE-609** was considered but not selected because the vulnerability does not explicitly describe double-checked locking. The issue is a **race condition** in the KVM subsystem.\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**CWE-366** was considered but not selected as the primary CWE because, while the vulnerability does involve a **race condition**, the description does not specifically limit the issue to within a single thread. The problem arises from concurrent access in the KVM subsystem, which may involve multiple threads or processes. Therefore, the more general CWE-362 is more applicable.\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**CWE-662** was considered but not selected as the primary CWE because it is a more general, Class-level CWE. While **improper synchronization** is a contributing factor, the more specific issue is the resulting **race condition**, which is better captured by CWE-362.\n\n## CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition\n**CWE-364** was considered but not selected because the vulnerability does not involve a signal handler. The issue is a **race condition** in the KVM subsystem related to memory management.",
