CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE representing a general case of uncontrolled resource consumption, while CWE-770 is a Base-level CWE describing the specific scenario of allocating resources without limits or throttling. The vulnerability description suggests a denial-of-service due to an unauthenticated attacker, which aligns with resource consumption issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of resource control** in the Ivanti product. This leads to the ability of an unauthenticated attacker to consume excessive resources, ultimately causing a denial-of-service.\n  - **Root Cause:** Lack of Resource Control/Throttling\n  - **Weakness:** Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n  - **Impact:** Denial of Service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation) was considered due to its high ranking in similar CVE descriptions. However, the description focuses on the impact (denial-of-service) and the attack vector (unauthenticated attacker) rather than an error in calculation.\n\nThe selection of CWE-400 is based on the vulnerability description indicating a denial-of-service caused by uncontrolled resource consumption. The description states \"An unauthenticated attacker can cause a denial-of-service,\" which directly aligns with the impact of CWE-400. However, CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE and the guidance suggests looking at its children.\n\nCWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is a child of CWE-400 and provides a more specific description of the weakness. It describes a scenario where a product allocates resources without imposing restrictions, which can lead to resource exhaustion and denial-of-service. While the description doesn't explicitly mention allocation without limits, the DoS impact from an unauthenticated attacker strongly suggests this mechanism.\n\nThe Retriever Results also list CWE-770 as a candidate, further supporting this selection. Other candidates such as CWE-23, CWE-20, CWE-287, CWE-269, and CWE-613 were considered but deemed less relevant as they focus on different aspects such as path traversal, input validation, authentication, privilege management, and session expiration, respectively. While related, they don't directly address the root cause of uncontrolled resource consumption leading to DoS.\n\nThe final decision leans towards CWE-400 as the primary weakness with CWE-770 as a secondary candidate, acknowledging the lack of explicit evidence but inferring the likely mechanism based on the attack vector and impact. CWE-400 is selected as the primary because there is not enough root cause evidence to determine the specific type of resource consumption.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
