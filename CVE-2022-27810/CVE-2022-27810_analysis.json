A related CWE is CWE-835 (Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')), which is a Base-level CWE. CWE-674 is a parent of CWE-834 (Excessive Iteration) and CWE-835 is a child of CWE-834. While the vulnerability involves an **infinite recursion**, the evidence suggests that the root cause is the lack of control over the recursion, thus making CWE-674 the primary weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe674[\"CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\"]\n    cwe834[\"CWE-834: Excessive Iteration\"]\n    cwe835[\"CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')\"]\n\n    cwe834 -->|CHILDOF| cwe674\n    cwe835 -->|CHILDOF| cwe834\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe674 primary\n    class cwe835 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  Maliciously formed JavaScript is processed by Hermes.\n2.  This triggers an **infinite recursion** condition in the error handler.\n3.  The **uncontrolled recursion** leads to resource exhaustion and denial of service.\n\nThe root cause is the **uncontrolled recursion** in the error handler (CWE-674), and the impact is a denial-of-service condition due to excessive resource consumption. CWE-835 represents the specific type of loop that results from the uncontrolled recursion.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, key phrases, and CVE reference links content summary. The description clearly states an **infinite recursion** condition in the error handler. The key phrases highlight the **weakness** as **infinite recursion**. The retriever results also list CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion) and CWE-835 (Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')) as potential candidates.\n\nThe decision to choose CWE-674 as the primary CWE is influenced by the fact that the vulnerability description specifically mentions an **infinite recursion** condition. CWE-674 accurately captures the **uncontrolled** nature of the recursion. While CWE-835 (Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')) is also relevant, it is a more specific type of loop and is better represented as a secondary weakness.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-674 is a Class, but its child CWEs are not as fitting as CWE-835 to describe the type of recursion. CWE-835 is a Base CWE, which accurately describes the condition of the infinite loop.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-606: Unchecked Input for Loop Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly check inputs that are used for loop conditions, potentially leading to a denial of service or other consequences because of excessive looping.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive -
