CWE-407 is a class-level CWE. CWE-1333 directly addresses the **inefficient regular expression** issue described in the vulnerability. The resulting impact of the vulnerability can be mapped to CWE-400 since an attacker can cause a denial of service by consuming excessive CPU cycles. The relationship between CWE-1333 and CWE-400 is that the former can lead to the latter.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n\n    cwe1333 -->|ChildOf| cwe407\n    cwe1333 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe407 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the use of an **inefficient regular expression** (CWE-1333) in the `babel.js` file. A crafted input string can trigger excessive backtracking, leading to high CPU consumption and ultimately a denial-of-service condition (CWE-400).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the vulnerability as a **Regular Expression Denial of Service** (ReDoS) flaw. The primary root cause is the **inefficient regular expression** (CWE-1333). The evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section states, \"The core issue is an inefficient regular expression that can lead to excessive backtracking when processing specifically crafted input strings. This is a classic ReDoS scenario.\" The retriever results listed CWE-1333 as the top candidate with a score of 1.0. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-1333 can lead to CWE-400, which is the resulting denial-of-service condition. CWE-1333 is at the base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level.\n\nCWE-400 was considered because the vulnerability results in a denial of service. While CWE-400 is broader, it accurately reflects the impact of the **inefficient regular expression**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that successful exploitation leads to a denial of service. Thus, CWE-400 is added as a secondary weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n##
