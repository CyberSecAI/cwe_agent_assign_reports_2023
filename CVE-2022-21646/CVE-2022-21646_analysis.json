The secondary consideration, CWE-863, relates to the broader issue of **incorrect authorization**, stemming from the flawed wildcard handling. CWE-155 is a variant, making it a more specific and preferred match than the class-level CWE-863.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe155[\"CWE-155: Improper Neutralization of Wildcards or Matching Symbols\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe138[\"CWE-138: Improperly Implemented Complex Logic\"]\n\n    cwe155 -->|CHILDOF| cwe138\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe155 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper wildcard handling** (CWE-155), which leads to **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863) and ultimately allows access to resources that should not be accessible.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment highlighted the **improper wildcard handling** as the core issue. The retriever results strongly supported CWE-155 as the primary candidate. The analysis confirmed that the vulnerability description aligns well with CWE-155's definition, specifically the failure to properly account for wildcard relationships in intersection and exclusion operations. This leads to resources being incorrectly deemed accessible, which is a direct consequence of the **improper wildcard handling**. While **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863) is a valid concern, it is a higher-level effect of the root cause. Therefore, CWE-155 is the more specific and appropriate choice, as it directly addresses the **improper handling of wildcards**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 5902.84\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 5865.80\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer",
