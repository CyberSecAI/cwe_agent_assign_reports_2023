CWE-302 is a ChildOf CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) and CWE-807 (Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision), indicating it is a more specific form of these broader authentication and trust issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe302[\"CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe807[\"CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\"]\n    \n    cwe302 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe302 -->|CHILDOF| cwe807\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe302 primary\n    class cwe1390,cwe807 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect** assumption that certain data is immutable. This **leads to** an **authentication bypass** when an attacker with physical access can manipulate that data, **resulting in** the ability to alter information within the app.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points to CWE-302 as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data**\" as the root cause, which aligns perfectly with CWE-302. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating that the root cause is an \"Intent Manipulation\" exploit leveraging the assumption that certain data within the application is immutable, **leading to** an **authentication bypass**.\n\nThe evidence provided is strong, and the retriever results also list CWE-302 as the top match. The mapping guidance for CWE-302 allows its usage and recommends careful reading of the name and description to ensure an appropriate fit, which is satisfied in this case.\n\nTherefore, CWE-302 is the optimal selection because it directly reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability: the application's **failure to properly validate** or protect against manipulation of intents, **leading to** an **authentication bypass**.\n\nCWE-472 (External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter) was considered because it also deals with assumed-immutable data. However, it is more specific to web applications and parameters, while this vulnerability involves Android intents, making CWE-302 a better fit. CWE-290 (Authentication Bypass by Spoofing) and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) were also considered but deemed too general compared to the specificity of CWE-302.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
