CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is a child of CWE-787 and provides more specific information about the location of the overflow. CWE-119 is a parent Class of CWE-787, but it is too general and discouraged by MITRE. The relationships show that CWE-787 is the most appropriate base-level CWE, and CWE-122 provides a variant when the heap is involved.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe122,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Heap buffer overflow** (CWE-787)\n2.  **Impact:** Heap corruption\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a \"**heap buffer overflow**\" in WebRTC. This directly maps to CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as the root cause. The impact is heap corruption.\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence and the relationships between CWEs. The evidence includes the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions \"**heap buffer overflow**\". The graph relationships helped in determining the level of specificity.\n\nCWE-787 is selected because it represents the **out-of-bounds write** that is occurring. It is a base-level CWE and accurately describes the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) was also considered because the vulnerability occurs in the heap. While this is a more specific variant, the primary weakness is still the out-of-bounds write, making CWE-787 the primary CWE.\n\nCWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) was considered but not selected as the primary CWE because it is a more general class-level CWE and MITRE discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available. The vulnerability description provides enough information to map to CWE-787 directly.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-415: Double Free\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* Irrelevant. The vulnerability is a buffer overflow, not a double free.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* Irrelevant.
