CWE-119 is a class-level CWE, which is too general. Since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a stack-based buffer overflow, CWE-121 is a more specific and appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n    class cwe787 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **ROOT CAUSE:** **Stack-based buffer overflow** due to insufficient bounds checking when copying data into a stack-allocated buffer.\n2.  IMPACT: Overwriting memory on the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points to CWE-121, Stack-based Buffer Overflow, because the vulnerability description explicitly states \"**stack-based buffer overflow**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also alludes to unspecified vulnerabilities that can be exploited remotely. The Retriever Results also list CWE-119 as a possible match, but the description for CWE-119 states that it is commonly misused when lower-level CWEs could be used instead. The vulnerability description is very specific, and CWE-121 is a direct match.\nTherefore, the final selection is CWE-121, as it provides the most accurate and specific classification of the vulnerability. This is supported by direct evidence from the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**CWE-131** was not selected because the provided information does not mention any calculation errors for the buffer size.\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**CWE-124** was not selected because the provided information explicitly states a *buffer overflow*, not a buffer underflow.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**CWE-191** was not selected because there is no mention of any integer underflow.\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**CWE-805** was not selected because the description is not specific enough and doesn't mention the stack.\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**CWE-126** was not selected because the provided information explicitly states a *buffer overflow*, not a buffer over-read.\n\n## CWE-680: Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation to determine how much memory to allocate, but an integer overflow can occur that causes less memory to be allocated than expected, leading to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a named chain, which combines multiple weaknesses.\n\n**CWE-680** was not selected because there is no indication of integer overflow.\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**CWE-193** was not selected because there is no indication of an off-by-one error.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**CWE-125** was not selected because the provided information explicitly states a *buffer overflow*, not a buffer over-read.\n\n## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**CWE-1325** was not selected because it doesn't match the **stack-based buffer overflow** described in the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**CWE-789** was not selected because it doesn't match the **stack-based buffer overflow** described in the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score",
