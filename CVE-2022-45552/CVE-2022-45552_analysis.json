It is a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). CWE-1299 is a base-level weakness describing missing protection mechanisms for alternate hardware interfaces, which is also applicable as the SPI bus interface is an alternate path. CWE-1299 is a child of CWE-420 (Unprotected Alternate Channel). CWE-732 is a class-level weakness describing incorrect permission assignments for critical resources, and could be a broader categorization of the issue. Choosing CWE-1191 and CWE-1299 provides a more precise characterization of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1191[\"CWE-1191: On-Chip Debug and Test Interface With Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe1299[\"CWE-1299: Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface\"]\n    cwe420[\"CWE-420: Unprotected Alternate Channel\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n\n    cwe1191 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe1299 -->|CHILDOF| cwe420\n    cwe1299 -->|CHILDOF| cwe288\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1191 primary\n    class cwe1299,cwe420,cwe732 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insecure permissions** on the SPI bus interface, allowing attackers to bypass access controls and obtain sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **insecure permissions** as the root cause, which could be mapped to a variety of CWEs related to access control and permission issues. The retriever results and complete CWE specifications were then analyzed to determine the most accurate mapping. The primary CWE selected was CWE-1191 (On-Chip Debug and Test Interface With Improper Access Control), as it directly addresses the **lack of access control** on the debug interface. Additionally, CWE-1299 (Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface) was selected as a secondary CWE, as the SPI bus interface represents an alternate path to access control-protected assets. CWE-420 (Unprotected Alternate Channel) was included to reflect the broader issue of neglecting to protect alternative access channels. These selections are based on the evidence from the vulnerability description, which states that access to the device's flash memory via the SPI bus is not protected, and supported by the retriever results and CWE specifications.\n\nThe choice of CWE-1191, CWE-1299 and CWE-420 provides a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability than broader CWEs such as CWE-285 or CWE-732. CWE-1191 is specifically related to debug interfaces, while CWE-1299 and CWE-420 address the issue of alternate access paths.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.

However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
