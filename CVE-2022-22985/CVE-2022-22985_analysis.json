It is related to CWE-74 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')] (Parent). CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] can precede CWE-494 [Download of Code Without Integrity Check]. It is a peer of CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]. CWE-94 [Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')] is a child of CWE-74 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')] and CWE-913 [Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources].\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe494[\"CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check\"]\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\"]\n\n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe79 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe494\n    cwe79 --|PEEROF| cwe352\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe94,cwe494,cwe352,cwe913 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **absence of filters**, which leads to malicious code injection. The injected code is then executed when a legitimate user accesses the web section, resulting in a **cross-site scripting** vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]. This is based on the vulnerability description stating the \"**absence of filters** when loading some sections in the web application of the vulnerable device allows attackers to inject malicious code that will be interpreted when a legitimate user accesses the specific web section where the information is displayed\". The description also contains the key phrase \"**weakness: cross-site scripting**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also indicates that the root cause is a \"lack of input sanitization/filtering\" and the vulnerability is \"**Code Injection**\". The retriever results also list CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] with the highest score. The retriever results included CWE-94 [Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')], but it is less descriptive than CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] in this case because the injected code is not generated by the application, but rather interpreted as part of the web page.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected as there is no indication of HTTP header manipulation in the vulnerability description.*\n\n## CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product acts as an intermediary HTTP agent\n         (such as a proxy or firewall) in the data flow between two\n         entities such as a client and server, but it does not\n         interpret malformed HTTP requests or responses in ways that\n         are consistent with how the messages will be processed by\n         those entities that are at the ultimate destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected as there is no indication of HTTP request/response smuggling in the vulnerability description.*\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*This CWE was not selected as it is a high-level class and more specific CWEs are available.*\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
