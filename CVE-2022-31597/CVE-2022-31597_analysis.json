The application **does not perform necessary authorization checks** for a low privileged authenticated user. |\n| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 0.6 | Pillar | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. A high-level CWE that could apply but is less specific than CWE-862. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the ChildOf relationship between CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). CWE-862 is a child of CWE-284, making it a more specific classification when authorization checks are missing. The high-level nature of CWE-284 makes it a less precise fit than CWE-862.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization check**, leading to **privilege escalation**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-862 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of **missing authorization checks** in the vulnerability description. The description clearly states that the application **does not perform necessary authorization checks**.\n\nThis assessment is strongly based on the provided evidence, specifically the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section, which highlights \"**rootcause:** **does not perform necessary authorization checks**\".\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by emphasizing the hierarchical structure. CWE-862 is a child of CWE-284, which means it's a more specific instance of access control issues.\n\nThe selected CWE, CWE-862, is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability - the absence of authorization checks.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\nNot selected. While this CWE relates to input validation, the primary issue is the **absence of authorization**, not the improper validation of input.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\nNot selected. Similar to CWE-1289, the root cause is the **missing authorization**, not the reliance on untrusted inputs.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\nNot selected. This CWE is about the improper handling of *insufficient* privileges, while the core issue is the *lack* of authorization checks.\n\n## CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch\nNot selected. This is specific to certificate validation, and the vulnerability does not involve certificates.\n\n## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\nNot selected. This is specific to certificate validation, and the vulnerability does not involve certificates.\n\n## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management\nNot selected. This is a very high-level CWE, and the root cause is more specific: a **missing authorization check**.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\nNot selected. The vulnerability isn't related to data authenticity.\n\n## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles\nNot selected. This is a very general CWE and not as descriptive as the specific **missing authorization**.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\nNot selected. This relates to overly permissive lists, but the vulnerability doesn't mention such lists.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\nNot selected. The issue is a **lack of authorization checks**, not how the system handles insufficient privileges.\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\nNot selected. The vulnerability description indicates authorization checks are missing, not that they are performed incorrectly.\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\nNot selected. The vulnerability description indicates authorization checks are missing, not improperly performed.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\nNot selected. The vulnerability is about a **missing authorization check**, not the manipulation of user-controlled keys.\n\n## CWE-287: Improper Authentication\nNot selected. The vulnerability description focuses on authorization, not authentication.\n\n## CWE-322: Key Exchange without Entity Authentication\nNot selected. This is relevant to key exchange scenarios, which are not mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\nNot selected. The vulnerability doesn't involve path resolution.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\nNot selected. The vulnerability does not involve integer overflows.\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\nNot selected. The vulnerability doesn't involve file names or paths.\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\nNot selected. The vulnerability doesn't involve path traversal.\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\nNot selected. The vulnerability doesn't involve resource allocation.\n\n## CWE-178: Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity\nNot selected. The vulnerability doesn't involve case sensitivity.\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\nNot selected. The vulnerability isn't about incorrect privilege assignments.\n\n## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\nNot selected. The vulnerability doesn't involve type confusion.\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\nNot selected. The vulnerability doesn't involve validating quantities in input.",
