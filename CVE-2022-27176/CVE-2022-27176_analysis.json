CWE-791 (Incomplete Filtering of Special Elements) is a base CWE and a parent of CWE-792 (Incomplete Filtering of One or More Instances of Special Elements) which is a variant. Since the vulnerability indicates **incomplete filtering of special elements**, and the description doesn't give enough information to indicate that only one or more instances are affected, CWE-791 is favored.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe791[\"CWE-791: Incomplete Filtering of Special Elements\"]\n    cwe792[\"CWE-792: Incomplete Filtering of One or More Instances of Special Elements\"]\n    cwe1236[\"CWE-1236: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File\"]\n\n    cwe792 -->|CHILDOF| cwe791\n    cwe1236 -->|CHILDOF| CWE-74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe791 primary\n    class cwe792,cwe1236 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incomplete filtering of special elements** (CWE-791) in the RevoWorks product, which leads to the execution of a malicious macro.\n  - Root Cause: **Incomplete filtering of special elements** (CWE-791)\n  - Impact: Execution of a malicious macro\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the root cause as the **incomplete filtering of special elements**, which allows an attacker to execute a malicious macro. The primary CWE mapping is based on the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** which states **\"rootcause: Incomplete filtering of special elements\"** and the **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** which states: **\"Root Cause: The root cause of this vulnerability is the incomplete filtering functionality in the \"File Sanitization Library\" and \"File Sanitization Option\" used by RevoWorks products. Specifically, the third-party component used for sanitization fails to detect and remove Microsoft Excel 4.0 (XLM) macros.\"**\n\nThe graph relationships helped determine the specificity of the CWE. CWE-791 is a base CWE, while CWE-792 is a variant. Since the description does not give specific enough information to use the Variant CWE, the Base CWE is favored.\n\nCWE-1236 is also included as it is possible that the malicious macro is being injected via CSV injection but there is no direct evidence of this.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the weakness based on the provided evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a query intended to access or manipulate data in a data store such as a database, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that can modify the intended logic of the query.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not selected because the vulnerability does not involve data query logic.*\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*Not selected because the vulnerability has a more specific weakness related to filtering.*\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected because the vulnerability does not involve expression language injection.*\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
