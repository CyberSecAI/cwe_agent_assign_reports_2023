It has a parent CWE-1391 (Use of Weak Credentials) that is a Class level CWE. The vulnerability leads to exposure of sensitive information, thus the secondary CWE is CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information) because the attacker was able to log in to the system with **default credentials** and export a report of the eharmony system with sensitive data.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1392[\"CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe1392 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1391\n    cwe1392 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1392 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe1391 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of default credentials (CWE-1392)**, which allows an attacker to log into the system. This leads to the **exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200)** because the attacker can then export reports containing employee data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the resulting impact. The vulnerability description clearly states that the attacker can log in with **default credentials**, making CWE-1392 the most appropriate primary CWE. The subsequent exposure of sensitive information is a direct consequence of this initial weakness, supporting the inclusion of CWE-200 as a secondary CWE. The relationship graph highlights how the use of default credentials can lead to the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nThe decision to use CWE-1392 is strongly supported by the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions **default credentials** as the means of access. This aligns perfectly with the CWE's description of products using default credentials for critical functionality. The evidence is clear: \"The attacker can log in to the system with **default credentials** and export a report of eharmony system with sensetive data.\"\n\nThe other CWEs that were considered but not used are:\n\n*   CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key - While the attacker is bypassing authorization, it's not through a user-controlled key but through default credentials.\n*   CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File - The sensitive information is not being inserted into a log file, but rather exposed through reports.\n*   CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data - The sensitive information is not necessarily being \"sent\" but exposed via report generation.\n*   CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key - The vulnerability description specifies **default credentials**, not necessarily cryptographic keys.\n*   CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') - There is no mention of SQL injection in the vulnerability description.\n*   CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function - There is authentication, but it relies on default credentials.\n*   CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials - While related, the core issue is the use of default credentials, not necessarily their protection.\n*   CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password - The primary problem isn't the storage of the password but the use of default credentials in the first place.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
