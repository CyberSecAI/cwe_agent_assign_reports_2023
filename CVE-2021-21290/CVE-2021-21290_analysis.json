It is a child of CWE-377 which is a Class level CWE. The evidence clearly shows that a temporary file is created with insecure permissions. So the base level CWE-378 is a better fit here.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe378[\"CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions\"]\n    cwe377[\"CWE-377: Insecure Temporary File\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe378 -->|CHILDOF| cwe377\n    cwe377 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe378 primary\n    class cwe377 secondary\n    class cwe668 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is: **Insecure Temp File** (CWE-378) -> Local Information Disclosure\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **insecure temp file** creation as the root cause, leading to local information disclosure. The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** section highlights this as the root cause. The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** confirms this, stating, \"The vulnerability stems from the insecure creation of temporary files using `File.createTempFile()` on Unix-like systems. This method creates files with default permissions that allow other local users to read the contents, leading to potential information disclosure.\"\n\nThe retriever results and complete CWE specifications were then reviewed. CWE-378 (Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions) was identified as the primary CWE because it accurately describes the root cause. CWE-378 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The usage is ALLOWED.\n\nCWE-377 (Insecure Temporary File) was also considered as a secondary candidate. It is a class level CWE and a parent of CWE-378. Given that the description specifically calls out the creation of the temporary file with insecure permissions, CWE-378 is a better fit.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence that the `File.createTempFile()` method on Unix-like systems creates a random file, but, by default will create this file with the permissions -rw-r--r--. Thus, if sensitive information is written to this file, other local users can read this information. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-378.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
