## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with receiving a crafted USB packet with a `header_length` value.

1.  **CWE-191 (Integer Underflow)**: The **lack of input validation** of `header_length` (which is sent in the crafted usb packet) results in an integer underflow when `header_length` is smaller than `UX_HOST_CLASS_PIMA_DATA_HEADER_SIZE`.
2.  **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)**: The incorrect `data_length` value, which is a consequence of the underflow, causes the data pointer to move to an unexpected address, leading to a write buffer overflow.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary **weakness** is the **integer underflow** (CWE-191) due to the **lack of input validation**. This underflow subsequently leads to an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). The evidence is strong, supported by the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The selection of CWE-191 as the primary cause is based on the fact that the integer underflow directly leads to the out-of-bounds write. The relationship analysis confirms this chain of events.

> -   Integer underflow in the `_ux_host_class_pima_read` function when calculating data length.

The provided evidence explicitly mentions the integer underflow as the root cause. The graph relationships show that CWE-191 can precede CWE-787. Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level.

CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) was considered but not selected as the vulnerability description mentions **Integer Underflow**. CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) was also considered, since it is a prerequisite for triggering the integer underflow, but it was not selected because the integer underflow is the more direct and immediate cause of the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Description
Azure RTOS USBX is a high-performance USB host, device, and on-the-go (OTG) embedded stack, that is fully integrated with Azure RTOS ThreadX. The case is, in [_ux_host_class_pima_read](https//github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/master/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c), there is data length from device response, returned in the very first packet, and read by [L165 code](https//github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L165), as header_length. Then in [L178 code](https//github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L178), there is a if branch, which check the expression of (header_length - UX_HOST_CLASS_PIMA_DATA_HEADER_SIZE) > data_length where if header_length is smaller than UX_HOST_CLASS_PIMA_DATA_HEADER_SIZE, calculation could overflow and then [L182 code](https//github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L182) the calculation of data_length is also overflow, this way the later [while loop start from L192](https//github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L192) can move data_pointer to unexpected address and cause write buffer overflow. The fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https//github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel). The following can be used as a workaround Add check of `header_length` 1. It must be greater than `UX_HOST_CLASS_PIMA_DATA_HEADER_SIZE`. 1. It should be greater or equal to the current returned data length (`transfer_request -> ux_transfer_request_actual_length`).

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **integer overflow**
- **impact:** write buffer overflow
- **vector:** crafted USB packet
- **product:** Azure RTOS USBX
- **version:** before 6.1.12
- **component:** ux_host_class_pima_read function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- Integer underflow in the `_ux_host_class_pima_read` function when calculating data length.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- The vulnerability arises from insufficient input validation in the PIMA read function.
- Specifically, the `header_length` value received from a device response is not checked to ensure it is greater or equal to the size of the PIMA data header (`UX_HOST_CLASS_PIMA_DATA_HEADER_SIZE`).
- When `header_length` is smaller than `UX_HOST_CLASS_PIMA_DATA_HEADER_SIZE` a subtraction operation `(header_length - UX_HOST_CLASS_PIMA_DATA_HEADER_SIZE)` results in an integer underflow and corrupts the `data_length` variable.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- The integer underflow leads to an incorrect `data_length` calculation.
- This incorrect value is then used to control a while loop, causing the `data_pointer` to move to an unexpected memory address.
- Subsequently, data is written to this incorrect address, leading to a buffer overflow.
- This can cause corruption and unexpected behavior of the system including possibly arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attacker controls a USB PIMA device which communicates with a vulnerable USB host running the affected code.
- By crafting a malicious PIMA response where the `header_length` is smaller than the `UX_HOST_CLASS_PIMA_DATA_HEADER_SIZE`, an attacker can trigger the underflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to control a malicious USB device that implements the PIMA protocol.
- The attacker must be able to send a crafted PIMA response to the USB host which causes the `header_length` to be smaller than `UX_HOST_CLASS_PIMA_DATA_HEADER_SIZE`.
- This malicious device must be plugged into the USB host system running the vulnerable USBX code.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is located in `ux_host_class_pima_read.c`, specifically around lines 165, 178, 182 and the while loop starting at line 192.
- The fix for this issue is included in USBX release 6.1.12.
- A workaround involves adding a check to ensure the received `header_length` is greater than `UX_HOST_CLASS_PIMA_DATA_HEADER_SIZE` and also that it is greater or equal to the current returned data length.

This detailed explanation provides a thorough understanding of the vulnerability and its implications.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Overflow: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
Wraparound: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
wrap, wrap-around, wrap around: Alternate spellings of "wraparound"

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with "overflow," "underflow," and "wraparound" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called "underflows").


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.

**[Terminology]** 

"Integer overflow" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.


A "wraparound" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.


"Overflow" is sometimes conflated with "wraparound" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.


The "overflow" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use "overflow" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using "underflow" for exceeding the minimum.


Some people use "overflow" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses "underflow" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.


See [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.


**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.




## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

### Extended Description
This can happen in signed and unsigned cases.

### Alternative Terms
Integer underflow: 

"Integer underflow" is sometimes used to identify signedness errors in which an originally positive number becomes negative as a result of subtraction. However, there are cases of bad subtraction in which unsigned integers are involved, so it's not always a signedness issue.


"Integer underflow" is occasionally used to describe array index errors in which the index is negative.

## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.

## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().

### Extended Description

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Heap-based buffer overflows are usually just as dangerous as stack-based buffer overflows.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268:** Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).




## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

### Extended Description


If the pointer contains an uninitialized value, then the value might not point to a valid memory location. This could cause the product to read from or write to unexpected memory locations, leading to a denial of service. If the uninitialized pointer is used as a function call, then arbitrary functions could be invoked. If an attacker can influence the portion of uninitialized memory that is contained in the pointer, this weakness could be leveraged to execute code or perform other attacks.


Depending on memory layout, associated memory management behaviors, and product operation, the attacker might be able to influence the contents of the uninitialized pointer, thus gaining more fine-grained control of the memory location to be accessed.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.

**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of "memory corruption" or "memory safety." As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-32878:** LLM product has a free of an uninitialized pointer
- **CVE-2010-0211:** chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) leads to free of invalid, uninitialized pointer (CWE-824).
- **CVE-2009-2768:** Pointer in structure is not initialized, leading to NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) and system crash.




## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.

### Extended Description
When the length value exceeds the size of the destination, a buffer overflow could occur.
