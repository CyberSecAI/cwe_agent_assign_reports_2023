CWE-201, *Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data*, is considered as a secondary weakness because the data is ultimately sent to another actor, but the **rootcause** is the **improper removal**. CWE-212 can precede CWE-201 in a vulnerability chain. Both CWEs are at the Base level, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe669[\"CWE-669: Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres\"]\n    \n    cwe212 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe201\n    cwe212 -->|CHILDOF| cwe669\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe212 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n    class cwe669 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper removal of sensitive information** (CWE-212). Because the information is not removed, it's then sent as part of the data (CWE-201) to an unintended recipient.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the explicit evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links. The description clearly states \"**Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer**\" which directly corresponds to CWE-212.\n\nThe CVE reference links elaborate that the vulnerability is caused by the `node-eventsource` module not properly enforcing the same-origin policy during HTTP redirects, and failing to strip sensitive headers like \"Authorization\" and \"Cookie\" from the subsequent request. This confirms that sensitive information is being sent due to the **lack of proper removal**, further supporting CWE-212.\n\nCWE-201 is a secondary consideration because it represents the outcome of the initial failure to remove the sensitive data.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they directly address the **rootcause** and the immediate consequence of the vulnerability. Other CWEs, such as CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key), were considered but deemed less relevant as the primary issue is not related to authorization mechanisms but rather the **failure to remove sensitive data**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 5541.32\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
