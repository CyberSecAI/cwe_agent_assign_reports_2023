It has child relationships with CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). CWE-280 (Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges) is at the Base level and could be a more specific alternative if the description explicitly mentioned that the software handled the insufficient permissions incorrectly. Since the vulnerability description only mentioned **missing permission check**, CWE-862 is more appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe280[\"CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe280,cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission check** (CWE-862), leading to local information disclosure.\n  - Missing Authorization (CWE-862) -> Local Information Disclosure\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identifies the root cause as a **missing permission check**, leading to local information disclosure. The vulnerability description key phrases clearly indicate the root cause. The primary CWE match from similar CVE descriptions is CWE-862, which aligns with the vulnerability description.\n\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description and key phrases: \"In wlan driver, there is a possible **missing permission check**. This could lead to local information disclosure.\"\n\nThe graph relationships helped understand that CWE-862 is a class-level CWE, and while more specific base-level CWEs exist, the current description does not provide enough information to map to a more specific CWE. The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity given the available information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information\n- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.\n\nBased on the vulnerability description, \"In wlan driver, there is a possible **missing permission check**. This could lead to local information disclosure,\" the most appropriate CWE is CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). The vulnerability stems from the absence of a permission check, which directly aligns with the description of CWE-862. The impact is local information disclosure, which is a common consequence of missing authorization.\n\nCWE-280 (Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges) was considered but not selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description specifically states that the permission check is **missing**, not that it's improperly handled.",
