## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-22, which is a base class for path traversal vulnerabilities. The vulnerability description clearly states that the Flask application is vulnerable to **absolute path traversal** because the `send_file` function is used unsafely. CWE-36 (Absolute Path Traversal) is a child of CWE-22 and represents the specific type of path traversal. CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) can precede CWE-22 in a vulnerability chain, where external input influences the file path, leading to path traversal. Choosing CWE-22 as the primary mapping provides a general and accurate representation of the vulnerability, while CWE-36 and CWE-73 give additional context.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with external control over the file path (CWE-73). This is followed by the improper limitation of the pathname to a restricted directory, leading to path traversal (CWE-22). In this case, the path traversal is specifically an **absolute path traversal** (CWE-36). The final impact is the ability to access arbitrary files on the server.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified **absolute path traversal** as the root cause due to the unsafe usage of the Flask `send_file` function. The retriever results suggested CWE-22, CWE-36, and CWE-73 as potential mappings. After reviewing the detailed CWE specifications and considering the relationships between the CWEs, CWE-22 was selected as the primary CWE because it accurately describes the vulnerability where the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory. CWE-36 was included as a secondary mapping because the **absolute path traversal** is the specific type of path traversal. CWE-73 was also included as it describes the external control over the file name or path.

The evidence for this assessment is derived from the vulnerability description: "The Niyaz-Mohamed/mosaic repository through 1.0.0 on GitHub allows **absolute path traversal** because the Flask send_file function is used unsafely." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also supports this by stating that "the applications do not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied file paths before passing them to the `send_file` function. This allows an attacker to bypass intended access restrictions and navigate to other directories."

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the vulnerability based on the available evidence and the hierarchical relationships between the CWEs.

## Vulnerability Description
The Niyaz-Mohamed/mosaic repository through 1.0.0 on GitHub allows **absolute path traversal** because the Flask send_file function is used unsafely.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **absolute path traversal**
- **product:** Niyaz-Mohamed/mosaic
- **version:** through 1.0.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to absolute path traversal in Flask applications:

**Vulnerability:** Absolute Path Traversal via Flask's `send_file` Function

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the unsafe use of the `flask.send_file` function in various Flask applications. Specifically, the function was directly supplied with user-controlled input without proper validation or sanitization of the provided path. The function is designed to transmit files from the server to the client and when an absolute path is provided, the application fails to check if the file being accessed is within the intended directory structure, therefore, enabling an attacker to access arbitrary files on the server file system.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**: The core weakness is that the applications do not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied file paths before passing them to the `send_file` function. This allows an attacker to bypass intended access restrictions and navigate to other directories.
*   **Unsafe Use of `os.path.join`**: Some applications use `os.path.join` with user-controlled input when constructing paths for file access. This is also unsafe, as it ignores the safe base path when it encounters an absolute path as an input to `os.path.join` leading to path traversal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker can access arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive data like application source code, configuration files, and system files containing passwords, secrets or cryptographic keys.
*   **Limited Availability Impact**: An attacker could potentially send a large amount of requests to access large files to cause a partial denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network**: The vulnerability is exposed through the network, making it remotely exploitable.
*   **HTTP Requests**: The vulnerability is triggered by crafted HTTP requests containing malicious file paths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Flask application.
*   No prior authentication, user interaction or any specific privileges are required.

**Technical Details:**
* The core problem lies in the direct and unsafe use of the `flask.send_file` function, where the filename argument is derived from user-provided input without validation.

**Affected Repositories (Examples):**
Based on the provided content, the following repositories are affected. They all share a common pattern, using `flask.send_file` with an attacker-controlled filename or path:

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

### Extended Description


Many file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as ".." and "/" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the "../" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as "/usr/local/bin" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.


### Alternative Terms
Directory traversal
Path traversal: "Path traversal" is preferred over "directory traversal," but both terms are attack-focused.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add ".txt" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.

**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.

**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing "/" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).

**[Terminology]** 

Like other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use "directory traversal" only to refer to the injection of ".." and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.


Other variants like "absolute pathname" and "drive letter" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve ".." or equivalent.


**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.

**[Research Gap]** 

Incomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that "..\" is vulnerable, but not test "../" which may also be vulnerable.


Any combination of directory separators ("/", "\", etc.) and numbers of "." (e.g. "....") can produce unique variants; for example, the "//../" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama

- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)




## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as "/abs/path" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

### Extended Description
This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.

- **CVE-2002-1345:** Multiple FTP clients write arbitrary files via absolute paths in server responses
- **CVE-2001-1269:** ZIP file extractor allows full path




## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

### Extended Description


This could allow an attacker to access or modify system files or other files that are critical to the application.


Path manipulation errors occur when the following two conditions are met:

```
		1. An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.
		2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.
```
For example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** CWE-114 is a Class, but it is listed a child of CWE-73 in view 1000. This suggests some abstraction problems that should be resolved in future versions.

**[Relationship]** 

The external control of filenames can be the primary link in chains with other file-related weaknesses, as seen in the CanPrecede relationships. This is because software systems use files for many different purposes: to execute programs, load code libraries, to store application data, to store configuration settings, record temporary data, act as signals or semaphores to other processes, etc.


However, those weaknesses do not always require external control. For example, link-following weaknesses (CWE-59) often involve pathnames that are not controllable by the attacker at all.


The external control can be resultant from other issues. For example, in PHP applications, the register_globals setting can allow an attacker to modify variables that the programmer thought were immutable, enabling file inclusion (CWE-98) and path traversal (CWE-22). Operating with excessive privileges (CWE-250) might allow an attacker to specify an input filename that is not directly readable by the attacker, but is accessible to the privileged program. A buffer overflow (CWE-119) might give an attacker control over nearby memory locations that are related to pathnames, but were not directly modifiable by the attacker.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)
- **CVE-2008-5748:** Chain: external control of values for user's desired language and theme enables path traversal.
- **CVE-2008-5764:** Chain: external control of user's target language enables remote file inclusion.




## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

### Extended Description
This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.

### Alternative Terms
Zip Slip: "Zip slip" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282]. It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).

### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** 

Link following vulnerabilities are Multi-factor Vulnerabilities (MFV). They are the combination of multiple elements: file or directory permissions, filename predictability, race conditions, and in some cases, a design limitation in which there is no mechanism for performing atomic file creation operations.


Some potential factors are race conditions, permissions, and predictability.

The product accepts input that contains a drive letter or Windows volume letter ('C:dirname') that potentially redirects access to an unintended location or arbitrary file.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-36

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-0038:** Remote attackers can read arbitrary files by specifying the drive letter in the requested URL.
- **CVE-2001-0255:** FTP server allows remote attackers to list arbitrary directories by using the "ls" command and including the drive letter name (e.g. C:) in the requested pathname.
- **CVE-2001-0687:** FTP server allows a remote attacker to retrieve privileged system information by specifying arbitrary paths.




## CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g. "eval").

### Extended Description
This may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, or at least modify what code can be executed.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-94

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Factors: special character errors can play a role in increasing the variety of code that can be injected, although some vulnerabilities do not require special characters at all, e.g. when a single function without arguments can be referenced and a terminator character is not necessary.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-4181:** Framework for LLM applications allows eval injection via a crafted response from a hosting provider.
- **CVE-2022-2054:** Python compiler uses eval() to execute malicious strings as Python code.
- **CVE-2021-22204:** Chain: regex in EXIF processor code does not correctly determine where a string ends (CWE-625), enabling eval injection (CWE-95), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
