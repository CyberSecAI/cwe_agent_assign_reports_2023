It is related to CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference) and CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiration). CWE-416 can be preceded by CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input) and CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition).\n\nCWE-787 **Out-of-bounds Write** is a base CWE and is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource after Expiration\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe416 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe120\n    cwe416 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe123\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **GPU memory operations are mishandled**, leading to a **use-after-free**, ultimately resulting in privilege escalation or information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a **use-after-free** vulnerability in the Arm Mali GPU kernel driver. The description explicitly mentions the **\"use-after-free\"** condition, which aligns directly with CWE-416. The root cause, as identified in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, stems from mishandling GPU virtual addresses (`GPU_VA`) and their related memory mappings. An attacker can manipulate memory flags to make underlying pages evictable, leading to unauthorized read-only access to GPU memory from the CPU.\n\nThe primary selection of CWE-416 is supported by the vulnerability description key phrases which lists **weakness: use-after-free**. Additionally, the content summary states that the vulnerability stems from a flaw in handling `GPU_VA` and its related memory mappings.\n\nCWE-787 **Out-of-bounds Write** was considered because memory corruption can be a consequence of memory mishandling. However, the primary issue is the **use-after-free**, making CWE-416 a more precise match for the provided information.\n\nThe evidence supports the selection of CWE-416 at the Variant level of abstraction, as it accurately reflects the specific type of memory management issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* While locking issues could lead to race conditions and memory corruption, there's no specific mention of locking problems in the provided vulnerability description, so this is not a primary factor.\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is too general and doesn't provide specific details about the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* This is more specific than CWE-703, but still doesn't capture the core issue of memory management and **use-after-free**.\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
