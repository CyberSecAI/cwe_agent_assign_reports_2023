# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2022-29500

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-285 | Improper Authorization | 0.8 | Class | Primary | Discouraged |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.6 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship considered was the parent-child relationship between CWE-285 and CWE-284. CWE-285 is a child of CWE-284, representing a more specific case of improper access control. The choice of CWE-285 over CWE-284 reflects an effort to select a more specific classification, aligning with established best practices. CWE-200 is a child of CWE-668.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect access control** (CWE-285), leading to the impact of information disclosure (CWE-200).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description clearly states "**incorrect access control**" as the root cause, leading to information disclosure. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further reinforces this by highlighting the lack of proper access control mechanisms in the Slurm communication channel.

The Retriever Results suggested several CWEs, including CWE-284, CWE-732, CWE-522, CWE-287, CWE-306, and CWE-863. However, after careful consideration, CWE-285 was chosen as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the **incorrect authorization** aspect of the vulnerability. While CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) is a broader category, CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) provides a more specific classification.

CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was considered as a secondary CWE because it represents the impact of the vulnerability. However, according to the mapping guidance, CWE-200 should be used with caution as it often describes the impact rather than the root cause.

The decision to select CWE-285 and CWE-200 was based on the provided evidence and the CWE mapping guidance. The evidence clearly indicates **incorrect access control** as the root cause, and CWE-285 accurately captures this weakness. The selection is based on the provided evidence only.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.

## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.

## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. However, classification research is limited for weaknesses of this type, so there can be gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE that force use of this weakness, even at such a high level of abstraction.

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.

## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 5899.88
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 5812.02
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage
