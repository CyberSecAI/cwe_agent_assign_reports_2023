While CWE-514 is a broader category, the vulnerability description specifically mentions a **covert timing channel**, making CWE-385 the more appropriate and specific choice. The Retriever Results also strongly suggested CWE-385.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe385[\"CWE-385: Covert Timing Channel\"]\n    cwe514[\"CWE-514: Information Leak\"]\n    cwe208[\"CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\"]\n\n    cwe385 -->|CHILDOF| cwe514\n    cwe208 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe385\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n\n    class cwe385 primary\n    class cwe514 secondary\n    class cwe208 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **covert timing channel vulnerability** (CWE-385), which allows an attacker to eavesdrop on encrypted communications, leading to the exposure of sensitive data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, key phrases, and CVE reference links content summary. The key evidence is the explicit mention of a \"**covert timing channel vulnerability**\" as the root cause.\n\nThe graph relationships and the retriever results both point to CWE-385 as the most suitable classification. The \"Usage: Allowed\" mapping guidance for CWE-385 further supports this decision.\n\nThe selection of CWE-385 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the root cause of the vulnerability, which is a **covert timing channel**. While other CWEs like CWE-208 (Observable Timing Discrepancy) are related, they are less specific and do not fully capture the nature of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1421: Exposure of Sensitive Information in Shared Microarchitectural Structures during

Interface\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe lack of protections on alternate paths to access\n                control-protected assets (such as unprotected shadow registers\n                and other external facing unguarded interfaces) allows an\n                attacker to bypass existing protections to the asset that
