It is a child of the class-level CWE-362. CWE-362 describes concurrent execution using shared resources with improper synchronization. The relationship clarifies that CWE-367 is a specific instance of CWE-362, involving a time-of-check time-of-use problem.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    \n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe367 primary\n    class cwe362 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **TOCTOU race condition** (CWE-367). This leads to the ability to obtain and manipulate the address of a message port register, resulting in a potential denial of service. The root cause is the race condition, and the impact is denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is a **TOCTOU race condition** (CWE-367) that allows an attacker to manipulate the address of a message port register, potentially leading to a denial of service.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"A **TOCTOU race condition** in SMU may allow for the caller to obtain and manipulate the address of a message port register which may result in a potential denial of service.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also explicitly mentions \"A TOCTOU race condition exists in the System Management Unit (SMU).\"\n\nCWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition) is the best fit because it specifically describes the scenario where the product checks the state of a resource before using it, but the resource's state can change between the check and use, invalidating the results of the check. The description aligns perfectly with the **TOCTOU race condition** identified in the vulnerability description.\n\nCWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')) is also applicable because it describes the broader class of race conditions. However, since the vulnerability specifically mentions a **TOCTOU race condition**, CWE-367 is more specific and thus more appropriate as the primary CWE.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but deemed less appropriate:\n\n*   CWE-667 (Improper Locking), CWE-662 (Improper Synchronization), and CWE-833 (Deadlock) were considered because they relate to concurrency issues. However, the vulnerability is more specifically a **TOCTOU race condition**, not a general locking or synchronization issue.\n*   CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) was considered but is not directly related to the **TOCTOU race condition** described.\n*   CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) was considered, but the vulnerability does not directly involve buffer overflows or out-of-bounds access.\n\nThe selection of CWE-367 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly corresponds to the identified **TOCTOU race condition**. The evidence strongly supports this classification, and the relationship analysis clarifies its place within the broader category of race conditions (CWE-362).",
