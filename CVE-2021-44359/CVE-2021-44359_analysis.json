CWE-1287, \"Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input,\" is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-20. Choosing CWE-1287 provides a more specific description of the vulnerability, as the input validation failure is specifically related to the type of the input.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe1287[\"CWE-1287: Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input\"]\n    \n    cwe1287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe1287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20), specifically the **failure to validate the type of the 'param' field** (CWE-1287). This leads to an assertion failure and ultimately a reboot, resulting in a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the provided evidence, points to CWE-20 as the primary weakness, given the **lack of validation of the input**. However, the description also provides details about the specific type of input that's not being validated. Specifically, the application \"**incorrectly assumes that the `param` field in the JSON request body is always a JSON object**\". Therefore, while CWE-20 captures the general issue, **CWE-1287: Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input**, provides a more precise characterization of the vulnerability. The evidence is strong, given the detailed explanation in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section, which states: \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20). The application fails to validate the type of the `param` field in the JSON request body, leading to an unexpected program state.**\"\n\nThe final decision is to select CWE-20 as the primary weakness, with CWE-1287 as a secondary, more specific weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
