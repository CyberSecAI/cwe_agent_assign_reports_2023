Since the vulnerability description clearly indicates a **missing authorization** check, CWE-862 was chosen over its parent, CWE-285, because it provides a more specific classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|ChildOf| cwe284\n    cwe200 -->|PeerOf| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284, cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check on the `streamed-list-objects` endpoint (CWE-862), which leads directly to information exposure (CWE-200), where unauthorized actors can access objects within the OpenFGA store.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which includes the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The description clearly states that the root cause is a **missing authorization header validation**.\n\nThe primary CWE mapping is CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). This selection is strongly supported by the vulnerability description key phrases which identifies the **rootcause** as \"**missing authorization header validation**\". The CVE reference links content summary also explicitly calls out the \"**Authorization Bypass:** The primary weakness is the failure to check the authorization header on the `streamed-list-objects` endpoint. This allows unauthenticated access to the endpoint.\"\n\nCWE-284 (Improper Access Control) and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) were considered, but they are too high-level and less descriptive than CWE-862. The MITRE mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-284 due to its high-level nature and suggests using more specific descendants. While CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was also considered, it was not selected because the vulnerability involves a complete **lack of authorization** rather than an incorrect implementation.\n\nThe selected CWE (CWE-862) is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause described in the vulnerability: the **missing authorization** check.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
