There are no child CWEs listed in the results or specifications that offer a more specific description of the **missing permission check**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of:\n  1.  Root Cause: **Missing permission check** (CWE-862)\n  2.  Impact: Local denial of service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates a **missing permission check**, which directly corresponds to CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]. The primary CWE match from the provided data is CWE-862, which aligns with the vulnerability description.\n\nThe description states: \"In music service, there is a **missing permission check**. This could lead to local denial of service in contacts service with no additional execution privileges needed.\"\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-862 as the top combined result. The Complete CWE Specifications for CWE-862 describes it as: \"The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\" This aligns directly with the **missing permission check** described in the vulnerability.\n\nOther CWEs, like CWE-732 [Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource], were considered but deemed less appropriate because the vulnerability is due to a **missing permission check** rather than an incorrect assignment of permissions. CWE-732 is also often misused for vulnerabilities in which permissions are not checked.\n\nCWE-20 [Improper Input Validation] was also considered, but the root cause is not related to validating an input but rather the absence of an authorization check.\n\nCWE-862 is selected as the primary CWE because it accurately captures the root cause of the vulnerability, which is a **missing permission check**. The evidence directly supports this classification, and the available information does not suggest a more specific CWE. The final selection is based on the provided evidence only.",
