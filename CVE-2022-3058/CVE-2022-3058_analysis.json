CWE-416 is a child of CWE-825 (**Expired Pointer Dereference**) and CWE-672 (**Operation on Resource after Expiration**). It can be preceded by CWE-120 (**Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')**) or CWE-123 (**Write-what-where Condition**).\nCWE-366 (**Race Condition within a Thread**) is a Base-level CWE and is a child of CWE-362 (**Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')**) and CWE-662 (**Improper Synchronization**).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource after Expiration\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n    cwe366[\"CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization\"]\n    cwe662[\"CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\"]\n    \n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe120 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe416\n    cwe123 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe416\n    cwe366 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    cwe366 -->|CHILDOF| cwe662\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe366 secondary\n    class cwe825,cwe672,cwe120,cwe123,cwe362,cwe662 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **use after free** (CWE-416), which occurs when a program attempts to access memory after it has been freed. This can lead to heap corruption and potentially remote code execution. A possible concurrent execution using a shared resource with improper synchronization (CWE-366) might lead to the use after free (CWE-416).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is a **use after free** in the Sign-In Flow of Google Chrome. The vulnerability occurs when the program reuses or references memory after it has been freed. The provided description and the summary of CVE reference links content provides clear evidence for the **rootcause** being a **use after free**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-416 is further supported by the \"Retriever Results\" which lists CWE-416 as the second best match. The evidence provided explicitly states \"**rootcause: use after free**\". The \"**impact**\" is heap corruption which can lead to remote code execution. The \"**vector**\" is crafted UI interaction.\n\nCWE-366 was considered because **use-after-free** vulnerabilities can often be triggered by race conditions. Although there is no explicit mention of a race condition in the provided vulnerability description, it is plausible that a race condition could contribute to the vulnerability, but it has a lower confidence value.\n\nThe primary CWE, CWE-416, is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is the preferred level.",
