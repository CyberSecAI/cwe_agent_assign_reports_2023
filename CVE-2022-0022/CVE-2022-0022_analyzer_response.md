*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-916, is a base-level CWE that directly addresses the core issue: the use of a password hash with insufficient computational effort. It is related to CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash) and CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) as a more specific form of these general weaknesses. The relationship between CWE-916 and its parent classes helps refine the classification to the specific problem of weak password hashing.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a weak cryptographic algorithm** (CWE-916). This **weakness** leads to password hashes that are susceptible to cracking. The final impact is the potential for attackers to gain unauthorized access to accounts.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis strongly pointed towards CWE-916, supported by both the vulnerability description and the retriever results. The vulnerability description explicitly states the use of a **weak cryptographic algorithm** for password hashing, which aligns perfectly with CWE-916. The CVE reference links further confirm this by stating the **root cause** is the use of a **weak cryptographic algorithm** which allows attackers to potentially crack the stored password hashes. The retriever results also ranked CWE-916 as the top candidate.

The relationship analysis reinforces this decision, as CWE-916 is a specific type of cryptographic weakness related to password hashing. While CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) is a broader category, CWE-916 provides a more precise classification.

The final selection of CWE-916 is based on the direct evidence of a **weak** password hashing algorithm, the high ranking in retriever results, and the specificity of CWE-916 compared to its parent classes. This is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately reflects the root cause of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
To fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
