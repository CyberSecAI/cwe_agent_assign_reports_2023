It is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), reflecting that it's a specific case of memory boundary issues.\n\nCWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is also related because incorrect length values can lead to reading beyond the allocated buffer. Similarly, CWE-130 (Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency) can be a cause of CWE-805.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe805[\"CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe130[\"CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\"]\n\n    cwe805 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe130 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe805\n    cwe805 -->|CANLEADTO| cwe125\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe805 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe125,cwe130 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the Apache HTTP Server **returning lengths to applications calling rwsread() that point past the end of the storage allocated for the buffer**.\n  - This **incorrect length calculation** (CWE-805) leads to\n  - **Out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125), potentially causing\n  - **Information disclosure** as the server returns data beyond the buffer.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability description clearly states a problem with returning incorrect lengths, pointing towards CWE-805 (Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, explicitly mentioning \"incorrect length calculation.\" This **incorrect length calculation** is the **root cause** that leads to potential out-of-bounds access.\n\nThe retriever results also support this, with CWE-805 having a high dense score.\n\nCWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is a potential consequence of this **incorrect length**, as indicated in the CVE summary, which can lead to **information disclosure**.\n\nCWE-130 (Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency) is considered because the root cause involves how the server handles the length returned by `r:wsread()`. The server isn't properly checking or handling this length, which leads to the vulnerability.\n\nI've chosen CWEs at the Base level where possible to provide the most specific classification. The evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-805 as the primary CWE, with CWE-125 and CWE-130 as secondary candidates.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe
