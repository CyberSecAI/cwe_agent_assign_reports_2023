The relationship between these two is that a race condition can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    \n    cwe416 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe362\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe362 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-362**, leading to **CWE-416**, and resulting in local escalation of privilege.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a **race condition** leading to a **use after free**.\n\nThe vulnerability description key phrases also highlights the root cause and weakness as follows:\n- **rootcause:** **race condition**\n- **weakness:** **use after free**\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary also highlights the same:\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Race condition within the `disp` component leading to a use-after-free scenario.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper synchronization (CWE-662) leading to a use-after-free.\n\nThe retriever results suggest **CWE-362** and **CWE-416** as candidates. **CWE-416** is chosen as the primary weakness because the description explicitly mentions \"use after free\". **CWE-362** is selected as a secondary CWE because the root cause is a race condition.\n\n**CWE-662 (Improper Synchronization)** was considered but not chosen as the primary because while the CVE Reference mentions it, the main description focuses on the **use after free** condition. Furthermore, the retriever results also showed a high score for **CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'))** which is a better fit for the \"race condition\" root cause.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-416** and **CWE-362** is based on the explicit mention of \"use after free\" and \"race condition\" in the vulnerability description, making them the most appropriate and specific classifications for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
