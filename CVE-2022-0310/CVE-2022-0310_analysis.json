The secondary CWE, CWE-119, is a class-level CWE, and mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available. Because the vulnerability is specifically a heap-based buffer overflow, CWE-122 is a more appropriate and specific choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe122 primary\n    class cwe787,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is a **heap buffer overflow** which leads to potential **heap corruption**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the most specific CWE that accurately reflects the vulnerability description, which explicitly states a \"**heap buffer overflow**.\" The \"**heap buffer overflow**\" is the **weakness**. The evidence provided in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this.\n\nThe selection of CWE-122 is based on the explicit mention of \"heap buffer overflow\" in the vulnerability description and the supporting evidence. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-122 is a child of CWE-119 and CWE-787, providing a more specific classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-415: Double Free\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.\n**Justification for Exclusion:** This CWE describes a double free vulnerability, which is distinct from a heap buffer overflow.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n**Justification for Exclusion:** This CWE describes a failure to clear sensitive information, which is distinct from a heap buffer overflow.\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n**Justification for Exclusion:** This CWE describes a race condition, which is distinct from a heap buffer overflow.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n**Justification for Exclusion:** This CWE describes a failure to properly release resources, which is distinct from a heap buffer overflow.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n**Justification for Exclusion:** While incorrect buffer size calculation can lead to a buffer overflow, the root cause described in the vulnerability is the overflow itself, not the calculation.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n**Justification for Exclusion:** This CWE describes improper locking, which is distinct from a heap buffer overflow.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n**Justification for Exclusion:** This CWE describes an integer underflow, which is distinct from a heap buffer overflow.\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n**Justification for Exclusion:** While off-by-one errors can lead to buffer overflows, the root cause described in the vulnerability is the overflow itself.\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n**Justification for Exclusion:** This CWE describes a race condition, which is distinct from a heap buffer overflow.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n**Justification for Exclusion:** This CWE describes an out-of-bounds read, while the vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write (overflow).\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6230.79\n**Source**: sparse\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value.\n**Justification for Exclusion:** Integer overflows can lead to buffer overflows but this is not stated as the root cause.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 5875.78\n**Source**: sparse\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n**Justification for Exclusion:** This CWE describes an out-of-bounds read, while the vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write (overflow).\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 5776.77\n**Source**: sparse\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n**Justification for Exclusion:** While off-by-one errors can lead to buffer overflows, the root cause described in the vulnerability is the overflow itself.\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 5662.00\n**Source**: sparse\n**Description**:\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary.\n**Justification for Exclusion:** This CWE is too general and doesn't specify the heap.\n\n## CWE-415:",
