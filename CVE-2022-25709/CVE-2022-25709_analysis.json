The description matches the weakness. |\n| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. This is a possible impact of the primary weakness. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-823, which is a Base level CWE. CWE-823 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-823 can precede CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read). These relationships suggest a potential vulnerability chain starting with an out-of-range pointer offset, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds read or write.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe823[\"CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    \n    cwe823 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe823 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    cwe823 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe125\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe823 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe787,cwe125 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of out of range pointer offset** (CWE-823), which leads to memory corruption. The memory corruption could manifest as an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states \"**use of out of range pointer offset** while processing qmi msg\" which directly aligns with CWE-823 (Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset). The description for CWE-823 states: \"The product performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations for the resulting pointer.\"\n\nThe memory corruption mentioned in the description is a potential consequence of this out-of-range offset, which can be further classified as CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write). While the description doesn't explicitly mention a write, memory corruption strongly suggests that a write operation outside the intended buffer could be occurring.\n\nCWE-823 is chosen as the primary CWE due to the explicit mention of the out-of-range pointer offset. The relationship graph also confirms this, with CWE-823 potentially leading to CWE-787.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but not selected:\n\n*   CWE-824 (Access of Uninitialized Pointer), CWE-822 (Untrusted Pointer Dereference), and CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference): These were not selected because the description specifically mentions an \"out of range pointer offset,\" not an uninitialized, untrusted, or expired pointer.\n*   CWE-1285 (Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input) and CWE-129 (Improper Validation of Array Index): These were not selected because the description focuses on the use of an out-of-range offset, not the validation of the offset itself. While there might be a lack of validation, the primary issue is the usage.\n*   CWE-188 (Reliance on Data/Memory Layout): This was not selected because while memory layout might be a contributing factor, the core issue is the use of an out-of-range offset.\n*   CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference): This was not selected because it's not related to pointer arithmetic or offsets.\n*   CWE-843 (Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')): This was not selected as there is no evidence of type confusion in the description.\n*   CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write): This was considered as a secondary impact.\n*   CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read): This was not selected as the description did not mention a read, though it could be a theoretical impact.\nRelevant CWE Information:",
