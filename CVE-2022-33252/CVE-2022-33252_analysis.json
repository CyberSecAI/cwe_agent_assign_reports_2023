CWE-126 is a variant of CWE-125, specifying that the read occurs *after* the targeted buffer. There were no relevant chain relationships.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe788[\"CWE-788: Access of Memory\"]\n    \n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe125\n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe788\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe126 primary\n    class cwe125,cwe788 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Buffer Over-read** (CWE-126)\n2.  **Impact:** Information disclosure\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **buffer over-read** as the **rootcause** from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\". The retriever results highlighted CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read) as the top candidate. The vulnerability description explicitly states \"Information disclosure due to **buffer over-read** in WLAN while handling IBSS beacons frame.\".\n\nCWE-126 is a Variant of CWE-125 and describes reading data past the end of a buffer. Since the vulnerability description explicitly indicates that the read is happening past the end of the buffer, CWE-126 is the most appropriate and specific choice. The MITRE mapping guidance allows for the usage of CWE-126.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but deemed less suitable:\n\n*   CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error): While an off-by-one error *could* lead to a buffer over-read, the description doesn't provide sufficient information to confirm this.\n*   CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound): This is not directly related to the description of the vulnerability.\n*   CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input): While input validation might be a factor in preventing this vulnerability, the description focuses on the over-read itself, not the lack of validation.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-126 is based on the explicit mention of \"buffer over-read\" in the vulnerability description and its precise definition.",
