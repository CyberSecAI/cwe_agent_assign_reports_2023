CWE-1284 ([CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1284.html)) is a child of CWE-20 ([CWE-20: Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)), representing a more specific type of input validation issue.

However, CWE-20 ([CWE-20: Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)) is a Class-level CWE, and the mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific Base or Variant level CWEs are available.\nCWE-1284 ([CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1284.html)) is considered because the DxgkDdiEscape handler likely deals with quantities related to display or GPU operations, such as buffer sizes or offsets. This makes CWE-1284 ([CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1284.html)) a plausible secondary candidate.
