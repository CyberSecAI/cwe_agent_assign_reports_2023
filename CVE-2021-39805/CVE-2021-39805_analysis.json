It is related to CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is considered as a secondary CWE because the **missing bounds check** is a form of improper validation. CWE-1284 can precede CWE-789 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    \n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe125\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe1284 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing bounds check** (CWE-1284), which leads to an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125), eventually resulting in remote information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) as the primary weakness based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary. The description clearly states an \"**out of bounds read** due to a **missing bounds check**.\" The CVE reference links content summary confirms the \"Out-of-bounds read vulnerability\" and \"Information disclosure.\"\n\nCWE-125 is a base-level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The retriever results also list CWE-125 as a candidate.\n\nCWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) was considered because the **missing bounds check** is a failure to validate the size or length of the input, which could have prevented the out-of-bounds read.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but ultimately not selected:\n\n*   CWE-191 (Integer Underflow) and CWE-190 (Integer Overflow) were not chosen because the root cause isn't specifically related to integer handling but rather a general **missing bounds check**.\n*   CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is not applicable as the vulnerability is not related to authorization.\n*   CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) is not applicable because the description does not mention null pointers.\n*   CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is a class-level CWE and too generic. The vulnerability is more specifically related to a **missing bounds check**, making CWE-1284 a more appropriate secondary mapping.\n\nThe selection of CWE-125 and CWE-1284 are based on the explicit evidence in the vulnerability description and the retriever results. The relationships between the CWEs helped refine the understanding of the vulnerability chain, leading to a more accurate classification. The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, providing a clear and concise representation of the vulnerability.",
