It is related to CWE-280, Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges, which is a Base-level CWE. The vulnerability description mentions a **missing permission check**, which directly relates to the definition of CWE-862. CWE-280 is considered as a secondary candidate because it describes the broader issue of handling insufficient permissions.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe280[\"CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe280 -->|CHILDOF| cwe755\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe280 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission check** (CWE-862), which leads to local information disclosure.\n- Root cause: **Missing permission check** (CWE-862)\n- Impact: Local information disclosure\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment and final conclusion are largely based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description key phrases. The phrase \"**missing permission check**\" strongly suggests that the software fails to perform an authorization check before allowing access to a resource, which aligns directly with CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).\n\nCWE-862 is chosen as the primary CWE because it accurately represents the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly states a \"**missing permission check**,\" which is the core characteristic of CWE-862. This is at the Class level, and the mapping guidance suggests examining child CWEs. However, none of the children of CWE-284 or CWE-285 fit the vulnerability description better than CWE-862. CWE-280 (Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges) is considered, as a secondary issue, because the **missing permission check** leads to improper handling of insufficient privileges, ultimately resulting in information disclosure.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
