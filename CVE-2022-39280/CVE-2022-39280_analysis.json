Since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a regular expression with denial-of-service implications, CWE-1333 is the more precise choice. CWE-1333 is a child of CWE-407 and CWE-400.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    cwe407 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe407 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **inefficient regular expression** (CWE-1333), which leads to excessive CPU consumption and ultimately results in a denial-of-service (DoS).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly suggests that **CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity)** is the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**regular expression denial of service**,\" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the **root cause** is a regex susceptible to ReDoS due to its inefficient design leading to excessive backtracking. The evidence shows the **weakness** of an inefficient regex pattern and the resulting denial of service. The retriever results also list CWE-1333 as the top match.\n\nCWE-1333 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level for mapping root causes. The MITRE mapping guidance allows for the use of CWE-1333. The description of CWE-1333 perfectly matches the vulnerability where a regular expression with possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity consumes excessive CPU cycles.\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) was considered as a secondary CWE because the excessive CPU usage from the regex leads to resource exhaustion. While it is related, CWE-1333 more precisely captures the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not chosen:\n\n*   CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion): While ReDoS can involve recursion, it's the complexity of the regular expression itself that's the primary issue, not uncontrolled recursion in a general sense.\n*   CWE-407 (Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity): CWE-1333 is a child of CWE-407 and is more specific to the type of algorithm involved.\n*   CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling): This is a consequence of the regex issue, not the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
