# Analysis for CVE-2021-37606

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-328 | Use of Weak Hash | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-208 | Observable Timing Discrepancy | 0.8 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is between CWE-328 and its parents, specifically CWE-326 and CWE-327. While CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) is a parent, CWE-328 is more specific as it directly identifies the **weak hash** as the issue. CWE-208 (Observable Timing Discrepancy) is included because the vulnerability description mentions timing differences are used to infer collisions.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events starts with the **use of a weak hash** (CWE-328). This **weakness** leads to the ability for an attacker to **recover the key**. The attacker can then **infer collisions** by **measuring timing differences** (CWE-208), especially in long-running web services.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description and key phrases, pointed to a problem with key recovery due to a flaw in the hashing algorithm. The evidence from the CVE reference links content summary strongly supports that the **Meow hash 0.5/calico does not sufficiently thwart key recovery**. The retriever results confirmed that CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash) is a strong candidate. The vulnerability description mentions timing differences so CWE-208 is added as a secondary weakness.

The analysis is heavily based on the provided evidence, specifically:

*   "**Meow hash 0.5/calico does not sufficiently thwart key recovery**" - This directly indicates a problem with the hashing algorithm's strength.
*   "an attacker who can query whether theres a collision in the bottom bits of the hashes of two messages, as demonstrated by an attack against a long-running web service that allows the attacker to infer collisions by measuring timing differences" - This supports the inclusion of CWE-208 because timing differences are being exploited.
*   "Insufficient AES Rounds", "Symmetry Properties", "Message Absorption Weaknesses", "Invertibility of Initial State" - These points detail the nature of the **weakness** in the hashing algorithm.
*   "Key Recovery: An attacker can recover the full 1024-bit key with about 2^49 queries to the hash function, even with a restricted model where the attacker can only check if the lowest bit of two hashes collide." - Again, key recovery is a prominent aspect of this vulnerability.

CWE-328 is chosen because the core issue is the use of a **weak hashing algorithm**, which allows for key recovery and collision inference. CWE-208 is added because **timing differences** are used to **infer collisions**, and is a component of the attack vector. Both CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity (Base).

Other considered CWEs and why they were rejected:

*   CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm): While related, CWE-328 is more specific as it identifies the **weakness** at the hash level, not just at the broader cryptographic algorithm level.
*   CWE-759 (Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt): This is too specific. The problem is not just the lack of a salt, but the inherent **weakness** of the hash itself.
*   CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values): While randomness might be a factor in the hash's **weakness**, the primary problem is not insufficient randomness in the values themselves, but the **weakness** of the algorithm.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-37606

## Vulnerability Description
**Meow hash 0.5/calico does not sufficiently thwart key recovery** by an attacker who can query whether theres a collision in the bottom bits of the hashes of two messages, as demonstrated by an attack against a long-running web service that allows the attacker to infer collisions by measuring timing differences.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Meow hash 0.5/calico does not sufficiently thwart key recovery**
- **impact:** infer collisions
- **vector:** query whether theres a collision in the bottom bits of the hashes of two messages
- **attacker:** attacker

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerabilities identified in Meow Hash, specifically concerning CVE-2021-37606:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Insufficient AES Rounds:** Meow Hash uses a low number of AES rounds per byte of input processed, making it susceptible to attacks. The hash function also has a slow feedback loop for the output of AES back into its input, limiting the accumulation of high-degree terms.
*   **Symmetry Properties:** The design of Meow Hash allows a 512-bit invariant subspace in the absorption function, creating weaknesses for carefully crafted keys and messages.
*   **Message Absorption Weaknesses:** The first and last byte of each 32-byte message block are injected in only one place during message absorption, which gives attackers precise control over injecting differentials.
*   **Invertibility of Initial State:** The initial state of Meow hash is based entirely on the key, which can be used for producing pre-images under a chosen key.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Differential Cryptanalysis:** A vanishing differential characteristic with a probability of approximately 2^-45 exists within Meow Hash, which can be used to produce collisions.
*   **Key Recovery:**  An attacker can recover the full 1024-bit key with about 2^49 queries to the hash function, even with a restricted model where the attacker can only check if the lowest bit of two hashes collide.
*   **SAT Solving Attacks:** With a known key, an attacker can use SAT solvers to:
    *   Generate preimages.
    *   Steer the internal state to a desired value
    *   Force the hash into the invariant subspace.
    *   Produce collisions between arbitrary messages of the same length.
*    **Symmetry-based collisions:** Collisions can be generated by exploiting the symmetry property under weak, specially crafted keys.
*   **Reduced-Round Weakness:**  Reduced-round variants of the finalization phase of Meow Hash show biases under second-order differential analysis and square attacks.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Collision Generation:** The vanishing differential characteristic and SAT-based attacks allow the construction of message collisions. In practice, this allows an attacker to craft different files (PNG, etc.) that have the same hash.
*   **Key Exposure:** The key recovery attack compromises the secret key, rendering Meow Hash completely insecure.
*   **MAC Weakness:** While Meow Hash is not explicitly intended to be a cryptographically secure hash, its cryptographic claims at level 2 and level 3 are broken. Meow hash was found to be unsuitable for use in message authentication codes or hash tables where collision-induced DoS attacks are a concern.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Chosen Message Attack:** The attacker can craft specific messages to exploit the vanishing characteristic or symmetry weaknesses, causing collisions.
*   **Query-Based Key Recovery:** An attacker with the ability to query if the lowest bits of hashes collide can use this to recover the key.
*   **Known Key Attack:**  If the attacker has the key (perhaps through the key recovery attack), then SAT solving techniques can be used to generate various attacks.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Chosen Message Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to submit messages for hashing.
*   **Hash Collision Detection:** For the key recovery attack, the attacker only needs the capability to detect collisions (even just the lowest bit) between hashes (i.e. a timing channel). This could be possible when the hash function is used in a hash table.
*   **Computational Resources:** SAT-based attacks require significant computational power.

**Summary:**

The analysis of Meow Hash demonstrates severe vulnerabilities that can be exploited by various attacks. These weaknesses arise from design choices that prioritize speed over security, resulting in easy collision generation, key recovery, and overall lack of security. The analysis confirms that the creators' disclaimers of its cryptographic security were indeed accurate.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).

### Extended Description


A hash function is defined as an algorithm that maps arbitrarily sized data into a fixed-sized digest (output) such that the following properties hold:


  1. The algorithm is not invertible (also called "one-way" or "not reversible")

  1. The algorithm is deterministic; the same input produces the same digest every time

 Building on this definition, a cryptographic hash function must also ensure that a malicious actor cannot leverage the hash function to have a reasonable chance of success at determining any of the following:

  1. the original input (preimage attack), given only the digest

  1. another input that can produce the same digest (2nd preimage attack), given the original input

  1. a set of two or more inputs that evaluate to the same digest (birthday attack), given the actor can arbitrarily choose the inputs to be hashed and can do so a reasonable amount of times

What is regarded as "reasonable" varies by context and threat model, but in general, "reasonable" could cover any attack that is more efficient than brute force (i.e., on average, attempting half of all possible combinations). Note that some attacks might be more efficient than brute force but are still not regarded as achievable in the real world.

Any algorithm that does not meet the above conditions will generally be considered weak for general use in hashing.


In addition to algorithmic weaknesses, a hash function can be made weak by using the hash in a security context that breaks its security guarantees. For example, using a hash function without a salt for storing passwords (that are sufficiently short) could enable an adversary to create a "rainbow table" [REF-637] to recover the password under certain conditions; this attack works against such hash functions as MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2.

- **CVE-2005-4900:** SHA-1 algorithm is not collision-resistant.
- **CVE-2020-25685:** DNS product uses a weak hash (CRC32 or SHA-1) of the query name, allowing attacker to forge responses by computing domain names with the same hash.




## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

### Extended Description
In security-relevant contexts, even small variations in timing can be exploited by attackers to indirectly infer certain details about the product's internal operations. For example, in some cryptographic algorithms, attackers can use timing differences to infer certain properties about a private key, making the key easier to guess. Timing discrepancies effectively form a timing side channel.

- **CVE-2019-10482:** Smartphone OS uses comparison functions that are not in constant time, allowing side channels
- **CVE-2014-0984:** Password-checking function in router terminates validation of a password entry when it encounters the first incorrect character, which allows remote attackers to obtain passwords via a brute-force attack that relies on timing differences in responses to incorrect password guesses, aka a timing side-channel attack.




## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

### Extended Description
Discrepancies can take many forms, and variations may be detectable in timing, control flow, communications such as replies or requests, or general behavior. These discrepancies can reveal information about the product's operation or internal state to an unauthorized actor. In some cases, discrepancies can be used by attackers to form a side channel.

### Alternative Terms
Side Channel Attack: Observable Discrepancies are at the root of side channel attacks.

## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity
**Abstraction:** Class

- **CVE-2020-10735:** Python has "quadratic complexity" issue when converting string to int with many digits in unexpected bases
- **CVE-2020-5243:** server allows ReDOS with crafted User-Agent strings, due to overlapping capture groups that cause excessive backtracking.




## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.

### Extended Description


Cryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.


It is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.


Since the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered "unsafe" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.


For a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30273:** SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity
- **CVE-2022-30320:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.
- **CVE-2008-3775:** Product uses "ROT-25" to obfuscate the password in the registry.




## CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a one-way cryptographic hash against an input that should not be reversible, such as a password, but the product does not also use a salt as part of the input.

### Extended Description


This makes it easier for attackers to pre-compute the hash value using dictionary attack techniques such as rainbow tables.


It should be noted that, despite common perceptions, the use of a good salt with a hash does not sufficiently increase the effort for an attacker who is targeting an individual password, or who has a large amount of computing resources available, such as with cloud-based services or specialized, inexpensive hardware. Offline password cracking can still be effective if the hash function is not expensive to compute; many cryptographic functions are designed to be efficient and can be vulnerable to attacks using massive computing resources, even if the hash is cryptographically strong. The use of a salt only slightly increases the computing requirements for an attacker compared to other strategies such as adaptive hash functions. See CWE-916 for more details.


### Alternative Terms

- **CVE-2006-1058:** Router does not use a salt with a hash, making it easier to crack passwords.




## CWE-385: Covert Timing Channel
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Covert timing channels convey information by modulating some aspect of system behavior over time, so that the program receiving the information can observe system behavior and infer protected information.

### Extended Description


In some instances, knowing when data is transmitted between parties can provide a malicious user with privileged information. Also, externally monitoring the timing of operations can potentially reveal sensitive data. For example, a cryptographic operation can expose its internal state if the time it takes to perform the operation varies, based on the state.


Covert channels are frequently classified as either storage or timing channels. Some examples of covert timing channels are the system's paging rate, the time a certain transaction requires to execute, and the time it takes to gain access to a shared bus.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.9, members of the CWE Hardware SIG are working to improve CWE's coverage of transient execution weaknesses, which include issues related to Spectre, Meltdown, and other attacks that create or exploit covert channels. As a result of that work, this entry might change in CWE 4.10.






## CWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a cryptographic primitive that uses an Initialization
			Vector (IV), but the product does not generate IVs that are
			sufficiently unpredictable or unique according to the expected
			cryptographic requirements for that primitive.
			

### Extended Description
By design, some cryptographic primitives (such as block ciphers) require that IVs must have certain properties for the uniqueness and/or unpredictability of an IV. Primitives may vary in how important these properties are. If these properties are not maintained, e.g. by a bug in the code, then the cryptography may be weakened or broken by attacking the IVs themselves.

**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, "randomness" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-1472:** ZeroLogon vulnerability - use of a static IV of all zeroes in AES-CFB8 mode
- **CVE-2011-3389:** BEAST attack in SSL 3.0 / TLS 1.0. In CBC mode, chained initialization vectors are non-random, allowing decryption of HTTPS traffic using a chosen plaintext attack.
- **CVE-2001-0161:** wireless router does not use 6 of the 24 bits for WEP encryption, making it easier for attackers to decrypt traffic




## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

### Extended Description
When product generates predictable values in a context requiring unpredictability, it may be possible for an attacker to guess the next value that will be generated, and use this guess to impersonate another user or access sensitive information.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-693
CanPrecede -> CWE-804

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be primary to many other weaknesses such as cryptographic errors, authentication errors, symlink following, information leaks, and others.

**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.3, CWE-330 and its descendants are being investigated by the CWE crypto team to identify gaps related to randomness and unpredictability, as well as the relationships between randomness and cryptographic primitives. This "subtree analysis" might result in the addition or deprecation of existing entries; the reorganization of relationships in some views, e.g. the research view (CWE-1000); more consistent use of terminology; and/or significant modifications to related entries.
