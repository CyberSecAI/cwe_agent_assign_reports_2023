This CWE can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79). CWE-20, Improper Input Validation, is a class-level weakness and a parent of CWE-113, but is less specific and therefore considered a secondary mapping.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe113 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe113 primary\n    class cwe20,cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper validation** of HTTP headers, leading to **HTTP header injection** (CWE-113). This can then lead to cache poisoning and cross-site scripting (CWE-79).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **improper validation** as the root cause, leading to **HTTP header injection**. The retriever results highlighted CWE-113, CWE-20, and CWE-79 as potential candidates.\n\nThe evidence provided states: \"IBM WebSphere Application Server 7.0, 8.0, 8.5, and 9.0 and IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty 17.0.0.3 through 22.0.0.9 are vulnerable to **HTTP header injection**, caused by **improper validation**. This could allow an attacker to conduct various attacks against the vulnerable system, including cache poisoning and cross-site scripting. IBM X-Force ID 229429.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-113 as the primary CWE is based on its precise match to the vulnerability description concerning **HTTP header injection** due to **improper validation**. While CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is a broader class encompassing various validation issues, CWE-113 specifically addresses the CRLF injection in HTTP headers, making it the more specific and appropriate choice. CWE-79 is a potential impact, but not the root cause. The mapping guidance for CWE-113 allows its usage and is at the variant level of abstraction.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   **CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')**: This is a class-level CWE that is too broad.\n*   **CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')**: This is specific to LDAP, not HTTP.\n*   **CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference**: This is specific to XML, not HTTP.\n*   **CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag**: This is related to cookie security, not header injection.\n*   **CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')**: This is specific to OS commands, not HTTP.\n*   **CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information**: This is related to cleartext transmission, not header injection.\n*   **CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output**: While related to output handling, CWE-113 is more specific to HTTP header injection.\n*   **CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**: While XSS is a possible consequence, the direct weakness is the header injection.",
