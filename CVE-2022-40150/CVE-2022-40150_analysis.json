The root cause appears to involve excessive memory allocation, potentially due to an excessive size value (CWE-789) or a lack of limits on resource allocation (CWE-770).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    \n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe789,cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the parsing of untrusted XML or JSON data. The **weakness** is the potential for **out of memory** due to excessive resource allocation. This leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) **impact**. The chain can be summarized as follows:\n\n1.  Untrusted XML/JSON data input\n2.  **Improper or missing validation** of input size/complexity\n3.  Excessive memory allocation (**out of memory**)\n4.  Denial of Service (CWE-400)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed towards CWE-787 due to the primary CWE match from similar CVE descriptions, but it's not the most accurate. The vulnerability is primarily an instance of CWE-400 because the **out of memory** condition leads directly to a denial of service. The root cause might be related to excessive memory allocation via an excessive size value (CWE-789) or a lack of limits/throttling on resource allocation (CWE-770).\n\nThe supporting evidence includes:\n*   \"Those using Jettison to parse untrusted XML or JSON data may be vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks (DOS). If the parser is running on user supplied input, an attacker may supply content that causes the parser to crash by **Out of memory**.\"\n*   \"The libjettison-java library, a collection of StAX parsers and writers for JSON, is vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks.\"\n*   \"A specially crafted user input can cause the parser to crash due to an out-of-memory error, leading to a denial of service.\"\n*   \"The vulnerability can be exploited by providing malicious XML or JSON data to the parser.\"\n*   \"The issue is related to memory exhaustion.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the connection between resource allocation issues and the ultimate impact of a denial of service.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the vulnerability based on the available evidence. CWE-400 captures the overall impact, while CWE-789 and CWE-770 potentially describe the underlying causes.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were
