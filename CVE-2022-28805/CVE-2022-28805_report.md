# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2022-28805

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-126 | Buffer Over-read | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the CWE selection is the ChildOf relationship between CWE-126 and CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), indicating that CWE-126 is a specific type of out-of-bounds access. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) was considered but deemed less appropriate since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions an over-read condition.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events in this vulnerability is as follows:
1.  **Missing luaK_exp2anyregup call:** This is the root cause, a **lack of** a specific function call during Lua code compilation.
2.  **Heap-based buffer over-read:** As a result of the missing call, the code reads data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.
3.  **Information Disclosure (potential):** The out-of-bounds read could potentially expose sensitive information in adjacent heap memory.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on identifying the most specific CWE related to the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions a "**heap-based buffer over-read**". The "**lack of a certain luaK_exp2anyregup call**" is the root cause. The selection of CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read) as the primary CWE is based on the direct mention of a "buffer over-read" in the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The Retriever Results also identified CWE-126 as the top combined result.

The evidence supporting this assessment is found in the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases": "**weakness: heap-based buffer over-read**" and the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary": "*   The vulnerability is a heap buffer over-read." and "*   The code reads beyond the allocated buffer on the heap."

CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) was considered, as it is a parent of CWE-126. However, because the description specifically mentions an "over-read" condition, CWE-126 was chosen as the more accurate representation of the vulnerability. The mapping guidance for CWE-126 states: "This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities."

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately reflect the technical details provided in the vulnerability description.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code uses a variable that has not been initialized, leading to unpredictable or unintended results.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not initialize a critical resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-665: Improper Initialization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses or accesses a resource that has not been initialized.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 6169.45
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
