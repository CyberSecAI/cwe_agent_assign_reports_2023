# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2022-35260

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-193 | Off-by-one Error | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is **CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error)**. This is related to the issue of reading past the end of a buffer, which could lead to **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)**. If the read works, writing a zero byte beyond its boundary may happen causing **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)**.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with an **CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error)** when parsing the `.netrc` file. This leads to **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)**, and subsequently a potential **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)**. This can cause a denial-of-service.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment and resulting conclusion are based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference. The key phrase "rootcause: **off-by-one error**" in the Vulnerability Description Key Phrases section is the primary driver for selecting **CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error)**. The description states that "curl would first read past the end of the stack-based buffer", which directly relates to **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)**. The subsequent action "write a zero byte beyond its boundary" supports the inclusion of **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)**.

The graph relationships show that **CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error)** can precede **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)** which can precede **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)**. The selection of **CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error)** as the primary CWE is based on its identification as the root cause. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity (Base) as they accurately represent the weakness and its progression.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not used*: The description does not explicitly mention equivalence validation.

## CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product communicates with a host that provides a certificate, but the product does not properly ensure that the certificate is actually associated with that host.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not used*: This is specific to certificate validation which is not relevant to the vulnerability description.

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not used*: While the vulnerability involves a buffer, the root cause is not an incorrect calculation of its size, but rather an **off-by-one error**.

## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not used*: This is specific to HTTP header injection, which is not relevant to the vulnerability description.

## CWE-170: Improper Null Termination
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not terminate or incorrectly terminates a string or array with a null character or equivalent terminator.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not used*: Although a null byte is written beyond the boundary, the root cause is not related to null termination.

## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not used*: The vulnerability does not involve handling an inconsistent length field.

## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not used*: This is specific to certificate validation, which is not relevant to the vulnerability description.

## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not used*: Too generic; the root cause is more specific.

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not used*: This is not related to resource management.

## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is
