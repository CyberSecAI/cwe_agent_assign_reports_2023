A crafted Host header is sent in a request.\n  2.  The Accellion FTA software **fails to neutralize** special elements in the header.\n  3.  This leads to **SQL injection**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the Accellion FTA software is affected by **SQL injection** via a crafted Host header. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this, stating \"The vulnerability stems from a **SQL injection** flaw,\" and \"The core issue is a **SQL injection** vulnerability... This allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries executed by the application.\"\n\nThe retriever results also list **CWE-89** [CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')] as a relevant CWE.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-89** [CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')] is based on the direct evidence of **SQL injection**, making it the most accurate and specific CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
