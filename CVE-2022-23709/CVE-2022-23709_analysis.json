This vulnerability occurs because the system lacks an authorization check when a user attempts to modify alerting rules within the Uptime feature. CWE-862 is a child of CWE-285 **Improper Authorization** and CWE-284 **Improper Access Control**. CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** is considered as a secondary CWE because it could be that an authorization check was performed, but it was done incorrectly. The evidence leans towards a **missing** check as the root cause. Both CWE-862 and CWE-863 are Class level abstractions.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|ChildOf| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|ChildOf| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check, leading to the ability for users with read access to modify alerting rules. This can further lead to disabling critical alerts, potentially disrupting service operations.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **missing authorization** in Kibana's Uptime feature, which allows users with read access to modify alerting rules. The evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly states, \"The vulnerability stems from a **missing authorization** check in Kibana's Uptime feature.\" This directly supports the selection of CWE-862.\n\nThe alternative, CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization**, was considered because it's possible that an authorization check was present but flawed. However, the explicit mention of a **missing authorization** check makes CWE-862 the more accurate primary classification. Both CWEs are at the Class level of abstraction.\n\nThe final decision is heavily based on the provided evidence, which clearly points to a **missing authorization** mechanism.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n*Not Used:* This is too general. A more specific authorization issue is present.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* There's no evidence that the authorization bypass is happening through a user-controlled key.\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* While there is a privilege issue, it stems from the missing authorization check rather than an incorrect assignment.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* This is not the primary issue.
