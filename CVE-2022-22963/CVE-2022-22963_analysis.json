It has hierarchical relationships as a ChildOf CWE-77 and CWE-74. CWE-94 is also a base CWE and a child of CWE-74. Both CWE-917 and CWE-94 are related to code injection, but CWE-917 is more specific to Expression Language Injection, making it a better fit for the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe917[\"CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\"]\n\n    cwe917 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe917 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe917 primary\n    class cwe94,cwe74,cwe77,cwe913 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation**, leading to the ability to inject a specially crafted SpEL expression. This results in remote code execution and access to local resources.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Improper Input Validation**\n  - **Weakness:** Injection of a specially crafted SpEL expression (CWE-917)\n  - **Impact:** Remote Code Execution and Access to Local Resources\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **improper neutralization** of special elements in an Expression Language statement, as highlighted in the vulnerability description and CVE details. The vulnerability description states that a user can provide a \"specially crafted SpEL as a routing-expression that may result in remote code execution and access to local resources.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating, \"The vulnerability lies in the routing functionality of Spring Cloud Function where a maliciously crafted Spring Expression Language (SpEL) expression can be supplied by a user, leading to remote code execution.\" This aligns directly with the description of CWE-917, which addresses the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an expression language statement.\n\nCWE-94 was considered because the exploitation leads to code execution, but it is a more general case of code injection. Since the injection is specifically related to SpEL, CWE-917 is a more precise and appropriate classification.\n\nThe selection of CWE-917 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the vulnerability's root cause and the technology involved (SpEL).\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
