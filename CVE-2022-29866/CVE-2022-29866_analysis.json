While it's generally preferred to select Base or Variant level CWEs, the evidence strongly points to **uncontrolled resource consumption** as the root cause. CWE-400 has child CWEs like CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) and CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) that are more specific and were considered. The graph relationships highlight that CWE-400 can be caused by insufficient resource pools (CWE-410).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe410[\"CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe410 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe789,cwe410 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a crafted request leading to **uncontrolled resource consumption**, ultimately resulting in memory exhaustion and a denial-of-service (DoS).\n\nCrafted Request -> **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** (CWE-400) -> Memory Exhaustion -> Denial of Service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-400 as the primary candidate, driven by the vulnerability description's explicit mention of **uncontrolled resource consumption**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" further supports this by stating: \"The vulnerability stems from **uncontrolled resource consumption** within the OPC UA .NET Standard Stack.\"\n\nWhile CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE and is generally discouraged, the provided evidence doesn't offer enough specificity to pinpoint a more precise Base or Variant level CWE. The key phrase \"uncontrolled resource consumption\" directly maps to CWE-400. Although the Retriever Results suggested CWE-770 and CWE-789, these are potential mechanisms of achieving **uncontrolled resource consumption** and not the root cause as described in the vulnerability. Therefore, sticking with CWE-400 is the most accurate choice based on the provided information, even though it is a Class-level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n##

adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more

be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe

Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage:
