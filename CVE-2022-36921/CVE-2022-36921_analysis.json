It is a child of CWE-285 (\"Improper Authorization\"), which is discouraged for use when more specific CWEs exist. CWE-639 and CWE-319 were considered as possible supporting CWEs to describe the vulnerability, although their link is less direct and their selection is based on the impact described in the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe639 -->|PEEROF| cwe862\n    cwe319 -->|PEEROF| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe639,cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing permission check** (CWE-862). This allows an attacker with Overall/Read permissions to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs. This leads to the capture of credentials stored in Jenkins (CWE-639), which are then transmitted in cleartext (CWE-319).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points to CWE-862 (\"Missing Authorization\") as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **missing permission check**, which aligns perfectly with CWE-862's description: \"The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\"\n\nSupporting Evidence:\n*   Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: \"**rootcause:** **missing permission check**\"\n*   CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"The Coverity Plugin **does not perform a permission check** in an HTTP endpoint.\"\n\nCWE-862 is a Class-level CWE. While the mapping guidance suggests examining its children for a better fit, none of the children CWEs are more appropriate.\n\nCWE-639 (\"Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\") was considered because the vulnerability allows an attacker to use attacker-specified credentials IDs. However, the **missing permission check** is the root cause, and the ability to use attacker-specified credentials is a consequence.\n\nCWE-319 (\"Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\") was considered because the attacker captures credentials stored in Jenkins. While the description does not explicitly specify that the credentials were sent in clear text, this is a common outcome of capturing stored credentials.\n\nThe final decision is to assign CWE-862 as the primary CWE due to the explicit mention of a **missing permission check** in the vulnerability description. CWE-639 and CWE-319 are included as secondary CWEs, with a lower confidence score due to an indirect connection to the root cause. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-862 being a Class-level CWE that accurately represents the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
