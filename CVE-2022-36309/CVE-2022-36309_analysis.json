The `ActiveBank` parameter in the POST request is vulnerable to command injection. The attacker can inject shell commands by adding them after a semicolon within the `ActiveBank` parameter.\n\nThe evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary includes:\n*   \"The `recoverySubmit.cgi` CGI script, which runs with root privileges, has a command injection vulnerability.\"\n*   \"**Command Injection (CWE-78):** The script does not properly sanitize user-provided input before using it in a system command. Specifically the 'ActiveBank' parameter allows for command injection.\"\n\nThe Retriever Results also listed **CWE-78**: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') as the second best match.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-78** is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the improper neutralization of special elements used in constructing an OS command. This aligns with the CWE's description and mapping guidance, which encourages the use of Base-level CWEs when they accurately represent the weakness.\n\nCWE-77 was considered, but the description explicitly states this is an OS command, making **CWE-78** a better fit.\nCWE-20 was considered, but this is a more general Improper Input Validation which is not the root cause but rather a condition.\nCWE-94 was considered but discarded as the product isn't generating code, rather executing OS commands.\nCWE-22 was considered but discarded as this is a **Path Traversal** issue, and not related to this vulnerability.",
