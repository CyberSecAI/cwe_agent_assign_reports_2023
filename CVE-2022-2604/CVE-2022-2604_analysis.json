It can be preceded by CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input) or CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition). CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a potential impact that can follow a use-after-free. The analysis focuses on identifying the root cause first and then considering potential impacts or related weaknesses.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on a Resource after Expiration\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    \n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe120 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe416\n    cwe123 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe416\n    cwe416 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe825,cwe672,cwe120,cwe123,cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use after free** condition (CWE-416). This leads to **heap corruption**. Although the description indicates **heap corruption**, it is not explicit about the nature of the corruption, which could manifest as an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary focus is on the **use after free** vulnerability as the root cause. The description clearly states this condition in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section. The \"**heap corruption**\" is a consequence of the **use after free**, and potentially an **out-of-bounds write**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-416 is based on the explicit mention of \"use after free\" in the vulnerability description. The supporting evidence is:\n\n*   \"**rootcause:** **use after free**\" from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\"\n*   \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** \\- Use-after-free: This occurs when a program attempts to access memory after it has been freed, potentially leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.\" from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\"\n\nCWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is considered as a secondary candidate because the vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to write data outside the intended memory region, leading to **heap corruption**.\n\nThe abstraction levels are chosen to be as specific as possible. CWE-416 is a Variant, which is a preferred level of abstraction. CWE-787 is a Base, which is also a preferred level of abstraction.\n\nCWE-366, CWE-226, CWE-404, CWE-667, CWE-665, CWE-662, CWE-909, CWE-664, CWE-1419, CWE-457, CWE-451, CWE-362, CWE-415, CWE-364, CWE-367, CWE-123, CWE-120, CWE-825, CWE-476, CWE-170, and CWE-1341 were considered but not chosen because they did not directly match the root cause of the vulnerability as described. Some of these, such as CWE-362 (Race Condition), might be indirectly related, but the provided information does not offer sufficient evidence to support their inclusion.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
