CWE-614 is a variant of CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information), and is a secondary concern. The relationships show that improper cookie management can lead to sensitive information being transmitted insecurely. The abstraction levels (Variant for both) are appropriate because they directly address the specific issues of missing HttpOnly and Secure flags on cookies.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1004[\"CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag\"]\n    cwe614[\"CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Insecure Cookie Management\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe1004 -->|CHILDOF| cwe732\n    cwe614 -->|CHILDOF| cwe319\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1004 primary\n    class cwe614 secondary\n    class cwe732,cwe319 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper** configuration of HTTP cookies, specifically the session cookie, due to the **missing** `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags. This leads to the potential for the session cookie to be accessed via JavaScript (CWE-1004) and transmitted over non-HTTPS connections (CWE-614), ultimately resulting in information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which includes the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the session cookie **misses** the HttpOnly flag and the secure flag. The CVE reference links content summary confirms this by stating that the **root cause** is the **improper** configuration of HTTP cookies, specifically the session cookie, and that the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags are **not being set**.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the connection between cookie management and information disclosure. CWE-1004 and CWE-614 are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the **missing** HttpOnly and Secure flags, respectively, which are the **root causes** of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
