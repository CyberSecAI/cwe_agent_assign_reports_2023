Although CWE-319 is a child of CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data), CWE-319 is more specific and therefore more appropriate. CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) and CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) are variants of CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) and peers of each other, but do not directly apply as the vulnerability involves transmitting credentials in cleartext rather than using hardcoded ones.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n\n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe259 --|PEEROF| cwe321\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe311 secondary\n    class cwe798,cwe259,cwe321 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **vulnerable firmware** which leads to **cleartext transmission of sensitive information** and finally results in **attacker** being able to **sniff traffic and decrypt login credential details** and obtain **admin rights**.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Vulnerable Firmware** leading to the insecure practice.\n  - **Weakness:** **Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319)**.\n  - **Impact:** Sniffing traffic, decrypting credentials, and gaining admin rights.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly indicates that the vulnerability involves transmitting login credentials in cleartext over HTTP. This aligns perfectly with CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information).\n\nThe **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** explicitly states: \"The root cause is the cleartext transmission of sensitive information by the affected Moxa MGate protocol gateways. Specifically, login credentials transmitted over HTTP are not encrypted, making them vulnerable to interception.\"\n\nThe **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** include \"**vulnerable firmware**,\" \"**sniff traffic and decrypt login credential details**,\" and \"**attacker**,\" further supporting the assessment that the firmware vulnerability leads to the exposure of sensitive data in transit.\n\nThe relationship analysis indicates that while CWE-311 is a parent, CWE-319 is a more specific and appropriate choice.\n\nThe selection of CWE-319 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the core issue of transmitting sensitive information without encryption.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can

dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users. In fact, it should be noted that recoverable encrypted passwords provide no significant benefit over plaintext passwords since they are subject not only to reuse by malicious attackers but also by malicious insiders. If a system administrator can recover a password directly, or use a brute force search on the available information, the administrator can use the password on other accounts.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant",
