## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper verification of cryptographic signature** (CWE-347), which is a result of **improper input validation** and **incorrect signature verification logic**. This leads to the acceptance of malformed signatures, which can ultimately result in a bypass of authentication/authorization and data integrity loss.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment strongly pointed towards CWE-347, "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature," due to the vulnerability description explicitly stating that the "**rootcause**" is "**improper verification of cryptographic signature**". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms this, stating, "The vulnerability stems from **improper verification of cryptographic signatures** in the `jsrsasign` library when handling JWS (JSON Web Signatures) and JWT (JSON Web Tokens)." The retriever results also list CWE-347 as the top candidate with a high score.

CWE-345, "Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity," was considered as a broader classification, but CWE-347 was chosen for its greater specificity and alignment with the described vulnerability.

The final decision to use CWE-347 as the primary CWE is based on the direct evidence from the vulnerability description and supporting information, confirming that the root cause is indeed an improper verification of cryptographic signatures. The CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the identified weakness.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-25898

## Vulnerability Description
The package jsrsasign before 10.5.25 are vulnerable to Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature when JWS or JWT signature with non Base64URL encoding special characters or number escaped characters may be validated as valid by mistake. Workaround Validate JWS or JWT signature if it has Base64URL and dot safe string before executing JWS.verify() or JWS.verifyJWT() method.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper verification of cryptographic signature**
- **vector:** JWS or JWT signature with non Base64URL encoding special characters or number escaped characters
- **product:** jsrsasign
- **version:** before 10.5.25

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2022-25898:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from improper verification of cryptographic signatures in the `jsrsasign` library when handling JWS (JSON Web Signatures) and JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Specifically, the `JWS.verify` and `JWS.verifyJWT` methods were not correctly validating the signature portion of the JWS/JWT.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Input Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper input validation on the signature string. The vulnerable code was accepting signatures containing characters that are not part of the Base64URL character set (e.g., `!@$%^&*()`) and number escaped characters (e.g., `\1\2\3`). These characters should not be present in a valid Base64URL encoded signature.
- **Incorrect Signature Verification Logic:**  The `JWS.verify` and `JWS.verifyJWT` methods did not enforce the correct format for the signature, leading to the acceptance of malformed signatures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Bypass of Authentication/Authorization:** If the `jsrsasign` library's JWS/JWT validation is used in authentication or authorization processes (such as OpenID Connect or OAuth2), an attacker could forge a JWT or JWS by inserting special characters into the signature, bypassing the security mechanism, and potentially gaining unauthorized access.
- **Data Integrity Loss:**  An attacker could modify the payload of a JWT or JWS and create a forged signature that the vulnerable library would accept as valid.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over a network (AV:N). An attacker can craft a malicious JWS/JWT with an invalid signature and send it to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any special user privileges to exploit the vulnerability (PR:N).
- **No User Interaction Required:**  The attack can be performed without any user interaction (UI:N).
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable service.
- **Knowledge of JWT Structure:** The attacker should be familiar with the structure of JWS and JWT.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- The fix involved adding a new function, `isBase64URLDot`, to `src/base64x.js`. This function is used to validate whether a given string is a valid base64url encoded string or dot.
- The fix was released in version 10.5.25 of `jsrsasign`.
- The vulnerability affects versions of the library from 4.8.0 up to 10.5.24.
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature).

**Workaround:**

- Before upgrading to the patched version, users are advised to validate JWS or JWT signatures to ensure the signature is Base64URL encoded and dot safe before using the `JWS.verify()` or `JWS.verifyJWT()` methods. This means checking that the signature string only contains characters from the Base64URL set ('A-Z', 'a-z', '0-9', '-', '_') and dots('.').

- **CVE-2019-10071:** Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies




## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.

### Extended Description


Cryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.


It is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.


Since the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered "unsafe" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.


For a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30273:** SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity
- **CVE-2022-30320:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.
- **CVE-2008-3775:** Product uses "ROT-25" to obfuscate the password in the registry.




## CWE-834: Excessive Iteration
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an iteration or loop without sufficiently limiting the number of times that the loop is executed.

### Extended Description
If the iteration can be influenced by an attacker, this weakness could allow attackers to consume excessive resources such as CPU or memory. In many cases, a loop does not need to be infinite in order to cause enough resource consumption to adversely affect the product or its host system; it depends on the amount of resources consumed per iteration.

### Alternative Terms

## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

### Extended Description
In security-relevant contexts, even small variations in timing can be exploited by attackers to indirectly infer certain details about the product's internal operations. For example, in some cryptographic algorithms, attackers can use timing differences to infer certain properties about a private key, making the key easier to guess. Timing discrepancies effectively form a timing side channel.

## CWE-287: Improper Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
authentification: An alternate term is "authentification", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.
AuthN: "AuthN" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authentication" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from "AuthZ," which is an abbreviation of "authorization." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.
AuthC: "AuthC" is used as an abbreviation of "authentication," but it appears to used less frequently than "AuthN."

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-1585:** Missing challenge-response step allows authentication bypass using public key.




## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.

### Extended Description
Some regular expression engines have a feature called "backtracking". If the token cannot match, the engine "backtracks" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.
 Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:


  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.

  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.

  - The input can be long enough.

 Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. 

### Alternative Terms
ReDoS: ReDoS is an abbreviation of "Regular expression Denial of Service".
Regular Expression Denial of Service: While this term is attack-focused, this is commonly used to describe the weakness.
Catastrophic backtracking: This term is used to describe the behavior of the regular expression as a negative technical impact.
