# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2022-25685

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 0.8 | Pillar | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship impacting the decision is that CWE-284 is a high-level Pillar, and the mapping guidance discourages its use, suggesting more specific descendants related to authorization. However, with the limited information provided, it is difficult to pinpoint a more specific CWE.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain starts with **improper authorization**, leading to a denial-of-service impact. The specific steps in between are not detailed in the vulnerability description.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified CWE-284 as the primary candidate based on the **improper authorization** root cause. The Retriever Results also listed CWE-284 as the top combined result.

The key phrase in the description is "**improper authorization**", which directly relates to access control issues. However, the limited information prevents a more granular classification. The description only states that the **improper authorization** during error handling leads to a denial of service.

CWE-284 is a Pillar, and the mapping guidance discourages its use, suggesting more specific descendants such as CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) or CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). However, the provided evidence does not offer sufficient detail to differentiate between missing or incorrect authorization. Therefore, while discouraged, CWE-284 is the most appropriate high-level classification given the available information.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-284: Improper Access Control
**Abstraction:** Pillar
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

### Extended Description
Access control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:
  - Authentication (proving the identity of an actor)
  - Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and
  - Accountability (tracking of activities that were performed)
When any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.

There are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:
  - Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.
  - Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.

### Alternative Terms
Authorization: The terms "access control" and "authorization" are often used interchangeably, although many people have distinct definitions. The CWE usage of "access control" is intended as a general term for the various mechanisms that restrict which users can access which resources, and "authorization" is more narrowly defined. It is unlikely that there will be community consensus on the use of these terms.

### Relationships
None

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-284 is extremely high-level, a Pillar. Its name, "Improper Access Control," is often misused in low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287] or by active use of the OWASP Top Ten, such as "A01:2021-Broken Access Control". It is not useful for trend analysis.
**Comments:** Consider using descendants of CWE-284 that are more specific to the kind of access control involved, such as those involving authorization (Missing Authorization (CWE-862), Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863), Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource (CWE-732), etc.); authentication (Missing Authentication (CWE-306) or Weak Authentication (CWE-1390)); Incorrect User Management (CWE-286); Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints (CWE-923); etc.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
- Abstraction
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
- CWE-306: Missing Authentication
- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
- CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]**
This entry needs more work. Possible sub-categories include:
  - Trusted group includes undesired entities (partially covered by CWE-286)
  - Group can perform undesired actions
  - ACL parse error does not fail closed

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24985:** A form hosting website only checks the session authentication status for a single form, making it possible to bypass authentication when there are multiple forms
- **CVE-2022-29238:** Access-control setting in web-based document collaboration tool is not properly implemented by the code, which prevents listing hidden directories but does not prevent direct requests to files in those directories.
- **CVE-2022-23607:** Python-based HTTP library did not scope cookies to a particular domain such that "supercookies" could be sent to any domain on redirect

Other considered CWEs:

*   **CWE-862 (Missing Authorization)** and **CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization):** These are more specific alternatives to CWE-284. However, the provided information does not specify whether authorization is missing or incorrect, making it impossible to select one of these more specific CWEs.
*   **CWE-939 (Improper Authorization in Handler for Custom URL Scheme):** This is too specific as the vulnerability description does not mention custom URL schemes.
