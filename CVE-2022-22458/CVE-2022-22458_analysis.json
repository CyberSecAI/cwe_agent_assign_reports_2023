It is a child of CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) and CWE-922 (Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information). CWE-522, Insufficiently Protected Credentials, is a class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-523 (Unprotected Transport of Credentials), which highlights the broader category of credential protection issues. While CWE-522 is a parent of CWE-312 through CWE-311, the direct storage of credentials in cleartext is best represented by CWE-312 at the Base level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe922[\"CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe523[\"CWE-523: Unprotected Transport of Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe922\n    cwe311 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe523 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n    class cwe311,cwe922,cwe523 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows: The application **stores user credentials in plain clear text**, which leads to the potential to **read user credentials** by a remote authenticated user. This represents a direct root cause leading to an impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the explicit statement in the vulnerability description that the application \"**stores user credentials in plain clear text**.\" This directly aligns with the description of CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information), which states, \"The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\"\n\nCWE-312 is chosen because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability: the storage of sensitive information (user credentials) in cleartext. The retriever results also list CWE-312 as a highly relevant CWE.\n\nCWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) was considered but deemed less specific. While it is true that storing credentials in cleartext is a form of insufficient protection, CWE-312 provides a more precise description of the **root cause**.\n\nThe selected CWE, CWE-312, is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level for mapping **root causes** according to MITRE's guidelines.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions is not set, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
