While it's a good starting point, the mapping guidance advises examining its children for a better fit. Two potential child CWEs, CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) and CWE-257 (Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format), are considered as possible base-level refinements. CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) is also a parent of CWE-522 but discouraged, as it's too high-level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe257[\"CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe257 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe522 primary\n    class cwe256,cwe257 secondary\n    class cwe668 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficiently protected credentials** (CWE-522), potentially leading to the **plaintext storage of a password** (CWE-256) or storing passwords in a recoverable format (CWE-257). The impact is **information disclosure**, which can be exploited via **network access** by an **unauthenticated user**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed to CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) due to the **rootcause** of the vulnerability being **\"Insufficiently protected credentials.\"** The CWE description aligns with the vulnerability description, as it involves the transmission or storage of authentication credentials using an insecure method. The impact is information disclosure, aligning with the potential consequences of CWE-522.\n\nHowever, since CWE-522 is a Class-level CWE, the analysis also considered its children, CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) and CWE-257 (Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format), to provide a more specific classification. The evidence does not explicitly state that the credentials are stored in plaintext or a recoverable format, but these are strong possibilities given the \"insufficiently protected\" nature of the credentials. Therefore, both CWE-256 and CWE-257 were added as secondary CWEs with slightly lower confidence scores.\n\nCWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) was considered but ultimately deemed too high-level. The mapping guidance for CWE-668 discourages its use as a catch-all and suggests focusing on the specific mistake allowing the resource to be exposed. While technically applicable, CWE-522 and its potential children offer a more precise characterization of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-522, along with the possible refinements of CWE-256 and CWE-257, provides the optimal level of specificity based on the available evidence. The final assessment is primarily based on the provided evidence, specifically the **rootcause** phrase \"**Insufficiently protected credentials**,\" and the retriever results, which highlighted the relevance of CWE-522 and related CWEs.",
