## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-416, a variant of CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference) and CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiration). CWE-416 can be preceded by CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size) or CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition), but neither of these are explicitly mentioned or implied in the vulnerability description. CWE-366 is a base CWE and child of CWE-362 and CWE-662.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **use-after-free** condition, leading to **heap corruption**. The attacker exploits this through user interaction.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly indicates a **use-after-free** condition, which directly corresponds to CWE-416. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" reinforces this with the line "root_cause: Use after free". The primary CWE match for similar CVE descriptions is also CWE-416. The evidence is strong and directly supports the selection of CWE-416.

CWE-366 was considered because **use-after-free** conditions can sometimes be triggered by race conditions. However, the description doesn't explicitly mention or imply a race condition. The vulnerability mentions "user interaction", but that is a vector and not necessarily a race condition. It is possible that a race condition exists internally, but there is no information in the description to support it. Therefore, it is a weaker secondary candidate.

CWE-416 is selected because the vulnerability description explicitly states **"use after free"**, which is the defining characteristic of CWE-416. This is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is the preferred level of abstraction.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-416: Use After Free
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory "belongs" to the code that operates on the new pointer.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Dangling pointer: a pointer that no longer points to valid memory, often after it has been freed

- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).




## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.

### Extended Description


When the product accesses the resource using an incompatible type, this could trigger logical errors because the resource does not have expected properties. In languages without memory safety, such as C and C++, type confusion can lead to out-of-bounds memory access.


While this weakness is frequently associated with unions when parsing data with many different embedded object types in C, it can be present in any application that can interpret the same variable or memory location in multiple ways.


This weakness is not unique to C and C++. For example, errors in PHP applications can be triggered by providing array parameters when scalars are expected, or vice versa. Languages such as Perl, which perform automatic conversion of a variable of one type when it is accessed as if it were another type, can also contain these issues.


### Alternative Terms
Object Type Confusion

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-704
ChildOf -> CWE-704

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

This weakness is possible in any type-unsafe programming language.


**[Research Gap]** 

Type confusion weaknesses have received some attention by applied researchers and major software vendors for C and C++ code. Some publicly-reported vulnerabilities probably have type confusion as a root-cause weakness, but these may be described as "memory corruption" instead.


For other languages, there are very few public reports of type confusion weaknesses. These are probably under-studied. Since many programs rely directly or indirectly on loose typing, a potential "type confusion" behavior might be intentional, possibly requiring more manual analysis.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2010-4577:** Type confusion in CSS sequence leads to out-of-bounds read.
- **CVE-2011-0611:** Size inconsistency allows code execution, first discovered when it was actively exploited in-the-wild.
- **CVE-2010-0258:** Improperly-parsed file containing records of different types leads to code execution when a memory location is interpreted as a different object than intended.




## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

### Extended Description


A race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.


A race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:


  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.

  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.

A race condition exists when an "interfering code sequence" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.

The interfering code sequence could be "trusted" or "untrusted." A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.


### Alternative Terms

CanPrecede -> CWE-416

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed. They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.

**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.

**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.

**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.
- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-1021: Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The web application does not restrict or incorrectly restricts frame objects or UI layers that belong to another application or domain, which can lead to user confusion about which interface the user is interacting with.

### Extended Description
A web application is expected to place restrictions on whether it is allowed to be rendered within frames, iframes, objects, embed or applet elements. Without the restrictions, users can be tricked into interacting with the application when they were not intending to.

### Alternative Terms
Clickjacking
UI Redress Attack
Tapjacking: "Tapjacking" is similar to clickjacking, except it is used for mobile applications in which the user "taps" the application instead of performing a mouse click.

- **CVE-2017-5697:** Hardware/firmware product has insufficient clickjacking protection in its web user interface
- **CVE-2017-4015:** Clickjacking in data-loss prevention product via HTTP response header.




## CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition.

### Extended Description


Race conditions frequently occur in signal handlers, since signal handlers support asynchronous actions. These race conditions have a variety of root causes and symptoms. Attackers may be able to exploit a signal handler race condition to cause the product state to be corrupted, possibly leading to a denial of service or even code execution.


These issues occur when non-reentrant functions, or state-sensitive actions occur in the signal handler, where they may be called at any time. These behaviors can violate assumptions being made by the "regular" code that is interrupted, or by other signal handlers that may also be invoked. If these functions are called at an inopportune moment - such as while a non-reentrant function is already running - memory corruption could occur that may be exploitable for code execution. Another signal race condition commonly found occurs when free is called within a signal handler, resulting in a double free and therefore a write-what-where condition. Even if a given pointer is set to NULL after it has been freed, a race condition still exists between the time the memory was freed and the pointer was set to NULL. This is especially problematic if the same signal handler has been set for more than one signal -- since it means that the signal handler itself may be reentered.


There are several known behaviors related to signal handlers that have received the label of "signal handler race condition":


  - Shared state (e.g. global data or static variables) that are accessible to both a signal handler and "regular" code

  - Shared state between a signal handler and other signal handlers

  - Use of non-reentrant functionality within a signal handler - which generally implies that shared state is being used. For example, malloc() and free() are non-reentrant because they may use global or static data structures for managing memory, and they are indirectly used by innocent-seeming functions such as syslog(); these functions could be exploited for memory corruption and, possibly, code execution.

  - Association of the same signal handler function with multiple signals - which might imply shared state, since the same code and resources are accessed. For example, this can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.

  - Use of setjmp and longjmp, or other mechanisms that prevent a signal handler from returning control back to the original functionality

  - While not technically a race condition, some signal handlers are designed to be called at most once, and being called more than once can introduce security problems, even when there are not any concurrent calls to the signal handler. This can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.

Signal handler vulnerabilities are often classified based on the absence of a specific protection mechanism, although this style of classification is discouraged in CWE because programmers often have a choice of several different mechanisms for addressing the weakness. Such protection mechanisms may preserve exclusivity of access to the shared resource, and behavioral atomicity for the relevant code:

  - Avoiding shared state

  - Using synchronization in the signal handler

  - Using synchronization in the regular code

  - Disabling or masking other signals, which provides atomicity (which effectively ensures exclusivity)

- **CVE-2001-1349:** unsafe calls to library functions from signal handler




## CWE-665: Improper Initialization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.

### Extended Description
This can have security implications when the associated resource is expected to have certain properties or values, such as a variable that determines whether a user has been authenticated or not.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-1471:** chain: an invalid value prevents a library file from being included, skipping initialization of key variables, leading to resultant eval injection.
- **CVE-2008-3637:** Improper error checking in protection mechanism produces an uninitialized variable, allowing security bypass and code execution.
- **CVE-2008-4197:** Use of uninitialized memory may allow code execution.




## CWE-415: Double Free
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.

### Extended Description
When a program calls free() twice with the same argument, the program's memory management data structures become corrupted. This corruption can cause the program to crash or, in some circumstances, cause two later calls to malloc() to return the same pointer. If malloc() returns the same value twice and the program later gives the attacker control over the data that is written into this doubly-allocated memory, the program becomes vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.

### Alternative Terms
Double-free

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is usually resultant from another weakness, such as an unhandled error or race condition between threads. It could also be primary to weaknesses such as buffer overflows.

**[Theoretical]** It could be argued that Double Free would be most appropriately located as a child of "Use after Free", but "Use" and "Release" are considered to be distinct operations within vulnerability theory, therefore this is more accurately "Release of a Resource after Expiration or Release", which doesn't exist yet.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2006-5051:** Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).
- **CVE-2004-0642:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.
- **CVE-2004-0772:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.




## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

### Extended Description
When a resource is created or allocated, the developer is responsible for properly releasing the resource as well as accounting for all potential paths of expiration or invalidation, such as a set period of time or revocation.
