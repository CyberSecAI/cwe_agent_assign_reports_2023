It is related to CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation) through a ChildOf relationship. CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is a related Base CWE and a ChildOf CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). An Off-by-one Error (CWE-193) can lead to an Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe193[\"CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe682[\"CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe193 -->|CHILDOF| cwe682\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe193 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe125\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe193 primary\n    class cwe125,cwe682,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **off-by-one error** (CWE-193) in the `decode_rle_span` function, which leads to an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125). This **out-of-bounds read** of heap metadata results in sensitive information leakage.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis identified an **heap out-of-bounds read** vulnerability due to an **off-by-one error** in OpenImageIO. The provided vulnerability description, key phrases, and CVE reference links content summary all point to this conclusion.\n\nThe evidence shows:\n- Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: \"**weakness:** **heap out-of-bounds read**\"\n- CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"root cause is an **off-by-one error** in the `decode_rle_span` function ... leading to an **out-of-bounds read**.\"\n\nCWE-193 (Off-by-one Error) is the primary cause as the vulnerability stems from an increment of the index `e` before accessing the `encoded` buffer. This error directly results in reading data beyond the intended buffer, making CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) a secondary weakness.\n\nThe retriever results also support this assessment, with CWE-193 and CWE-125 being among the top-ranked CWEs. The hierarchical relationships and chain patterns (CWE-193 can precede CWE-125) further solidify this classification.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error) capturing the root cause and CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) describing the direct consequence of this error. Other considered CWEs, such as CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) and CWE-197 (Numeric Truncation Error), were deemed less relevant as the primary issue isn't related to integer overflow or truncation, but rather an incorrect increment that leads to reading beyond buffer boundaries.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
