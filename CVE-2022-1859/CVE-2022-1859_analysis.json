It is a child of CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference) and CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiration). The description explicitly mentions \"Use after free\" which makes CWE-416 a strong match.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource after Expiration\"]\n    \n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe825,cwe672 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **use-after-free** condition which leads to **heap corruption** that can be exploited by a remote attacker.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the root cause is \"use after free.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section also confirms this. The retriever results list CWE-416 as the top candidate. CWE-416 is a Variant level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. The mapping guidance for CWE-416 states that it is ALLOWED and to carefully read the name and description to ensure that the mapping is an appropriate fit. The description of CWE-416 perfectly matches the vulnerability description. Therefore, CWE-416 is the most appropriate CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE was considered but not selected because the vulnerability is not about improper resource shutdown or release, but rather using memory after it has been freed.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE was considered but not selected because the vulnerability is not about sensitive information being leaked, but rather using memory after it has been freed.\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE was considered but not selected because there is no explicit mention of a race condition in the description, although race conditions can sometimes *lead* to use-after-free vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE was considered but not selected because the vulnerability is not related to improper locking mechanisms.\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE was considered but not selected because it is too high level.\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE was considered but not selected because the vulnerability does not directly involve improper synchronization between threads.\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE was considered but not selected because there's no explicit mention of race conditions, even though they can sometimes lead to use-after-free.\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE was considered but not selected because the vulnerability is not related to improper initialization.\n\n## CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE was considered but not

sparse\nThis CWE was considered but not selected because there is no explicit mention of a race condition.\n\n## CWE-415: Double Free\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 5585.22\n**Source**: sparse\nThis CWE was considered but not selected because the vulnerability is not about freeing the same memory twice, but rather using memory after it has been freed.\n\n## CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 5467.55\n**Source**: sparse\nThis CWE was considered but not selected because the vulnerability is not related to signal handler race conditions.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 5402.98\n**Source**: sparse\nThis CWE was considered but not selected because the vulnerability is not related to improper locking.\n\n## CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 5.03\n**Source**: graph\nThis CWE was considered but not selected because while it *can* be a consequence of use-after-free, it is not the primary weakness described.\n\n## CWE-416: Use After Free\n**Abstraction Level**: variant\n**Similarity Score**: 4.53\n**Source**: graph\nThis is the selected CWE, as justified above.\n\n## CWE-415: Double Free\n**Abstraction Level**: variant\n**Similarity Score**:

Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n**Source**: graph\nThis CWE was considered but not selected because the vulnerability is not related to signal handlers.\n\n## CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n**Source**: graph\nThis CWE was considered but not selected because the vulnerability is not a classic buffer overflow.\n\n## CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n**Source**: graph\nThis CWE was considered, but CWE-416 is a child of CWE-825 and is more specific.\n\n## CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n**Source**: graph\nThis CWE was considered but not selected because the vulnerability does not specifically involve a null pointer dereference.\n\n## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n**Source**: graph\nThis CWE
