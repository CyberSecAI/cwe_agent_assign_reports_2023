The secondary CWEs are CWE-1284 [Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input] and CWE-1285 [Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input] both of which are Base-level CWEs. CWE-1284 and CWE-1285 are both children of CWE-20 [Improper Input Validation]. This relationship shows that the specific type of input validation issue relates to quantities, indexes, positions, or offsets, which can lead to resource consumption issues and ultimately a denial of service.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    cwe1285[\"CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe1284 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe1285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20    \n    cwe400 -->|RELATED| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe1284,cwe1285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **invalid input**, specifically an **invalid sequence number** or other **invalid input**. The **improper or missing validation** of this input (CWE-1284, CWE-1285) leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400), ultimately resulting in a **denial of service**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the potential for denial of service. The description states, \"Several denial of service vulnerabilities exist in Eternal Terminal prior to version 6.2.0, including a DoS triggered remotely by an **invalid sequence number** and a local bug triggered by **invalid input** sent directly to the IPC socket.\" The root cause is the **improper validation** of the **invalid input**, whether it's an **invalid sequence number** or other malformed data. The lack of validation allows the application to consume excessive resources, leading to the DoS.\n\nCWE-400 [Uncontrolled Resource Consumption] is chosen as the primary CWE because the stated impact is a \"denial of service,\" which directly aligns with uncontrolled resource consumption. This is a Class-level CWE.\n\nCWE-1284 [Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input] and CWE-1285 [Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input] are chosen as secondary CWEs because the **invalid input** could represent an improperly specified quantity, index, position, or offset. The vulnerability description mentions an **invalid sequence number**, which can be interpreted as an invalid quantity. Additionally, other **invalid input** sent to the IPC socket could represent invalid indices or positions. These are Base-level CWEs.\n\nThe retriever results showed other CWEs with high relevance scores, such as CWE-120 [Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input] and CWE-407 [Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity]. However, these CWEs are not as directly relevant as CWE-400, CWE-1284, and CWE-1285 based on the provided description. The description does not explicitly mention a buffer overflow or algorithmic complexity issues, only **invalid input** leading to denial of service.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:",
