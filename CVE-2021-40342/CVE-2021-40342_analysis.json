It is a child of CWE-1392 (Use of Default Credentials). CWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength) is a class-level weakness and a child of CWE-693.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1394[\"CWE-1394: Use of Default Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe1392[\"CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\"]\n    cwe326[\"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n\n    cwe1394 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1392\n    cwe326 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1394 primary\n    class cwe326 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a default key for encryption** (CWE-1394), which leads to the ability to **obtain sensitive information and gain access to network elements**. The reliance on a default key weakens the encryption strength (CWE-326), making it easier for attackers to compromise the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **use of a default key for encryption**, which directly corresponds to CWE-1394 (Use of Default Cryptographic Key). The vulnerability description clearly states this **rootcause**, and the retriever results also list CWE-1394 as the top candidate. The mapping guidance for CWE-1394 allows its use and confirms its appropriateness as a base-level weakness.\n\nThe vulnerability description also implies that the encryption is weak because of the default key, so CWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength) is considered as a secondary weakness.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is: \"**use of default key for encryption**.\"\n\nCWE-1394 is selected because it directly addresses the **rootcause** described in the vulnerability. The relationship analysis confirms that it is a base-level weakness, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\nCWE-326 is added as a secondary weakness because using a default key inherently reduces the encryption strength. While CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) was considered, the description focuses more on the weakness of the key rather than the algorithm itself.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1394: Use of Default Cryptographic Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a default cryptographic key for potentially critical functionality.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses default credentials (such as passwords or cryptographic keys) for potentially critical functionality.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product violates well-established principles for secure design.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
