CWE-22 and CWE-73 are base-level CWEs and children of CWE-706, which represents a failure to protect the intended sphere of control. CWE-20 can precede CWE-22. CWE-73 can precede CWE-59 and CWE-434.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    cwe59[\"CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\"]\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    \n    cwe22 -->|CHILDOF| cwe706\n    cwe73 -->|CHILDOF| cwe706\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe22\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe59\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe434\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe22,cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper Input Validation (CWE-20)**, which leads to external control of a filename or path (CWE-73). This can then result in the ability to delete arbitrary files. The **improper Input Validation** allows an attacker to control the path, leading to the deletion of unintended files.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-20 as the primary weakness due to the **improper Input Validation vulnerability**. The retriever results and the provided description both point towards **improper Input Validation**. CWE-22, **Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**, is a secondary weakness, as it describes the specific type of **improper Input Validation** leading to path traversal. CWE-73 is also considered as a secondary weakness because it describes the **external control of file name or path**.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision by highlighting the connections between **improper Input Validation** and path traversal related CWEs.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-20 represents the general **improper Input Validation**, while CWE-22 and CWE-73 provide more context about the type of **improper Input Validation** that leads to path traversal.\n\nThe evidence is the following: \"The **improper Input Validation vulnerability** in Move folder to Trash feature of Apache Zeppelin allows an attacker to delete the arbitrary files.\"\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
