Since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"relative path traversal\", CWE-23 is the more accurate and specific choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe23[\"CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n\n    cwe23 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe23 primary\n    class cwe22 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward: the **relative path traversal** weakness allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files, leading to full control of the device.\n  - The root cause is the **relative path traversal**.\n  - The impact is reading arbitrary files and gaining full control of the device.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the provided vulnerability description and the summary of the CVE reference links. The key phrase \"**relative path traversal**\" strongly suggests CWE-23 as the primary weakness. The retriever results also list CWE-22 and CWE-23 as highly relevant, but the explicit mention of \"relative\" in the description makes CWE-23 the more precise mapping.\n\nThe evidence directly supports the selection of CWE-23. \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section lists the weakness as \"**relative path traversal**\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also confirms that \"**The vulnerability is due to a relative path traversal flaw**.\"\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-23 is a specific type of CWE-22.
