CWE-798 is a more general case that encompasses various types of hard-coded credentials, while CWE-259 specifically focuses on hard-coded passwords. The vulnerability description clearly states the use of **hard-coded passwords**, making CWE-259 the more specific and appropriate choice. Both CWE-259 and CWE-798 are related to authentication issues, but CWE-259 provides a finer-grained classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1391\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe259 primary\n    class cwe798 secondary\n    class cwe1391 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause**, which is the presence of **hard-coded passwords**. This leads to the weakness, which is the ability for a remote attacker to log in to the database with unrestricted access, ultimately impacting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data.\n\nHardcoded Password -> Unauthenticated Access -> Database Compromise\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** of the vulnerability and mapping it to the most appropriate CWE. The vulnerability description clearly indicates the use of **hard-coded passwords**, which directly corresponds to CWE-259. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further supports this by explicitly stating \"Use of Hard-coded Password (CWE-259)\". While CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) is a broader category, CWE-259 provides a more specific classification.\n\nThe relationship analysis confirms that CWE-259 is a variant of CWE-798, making it the preferred choice due to its higher level of specificity. The mapping guidance for both CWEs allows their use, further solidifying the decision. The evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary provides a high level of confidence in the selected mapping.\n\nThe decision is based on the provided evidence: \"Sewios Real-Time Location System (RTLS) Studio version 2.0.0 up to and including version 2.6.2 contains **hard-coded passwords** for select users in the applications database.\" and \"Weakness: Use of Hard-coded Password (CWE-259)\".\n\nCWE-259 is selected because it is the most specific and accurate representation of the **root cause** described in the vulnerability. It is a Variant level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
