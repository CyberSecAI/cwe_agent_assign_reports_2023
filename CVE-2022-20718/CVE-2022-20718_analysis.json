Specifically, the `interface` field within the `package.yaml` file is not properly validated.\"\n- \"**Parameter Injection:** The lack of proper sanitization of the 'interface' field allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into this field.\"\n- \"**Command Injection:** The injected commands are then executed by the underlying operating system by passing to the shell.\"\n- \"**Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code as *root* on the underlying host operating system. This grants them full control over the affected device.\"\n\nBased on this evidence, CWE-78 is the most appropriate primary CWE, as it accurately describes the **improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command**, leading to command injection.\n\nCWE-20 is considered as a secondary CWE since the root cause started with the **improper input validation** that led to the **OS Command Injection**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-78 being a Base-level CWE and CWE-20 being a Class-level CWE that captures the broader context of improper input validation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Similarity Score**: 5.03\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.143\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287].
