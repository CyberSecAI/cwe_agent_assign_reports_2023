CWE-362 is a class-level CWE, while CWE-416 is a variant. CWE-362 can precede CWE-416. CWE-416 is a child of CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe362 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe416\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe416 secondary\n    class cwe825 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition** (CWE-362) which leads to a **use after free** (CWE-416).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a clear chain of events, starting with a **race condition** that results in a **use after free** vulnerability.\n*   The vulnerability description states \"In apusys, there is a possible **use after free** due to a **race condition**.\"\n*   The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms: \"**CWE-362**: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition').\" and \"The race condition leads to a use-after-free scenario, which is a memory corruption issue.\"\n*   The primary CWE match from similar CVE descriptions is CWE-787, which is incorrect. The correct mapping is CWE-362 leading to CWE-416.\n*   The retriever results list CWE-362 as the top combined result.\n*   CWE-362 is a Class, and the Mapping Guidance suggests examining children of this entry to see if there is a better fit. However, in this case, the race condition itself is the primary issue, making CWE-362 appropriate as a Class. CWE-416 is a Variant.\n*   The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, accurately reflecting the root cause and resulting vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that generates incorrect or unintended results that are later used in security-critical decisions or resource management.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. In many cases, lower-level children or descendants are more appropriate. However, sometimes this weakness is forced to be used due to the lack of in-depth weakness research.
