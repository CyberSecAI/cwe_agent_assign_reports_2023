# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-20238

## Vulnerability Description
It was found in OpenShift Container Platform 4 that ignition config, served by the Machine Config Server, can be **accessed externally from clusters without authentication**. The MCS endpoint (port 22623) provides ignition configuration used for bootstrapping Nodes and can include some sensitive data, e.g. registry pull secrets. There are two scenarios where this data can be accessed. The first is on Baremetal, OpenStack, Ovirt, Vsphere and KubeVirt deployments which do not have a separate internal API endpoint and allow access from outside the cluster to port 22623 from the standard OpenShift API Virtual IP address. The second is on cloud deployments when using unsupported network plugins, which do not create iptables rules that prevent to port 22623. In this scenario, the ignition config is exposed to all pods within the cluster and cannot be accessed externally.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **accessed externally from clusters without authentication**
- **vector:** accessed from outside the cluster to port 22623 from the standard OpenShift API Virtual IP address
- **product:** OpenShift Container Platform
- **version:** 4
- **component:** Machine Config Server

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The Machine Config Server (MCS) in OpenShift Container Platform exposes an endpoint (port 22623) that provides ignition configurations for bootstrapping nodes. This endpoint was found to be accessible without authentication in certain scenarios.
*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper network security configurations, specifically the absence of iptables rules to block access to the MCS endpoint for non-Red Hat supported network plugins (like Calico).
*   Also, certain deployment types (Baremetal, OpenStack, Ovirt, Vsphere, and KubeVirt) allow external access to the MCS endpoint (port 22623) from the standard OpenShift API Virtual IP address.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The primary weakness is the lack of authentication on the MCS endpoint, allowing unauthorized access to potentially sensitive data.
*   **Insufficient Network Security:** The reliance on network plugin implementations for securing access to the MCS endpoint means that clusters using unsupported plugins are vulnerable to internal attacks.
*   **External Exposure:** Certain deployment configurations expose the MCS endpoint to external access, creating a wider attack surface.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can access ignition configurations, which may contain sensitive data such as registry pull secrets used for bootstrapping nodes.
*   **Potential for further attacks:** The exposed sensitive data could be used to compromise the cluster.
*   **Internal cluster compromise:** If an unsupported network plugin is used in cloud deployments, all pods within the cluster could gain access to the ignition config.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **External Access:** Attackers can directly access the MCS endpoint (port 22623) from outside the cluster on certain deployment types, via the OpenShift API Virtual IP address.
*   **Internal Access:** Applications or pods within the cluster can access the MCS endpoint if using a non-Red Hat supported network plugin without proper iptables rules to block access to the MCS endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   For external access, the attacker needs network connectivity to the OpenShift API Virtual IP address on port 22623.
*   For internal access, the attacker requires the ability to run code within a pod inside the cluster, or have the ability to access the MCS endpoint from within the cluster, if not using a Red Hat supported network plugin.
*   No authentication is needed to retrieve the ignition configuration via the exposed port.

## CWE-1327: Binding to an Unrestricted IP Address
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product assigns the address 0.0.0.0 for a database server, a cloud service/instance, or any computing resource that communicates remotely.

### Extended Description


When a server binds to the address 0.0.0.0, it allows connections from every IP address on the local machine, effectively exposing the server to every possible network. This might be much broader access than intended by the developer or administrator, who might only be expecting the server to be reachable from a single interface/network.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21947:** Desktop manager for Kubernetes and container management binds a service to 0.0.0.0, allowing users on the network to make requests to a dashboard API.




## CWE-322: Key Exchange without Entity Authentication
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product performs a key exchange with an actor without verifying the identity of that actor.

### Extended Description
Performing a key exchange will preserve the integrity of the information sent between two entities, but this will not guarantee that the entities are who they claim they are. This may enable an attacker to impersonate an actor by modifying traffic between the two entities. Typically, this involves a victim client that contacts a malicious server that is impersonating a trusted server. If the client skips authentication or ignores an authentication failure, the malicious server may request authentication information from the user. The malicious server can then use this authentication information to log in to the trusted server using the victim's credentials, sniff traffic between the victim and trusted server, etc.

## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.

### Extended Description


Limited resources include memory, file system storage, database connection pool entries, and CPU. If an attacker can trigger the allocation of these limited resources, but the number or size of the resources is not controlled, then the attacker could cause a denial of service that consumes all available resources. This would prevent valid users from accessing the product, and it could potentially have an impact on the surrounding environment. For example, a memory exhaustion attack against an application could slow down the application as well as its host operating system.


There are at least three distinct scenarios which can commonly lead to resource exhaustion:


  - Lack of throttling for the number of allocated resources

  - Losing all references to a resource before reaching the shutdown stage

  - Not closing/returning a resource after processing

Resource exhaustion problems are often result due to an incorrect implementation of the following situations:

  - Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.

  - Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.



### Alternative Terms
Resource Exhaustion

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-664

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the "technical impact" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is causing resource consumption, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake. Consider children/descendants such as CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling, CWE-771: Missing Reference to Active Allocated Resource, CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool, CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime, CWE-834: Excessive Iteration, CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification), and others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** "Resource consumption" could be interpreted as a consequence instead of an insecure behavior, so this entry is being considered for modification. It appears to be referenced too frequently when more precise mappings are available. Some of its children, such as CWE-771, might be better considered as a chain.

**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. "Resource exhaustion" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.

**[Other]** 

Database queries that take a long time to process are good DoS targets. An attacker would have to write a few lines of Perl code to generate enough traffic to exceed the site's ability to keep up. This would effectively prevent authorized users from using the site at all. Resources can be exploited simply by ensuring that the target machine must do much more work and consume more resources in order to service a request than the attacker must do to initiate a request.


A prime example of this can be found in old switches that were vulnerable to "macof" attacks (so named for a tool developed by Dugsong). These attacks flooded a switch with random IP and MAC address combinations, therefore exhausting the switch's cache, which held the information of which port corresponded to which MAC addresses. Once this cache was exhausted, the switch would fail in an insecure way and would begin to act simply as a hub, broadcasting all traffic on all ports and allowing for basic sniffing attacks.


**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2020-7218:** Go-based workload orchestrator does not limit resource usage with unauthenticated connections, allowing a DoS by flooding the service
- **CVE-2020-3566:** Resource exhaustion in distributed OS because of "insufficient" IGMP queue management, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

### Extended Description


Attackers may be able to bypass weak authentication faster and/or with less effort than expected.
