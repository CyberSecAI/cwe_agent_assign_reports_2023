It is a ChildOf CWE-319.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe614[\"CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe614 -->|CHILDOF| cwe319\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe614 primary\n    class cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing secure attribute** on a sensitive cookie, leading to the potential for the cookie to be transmitted in cleartext and accessed by unauthorized parties.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Missing secure attribute** (CWE-614)\n  - **Impact:** Cookie accessible to attackers.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a high confidence in mapping the vulnerability to CWE-614. The **root cause** is a **missing secure attribute** for sensitive cookies in an HTTPS session. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-614.\n\nThe evidence for this assessment is primarily based on the following:\n- **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**: \"**rootcause:** **missing secure attribute**\"\n- **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**: \"The vulnerability is due to the System Configuration Tool (SCT) not setting the \"Secure\" attribute for sensitive cookies transmitted over HTTPS.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-614 is at the optimal level of specificity (Variant), as it directly describes the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\nNot Selected: This CWE is not directly related to the **missing secure attribute** of a cookie.\n\n## CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions is not set, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\nSELECTED: This CWE perfectly describes the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\nNot Selected: While related, as CWE-614 is a ChildOf CWE-319, CWE-614 is more specific.\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\nNot Selected: This vulnerability deals with transmission, not storage.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\nNot Selected: The issue is not about removing sensitive information but about transmitting cookies without the secure attribute.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\nNot Selected: This CWE is too general.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\nNot Selected: Not related to authentication algorithms.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\nNot Selected: Not related to files or directories.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\nNot Selected: Not related to data authenticity.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\nNot Selected: Not related to weak credentials.\n\n## CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 5338.15\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions is not set, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session.\nSELECTED: Repeated for clarity.
