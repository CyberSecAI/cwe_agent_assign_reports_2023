It is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **improper length check** which leads to **memory corruption** due to an out-of-bounds write.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the root cause is an **improper length check while copying into memory**, leading to **memory corruption**.\n\nThe Retriever Results list CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as the top match with a score of 1.0. The description of CWE-787 aligns perfectly with the vulnerability, as it involves writing data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer due to the **improper length check**. The \"Alternative Terms\" for CWE-787 includes \"Memory Corruption\", which is mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n\nCWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) was considered but not selected as the root cause is more directly an out-of-bounds write than an improper quantity.\n\nCWE-787 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level. The mapping guidance for CWE-787 states that its usage is \"Allowed\" and it is at a preferred level of abstraction.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence, the relationship analysis, and the mapping guidance, the most appropriate CWE is CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write).",
