It is a child of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials), a class-level CWE. CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) is related via the CanAlsoBe relationship to CWE-523 (Unprotected Transport of Credentials), which is also a child of CWE-522. Choosing CWE-256 provides a more specific classification of the vulnerability than using its parent class CWE-522.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe523[\"CWE-523: Unprotected Transport of Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe523 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe523 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe312\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe312,cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **plain-text password storage**, which leads to the disclosure of user credentials. A local attacker can then use these credentials to access the vulnerable application's database with the privileges of the compromised account.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **plain-text password storage** as the root cause. The Retriever results strongly suggested CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) and CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information).\n\nThe vulnerability description states \"Dell EMC Repository Manager version 3.4.0 contains a **plain-text password storage** vulnerability.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this: \"Dell EMC Repository Manager version 3.4.0 stores certain user credentials in plain text.\" This direct evidence supports the selection of CWE-256.\n\nCWE-256 is a more precise classification than its parent CWE-522, which is a Class level CWE. It is also slightly preferred over CWE-312 because the vulnerability description specifically mentions passwords being stored in plain text. While CWE-312 is a valid consideration (as passwords are sensitive information), CWE-256 directly addresses the password storage aspect. Therefore, CWE-256 is the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-836: Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product records password hashes in a data store, receives a hash of a password from a client, and compares the supplied hash to the hash obtained from the data store.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a one-way cryptographic hash against an input that should not be reversible, such as a password, but the product does not also use a salt as part of the input.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users.
