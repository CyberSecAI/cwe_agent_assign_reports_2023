This is a Class-level CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the Jenkins Katalon Plugin **does not perform permission checks** in several HTTP endpoints. This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-862, where a product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\nCWE-862 is a child of CWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**), but CWE-862 is more specific and thus more appropriate.\n\nThe analysis also considered a chain relationship with CWE-522 (**Insufficiently Protected Credentials**), where the missing authorization leads to exposure of credentials. While the impact includes capturing credentials, the root cause is the lack of permission checks.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CANLEADTO| cwe522\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events for this vulnerability is:\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-862 (**Missing Authorization**) - The plugin **does not perform permission checks** on HTTP endpoints.\n2.  **Impact:** This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to attacker-specified URLs using attacker-specified credential IDs, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins. This can be viewed as a case of CWE-522 (**Insufficiently Protected Credentials**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and supporting evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which clearly states that the root cause is a **missing authorization** check.\n\nThe vulnerability description key phrases explicitly mentions \"**does not perform permission checks**\" as the root cause. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating \"**Missing Authorization:** The plugin lacks proper authorization checks on its HTTP endpoints\".\n\nThe retriever results also lists CWE-862 (**Missing Authorization**) as the top candidate.\n\nThe relationship graph shows the hierarchical relationship between CWE-862 and its parent, CWE-285, and the potential chain relationship leading to CWE-522.\n\nCWE-862 is selected because it accurately describes the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **lack of authorization checks**. While CWE-522 could describe the impact, it's more accurate to focus on the underlying weakness.\n\nCWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**) was considered but rejected because the vulnerability is not about performing the check incorrectly, but about not performing it at all.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n*   CWE-862 (**Missing Authorization**): The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n*   CWE-522 (**Insufficiently Protected Credentials**): The product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.",
