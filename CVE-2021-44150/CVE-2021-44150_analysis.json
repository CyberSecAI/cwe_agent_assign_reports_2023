CWE-328 is a child of both CWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength) and CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm). The secondary CWE selected is CWE-345 (Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity), which is a Class level CWE and parent to CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n    cwe326[\"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n\n    cwe328 -->|CHILDOF| cwe326\n    cwe328 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe328 primary\n    class cwe345 secondary\n    class cwe326,cwe327,cwe347 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **reliance on a weak hash function (SHA-1)** which makes the implementation vulnerable to collision attacks and data spoofing, leading to a potential compromise of data integrity.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability description indicates that the client in tusdotnet through 2.5.0 **relies on SHA-1 to prevent spoofing of file content**. The key phrase indicates the **weakness** is that the code **relies on SHA-1**.\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" expands on this, stating that the root cause is that the `tusdotnet` library uses the SHA-1 hashing algorithm for checksum verification during file uploads. It explains SHA-1 is considered cryptographically broken and is not collision resistant, making it vulnerable to attacks that could manipulate the checksum.\n\nThe Retriever Results also show CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash) with the highest score.\n\nTherefore, the primary CWE is CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash) because the application uses a hashing algorithm (SHA-1) that is considered weak and cryptographically broken, making it susceptible to collision attacks. This directly aligns with the description of CWE-328, which states that the product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function. The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate file content without detection, as the manipulated file would still have a valid SHA-1 checksum. This has security implications for data integrity and potential file tampering.\n\nCWE-345 (Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity) was considered as a secondary CWE because the reliance on SHA-1 leads to insufficient verification of the data's origin or authenticity. While this is a valid concern, CWE-328 more directly addresses the root cause, which is the use of a weak hashing algorithm. CWE-345 is a Class level CWE, and the guidance suggests that lower level CWEs should be used when possible.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.

This makes it easier for attackers to trick users into inflicting damage to their system.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
