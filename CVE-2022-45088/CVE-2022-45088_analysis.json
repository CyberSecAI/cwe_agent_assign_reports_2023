It's a variant and thus more specific than its parents. CWE-20 is a class-level weakness and is too general. The retriever results also show CWE-98 with a good score, supporting its selection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe98[\"CWE-98: Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion')\"]\n    cwe706[\"CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Critical Data\"]\n    cwe829[\"CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe426[\"CWE-426: Untrusted Search Path\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n\n    cwe98 -->|ChildOf| cwe706\n    cwe98 -->|ChildOf| cwe829\n    cwe98 -->|CanPrecede| cwe94\n    cwe98 -->|CanAlsoBe| cwe426\n    cwe98 -->|CanFollow| cwe73\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe98 primary\n    class cwe706,cwe829,cwe94,cwe426, cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Input Validation** which leads to PHP Local File Inclusion. The code **fails to properly sanitize** the filename used in an `include` or `require` statement, allowing the attacker to include arbitrary local files.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed towards **Improper Input Validation**, but the provided information leans more towards **Improper Control of Filename** in the specific context of PHP file inclusion. The vulnerability description explicitly states \"PHP Local File Inclusion\" which is the impact, and \"Improper Input Validation\" as the root cause. However, the retriever results and the description of CWE-98 aligns more accurately with the scenario. The root cause is that the application **does not restrict or incorrectly restricts the input** before its usage in \"require,\" \"include,\" or similar functions.\n\nCWE-98 is a Variant level CWE and more specific than CWE-20, which is a Class level CWE.\nThe evidence is the **Improper Input Validation** vulnerability in Group Arge Energy and Control Systems Smartpower Web allows PHP Local File Inclusion.\nThe weakness is at the optimal level of specificity because it highlights the specific issue of uncontrolled filenames in PHP include/require statements leading to local file inclusion.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-24: Path Traversal: '../filedir'\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize \"../\" sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as \"/abs/path\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
