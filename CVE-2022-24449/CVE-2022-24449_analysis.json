The crafted XML document contains **XXE** payloads. The **XXE** allows for information disclosure and **SSRF** attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is due to the application **not validating the presence of a license**, which leads to the acceptance of a crafted XML document containing **XXE** payloads. The **XXE** allows for information disclosure and **SSRF** attacks.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"Solar appScreener through 3.10.4, when a valid license is not present, allows **XXE** and SSRF attacks via a crafted XML document.\"\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states: \"The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) references within the Solar AppScreener license update mechanism. Specifically, the tool does not properly restrict the parsing of external entities in XML files provided by users during the license update process.\"\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also states: \"The application fails to properly validate or sanitize user-supplied XML files, leading to the ability to inject malicious XML payloads.\"\n\nThe primary weakness is CWE-611 (**CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference**) because the application fails to restrict XML external entities.\nCWE-611 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The mapping guidance for CWE-611 states: \"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\"\nThe retriever results list CWE-611 as the top combined result, with a score of 1.0.\n\nA secondary weakness is CWE-918 (**CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**) because the **XXE** can be used to perform a server side request forgery.\nCWE-918 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The mapping guidance for CWE-918 states: \"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\"\n\nCWE-502 (**CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data**) was considered because XML is used to serialize data. However, the vulnerability is not due to deserialization of untrusted data, but rather due to the improper handling of XML external entities.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
