The relationships of CWE-862 include being a child of CWE-285 **Improper Authorization** and CWE-284 **Improper Access Control**. The retriever also identified CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** which is a peer to CWE-862. The secondary CWE is CWE-73 **External Control of File Name or Path**. CWE-73 is related to CWE-22 **Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')** through the CANFOLLOW relationship.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe22\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe73 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284,cwe22 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission check** (CWE-862) which allows attackers to perform unauthorized actions such as connecting to an attacker-specified host (CWE-73), disabling SSL/TLS validation, and testing rollbacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** as the primary weakness due to the **lack of permission checks** in the affected endpoints. This aligns with the vulnerability description stating the plugin **\"does not perform a permission check\"**. The retriever results also listed CWE-862 as the top candidate. The provided evidence clearly supports this classification.\n\n> Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n> - **rootcause:** **does not perform a permission check**\n\nWhile CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** was also considered, CWE-862 is more appropriate because the vulnerability lies in the complete absence of a permission check rather than an incorrectly implemented one.\n\nAdditionally, CWE-73 **External Control of File Name or Path** was added as a secondary CWE because the missing authorization allows the attacker to connect to an attacker-specified host. The attacker has control over the host.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-862 is a Class-level CWE, however, there were no Base-level children that were a better fit.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
