Additionally, CWE-290 can be related to CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature) when the spoofing occurs due to signature flaws. Thus, the hierarchical relationship is that CWE-290 is a child of CWE-1390.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe290[\"CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\"]\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe290 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe290 primary\n    class cwe347,cwe1390 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an inconsistency in JWT parsing, leading to token forgery. This allows an attacker to bypass authentication and spoof identities, ultimately resulting in session hijacking.\n\n`Inconsistency in JWT parsing` -> `Token Forgery` -> `Authentication Bypass by Spoofing (CWE-290)` -> `Identity Spoofing & Session Hijacking`\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly suggests CWE-290 as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description explicitly mentioning \"**Authentication Bypass by Spoofing**.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating that an attacker with a valid JWT can forge its contents, leading to identity spoofing and authentication bypass.\n\nThe relationship graph reinforces this by showing that CWE-290 is a specific type of CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) and can be related to CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature).\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-290 directly reflects the stated vulnerability, and it's a base-level CWE, which is preferred. While CWE-1390 is a parent, it's less specific. CWE-347 is included as a secondary CWE, as the forgery may involve issues related to signature verification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
