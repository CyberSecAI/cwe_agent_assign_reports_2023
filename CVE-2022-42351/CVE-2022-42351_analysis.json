This indicates a hierarchical relationship where CWE-863 is a more specific type of improper authorization. CWE-863 represents the scenario where an authorization check is performed, but it's done incorrectly.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n    class cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863), leading to a **security feature bypass** and ultimately resulting in the **disclosure of low-level confidentiality information**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nBased on the provided information, the primary weakness is **Incorrect Authorization**, where the system performs an authorization check but does so incorrectly. This leads to a **security feature bypass** and subsequent **disclosure of low-level confidentiality information**.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states \"**Incorrect Authorization** vulnerability that could result in a security feature bypass\" and \"disclose low level confidentiality information.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the **root cause** is \"Improper Access Control,\" and the vulnerability is classified as CWE-284. However, CWE-284 is a Pillar, and the mapping guidance discourages its use due to its high-level nature. It suggests considering more specific descendants, such as CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) or CWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**).\n\nGiven that the vulnerability involves an authorization check being performed incorrectly, CWE-863 is a better fit than CWE-862, which implies a complete absence of authorization checks. The impact of this vulnerability is the disclosure of confidential information, which aligns with CWE-200 (Information Exposure).\n\nWhile the retriever results list CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) as the top result, the mapping guidance recommends against using it directly. CWE-863 is the next most relevant option from the retriever results and aligns well with the provided details.\n\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization) was considered, but it's a Class-level CWE, and its description encompasses both missing and incorrect authorization checks. Since the description specifies **incorrect authorization**, CWE-863 is more specific and appropriate.\n\nCWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) was also considered but deemed less appropriate as it focuses on misconfigured permissions for resources rather than an incorrect authorization process.\n\nUltimately, CWE-863 is the most accurate representation of the **root cause** based on the provided evidence.\nThe disclosure of information is an impact (CWE-200) secondary to the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
