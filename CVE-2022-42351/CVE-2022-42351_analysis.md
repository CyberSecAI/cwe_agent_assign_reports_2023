## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-863, which is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), which in turn is a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). This indicates a hierarchical relationship where CWE-863 is a more specific type of improper authorization. CWE-863 represents the scenario where an authorization check is performed, but it's done incorrectly.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863), leading to a **security feature bypass** and ultimately resulting in the **disclosure of low-level confidentiality information**.

## Summary of Analysis
Based on the provided information, the primary weakness is **Incorrect Authorization**, where the system performs an authorization check but does so incorrectly. This leads to a **security feature bypass** and subsequent **disclosure of low-level confidentiality information**.

The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Incorrect Authorization** vulnerability that could result in a security feature bypass" and "disclose low level confidentiality information." The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms that the **root cause** is "Improper Access Control," and the vulnerability is classified as CWE-284. However, CWE-284 is a Pillar, and the mapping guidance discourages its use due to its high-level nature. It suggests considering more specific descendants, such as CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) or CWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**).

Given that the vulnerability involves an authorization check being performed incorrectly, CWE-863 is a better fit than CWE-862, which implies a complete absence of authorization checks. The impact of this vulnerability is the disclosure of confidential information, which aligns with CWE-200 (Information Exposure).

While the retriever results list CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) as the top result, the mapping guidance recommends against using it directly. CWE-863 is the next most relevant option from the retriever results and aligns well with the provided details.

CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) was considered, but it's a Class-level CWE, and its description encompasses both missing and incorrect authorization checks. Since the description specifies **incorrect authorization**, CWE-863 is more specific and appropriate.

CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) was also considered but deemed less appropriate as it focuses on misconfigured permissions for resources rather than an incorrect authorization process.

Ultimately, CWE-863 is the most accurate representation of the **root cause** based on the provided evidence.
The disclosure of information is an impact (CWE-200) secondary to the root cause.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.



## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges 
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.



## CWE-281: Improper Preservation of Permissions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not preserve permissions or incorrectly preserves permissions when copying, restoring, or sharing objects, which can cause them to have less restrictive permissions than intended.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-424: Improper Protection of Alternate Path
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently protect all possible paths that a user can take to access restricted functionality or resources.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
