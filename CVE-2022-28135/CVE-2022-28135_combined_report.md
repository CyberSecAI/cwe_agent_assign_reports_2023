## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events starts with the **unencrypted storage of passwords** in the configuration file. This leads to the exposure of those passwords to unauthorized users who have access to the Jenkins controller file system.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis indicates that the vulnerability stems from storing passwords in plaintext in a configuration file, allowing unauthorized users to view them.

The selection is based on the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which explicitly state that the passwords are stored **unencrypted**. The **rootcause** is **unencrypted storage of sensitive information**.

*   "Jenkins instant-messaging Plugin 1.41 and earlier stores passwords for group chats **unencrypted** in the global configuration file"
*   "The instant-messaging Plugin stores passwords for group chats **unencrypted**."

The graph relationships highlight the hierarchy of CWEs, guiding the selection towards the most specific and relevant option. CWE-256 aligns perfectly with the described vulnerability, representing the **plaintext storage of a password**.

Relevant CWE Information:

*   **CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password:** This is the primary CWE because the description matches the vulnerability exactly. The vulnerability description states that passwords for group chats are stored **unencrypted**, which directly aligns with the definition of CWE-256.
*   **CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** This is a broader CWE, but still relevant. The vulnerability involves storing sensitive information (passwords) in cleartext, which aligns with CWE-312. However, CWE-256 is more specific since it focuses on passwords, making it a better fit.
*   **CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials:** This is a higher-level class of weakness that includes various ways credentials can be insecurely handled. While the vulnerability falls under this category, CWE-256 provides a more precise description of the specific issue.

CWEs Considered but Not Used:

*   **CWE-260: Password in Configuration File:** While related, this CWE is less specific than CWE-256. CWE-256 directly addresses the issue of passwords being stored in plaintext, while CWE-260 only mentions the storage location. Plaintext storage is the core issue, so CWE-256 is a better fit.
*   **CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory:** This CWE focuses on the placement of sensitive information in accessible files. While this is a component of the vulnerability, the primary weakness is the lack of encryption.
*   **CWE-862: Missing Authorization and CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization:** These CWEs relate to authorization issues, which are not the primary concern in this vulnerability. The core issue is the **unencrypted** storage of passwords, not a lack of authorization checks.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the **rootcause** of the vulnerability: the **unencrypted storage of passwords**. This is a base-level weakness that leads directly to the potential compromise of user credentials.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.

### Extended Description
Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.

- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure
**Abstraction:** Pillar
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product.

### Extended Description
This weakness covers three distinct situations. A "missing" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An "insufficient" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an "ignored" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
None

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.
**Comments:** Consider children or descendants of this entry instead.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Research Gap]** The concept of protection mechanisms is well established, but protection mechanism failures have not been studied comprehensively. It is suspected that protection mechanisms can have significantly different types of weaknesses than the weaknesses that they are intended to prevent.






## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

### Extended Description


Because the information is stored in cleartext (i.e., unencrypted), attackers could potentially read it. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.


When organizations adopt cloud services, it can be easier for attackers to access the data from anywhere on the Internet.


In some systems/environments such as cloud, the use of "double encryption" (at both the software and hardware layer) might be required, and the developer might be solely responsible for both layers, instead of shared responsibility with the administrator of the broader system/environment.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-311
ChildOf -> CWE-311
ChildOf -> CWE-922

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** Different people use "cleartext" and "plaintext" to mean the same thing: the lack of encryption. However, within cryptography, these have more precise meanings. Plaintext is the information just before it is fed into a cryptographic algorithm, including already-encrypted text. Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-readable (such as base64 encoding).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30275:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.
- **CVE-2009-2272:** password and username stored in cleartext in a cookie
- **CVE-2009-1466:** password stored in cleartext in a file with insecure permissions
