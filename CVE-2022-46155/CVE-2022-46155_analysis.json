CWE-201 is a more general case of sending sensitive data and can follow CWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer). However, in this case, the information was directly included due to a build misconfiguration rather than improper removal, making CWE-526 more appropriate as the primary cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe526[\"CWE-526: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in an Environment Variable\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n\n    cwe526 -->|CHILDOF| cwe312\n    cwe201 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe212\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe526 primary\n    class cwe201,cwe212 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves:\n1.  **Misconfigured build script** (**ROOT CAUSE**)\n2.  Accidental inclusion of the environment variable AIRTABLE_API_KEY during the build process.\n3.  Potential distribution of the built file containing the API key.\n4.  Exposure of sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **misconfigured build script** as the root cause, leading to the **inclusion of sensitive information in the build target**. The evidence from the CVE description clearly states that the `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` environment variable was being bundled into the JavaScript code due to the build script **misconfiguration**.\n\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-526 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in an Environment Variable), which directly addresses the **weakness** of storing the API key in an environment variable that was unintentionally included in the build. This aligns with the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which highlights the **credentials exposure** and **build process misconfiguration**.\n\nI considered CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) as a secondary candidate, as the API key was indeed inserted into the bundled code. However, CWE-526 is more specific in that it highlights the environment variable aspect, making it the more accurate primary classification.\n\nThe selection of CWE-526 is at the optimal level of specificity (Variant), as it precisely captures the vulnerability's root cause and mechanism.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
