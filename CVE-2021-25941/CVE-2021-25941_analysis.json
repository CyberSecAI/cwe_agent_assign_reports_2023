This hierarchical relationship indicates that CWE-1321 is a more specific case of a broader class of weaknesses related to object attribute modification. CWE-1321 can precede CWE-471 (Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1321[\"CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\"]\n    cwe915[\"CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Object Attributes\"]\n    cwe471[\"CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)\"]\n\n    cwe1321 -->|ChildOf| cwe915\n    cwe1321 -->|ChildOf| cwe913\n    cwe1321 -->|CanPrecede| cwe471\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1321 primary\n    class cwe915,cwe913,cwe471 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **prototype pollution** (**rootcause**) which leads to denial of service and potential remote code execution (**impact**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assigned CWE is CWE-1321 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')). This assignment is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions \"**prototype pollution**\", and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which identifies \"**Prototype Pollution (CWE-1321)**\" as a weakness. The summary also states, \"The `override()` function in the `deep-override` NPM module does not validate the type of object before assigning values to properties, specifically not checking if the property is part of the object itself or if it's a property of the prototype,\" which is an indicator of **improper control of object prototype attributes**.\nThe retriever results also strongly support this assignment. The high confidence score (1.0) reflects the direct match between the vulnerability description and the CWE definition.\nCWE-1321 is chosen because it is the most specific variant that accurately describes the weakness. The evidence directly supports this classification, as shown in the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**:

abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads from a buffer

of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA
