There are no explicit chain relationships indicated in the provided information.

This is based on the description mentioning an **MFA bypass** due to some unspecified weakness. The \"Retriever Results\" also lists CWE-305 with the highest score for the dense retriever, making it a strong candidate. Since the description mentions a **bypass**, the **\"Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\"** description matches.\n\nThe secondary CWE considered is CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication), which is a class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-305. The retriever results include CWE-1390 as a candidate. While the vulnerability leads to **MFA bypass**, the root cause isn't specifically identified as a weak authentication mechanism itself, but rather a separate weakness enabling the bypass.\n\nThe evidence is weak because there is no \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section to validate the root cause of the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe authentication algorithm is sound, but the implemented mechanism can be bypassed as the result of a separate weakness that is primary to the authentication error.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Most \"authentication bypass\" errors are resultant, not primary.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAttackers may be able to bypass weak authentication faster and/or with less effort than expected.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction",
