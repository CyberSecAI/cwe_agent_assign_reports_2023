Although CWE-367 is more specific, the description is too general to know if it is a Time-of-check Time-of-use condition. CWE-754 was also considered given the **improper integrity check**, but the **race condition** is a clearer and better indication of the actual vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe754[\"CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    \n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe367,cwe754 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper integrity check** leading to a **race condition** between tasks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment and the criticism both pointed towards a race condition. The final conclusion favors CWE-362 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of a **race condition** in the vulnerability description and the lack of specifics to narrow it down to a TOCTOU condition.\nThe primary evidence is:\n> **Improper integrity check** can lead to **race condition** between tasks PDCP and RRC\n\nThe graph relationships helped to evaluate the specificity of the CWEs. CWE-362 is selected as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the **race condition**, which is explicitly mentioned in the vulnerability description. While CWE-367 is a more specific type of race condition, there isn't enough evidence to confirm that it's a TOCTOU vulnerability.\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity given the available information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**:

abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations for the resulting pointer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe

0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for

abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6294.47\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6198.84\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations for the resulting pointer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry",
