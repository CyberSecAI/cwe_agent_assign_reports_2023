CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a child of CWE-285 and was considered but deemed less suitable as the description details a **bug in the security cache** rather than a simple incorrect authorization check. CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) was considered because the vulnerability leads to unauthorized access, but it is too high-level and discouraged when lower-level CWEs are applicable.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe668 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **bug in the security cache** that leads to the overwriting of rights, which results in improper authorization.\n  - **Root Cause:** Bug in the security cache.\n  - **Weakness:** Improper Authorization (CWE-285)\n  - **Impact:** Overwriting of rights for spaces and documents.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the resulting impact. The provided evidence strongly suggests that the **bug in the security cache** leads to improper authorization. The retriever results and the CVE reference links content summary both support this assessment. The selection of CWE-285 is based on the vulnerability description, which indicates that the system incorrectly handles authorization due to the cache **bug**, allowing unauthorized access and modification of content.\n\nThe vulnerability description states that \"a **bug in the security cache** stores rules associated to document Page1.Page2 and space Page1.Page2 in the same cache entry. That means that its possible to overwrite the rights of a space or a document by creating the page of the space with the same name and checking the right of the new one first so that they end up in the security cache and are used for the other too.\" This clearly indicates an authorization issue where the system **does not properly** distinguish between document and space permissions due to the cache **bug**.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision to select CWE-285 as the primary CWE, considering its parent-child relationship with CWE-863 and CWE-668. While CWE-863 is more specific, the root cause is a cache **bug** that leads to broader improper authorization, making CWE-285 a more accurate representation. CWE-668 is too general and discouraged when more specific options exist.\n\nCWE-285 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately represents the vulnerability as an authorization issue stemming from a cache **bug**, without being overly specific like CWE-863, which implies a more direct error in the authorization check itself.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
