CWE-667 is a Class-level CWE, and a child of CWE-662 (Improper Synchronization), indicating a potential synchronization issue that leads to the vulnerability. The relationship analysis shows that improper locking can lead to race conditions which in turn can lead to use-after-free vulnerabilities.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe662[\"CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe667 -->|CHILDOF| cwe662\n    cwe362 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe416\n    cwe667 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe362\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe667 secondary\n    class cwe662,cwe362,cwe825 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper locking** (CWE-667), which leads to a race condition, eventually resulting in a **use after free** (CWE-416).\n  - Initial Flaw: **Improper Locking**\n  - Resulting Weakness: Race Condition\n  - Final Impact: **Use After Free**\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause and the resulting weakness.
