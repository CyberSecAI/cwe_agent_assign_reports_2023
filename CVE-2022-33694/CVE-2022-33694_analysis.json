The hierarchical relationship indicates that CWE-927 is a more specific case of improper authorization related to Android's implicit intents. The vulnerability description clearly states the use of **unprotected intent broadcasting** for sensitive information, aligning perfectly with CWE-927. CWE-200 is a parent of CWE-213 and is too general and is better to use the child of this relationship.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe927[\"CWE-927: Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe927 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe927 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe927 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **unprotected intent broadcasting** (CWE-927), leading to the exposure of sensitive Wi-Fi information to a local attacker. The root cause is the lack of proper access control on the intent broadcast. The impact is unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference summary. The key phrase \"**unprotected intent broadcasting**\" directly points to CWE-927, as it describes the use of implicit intents for sensitive communication without proper protection. The CVE reference confirms this by stating that the application broadcasts Wi-Fi information via an intent without proper permission checks.\n\nThe selection of CWE-927 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the Android-specific issue of using implicit intents for sensitive communication. While CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) are related, they are more general and less precise than CWE-927. The evidence strongly supports CWE-927 as the primary weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA protocol or its implementation supports interaction between multiple actors and allows those actors to negotiate which algorithm should be used as a protection mechanism such as encryption or authentication, but it does not select the strongest algorithm that is available to both parties.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
