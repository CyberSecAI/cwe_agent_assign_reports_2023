CWE-400 is a **Class** level weakness and a parent of CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling), which could also be relevant. The relationship between CWE-1333 and CWE-400 is that inefficient regex complexity can lead to uncontrolled resource consumption, but CWE-1333 is more specific to the root cause in this case.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    cwe1333 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n    class cwe407 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the use of an inefficient regular expression (CWE-1333). This leads to excessive CPU consumption, which in turn causes a denial of service (DoS). In addition, long headers are kept in memory, contributing to memory exhaustion. The connection to the malicious server can be kept open, potentially leading to connection pool exhaustion.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-1333 as the primary weakness, given the **Regular Expression Denial of Service** root cause. This is further supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary section which states \"The vulnerability is a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) present in Ruby's `net/http` library when processing HTTP headers.\"\nThe retriever results also list CWE-1333 as the top match. The evidence provided clearly indicates that the **inefficient regular expression** is the root cause of the vulnerability, leading to a denial-of-service condition.\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) was also considered but determined to be a secondary effect of the primary weakness (CWE-1333).\nThe selection of CWE-1333 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the inefficient regular expression complexity that leads to excessive CPU consumption.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1176: Inefficient CPU Computation\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs CPU

Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case

is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n-

providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
