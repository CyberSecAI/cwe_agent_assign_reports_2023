The \"Retriever Results\" also lists CWE-362 as the top combined result. The vulnerability description key phrases includes **weakness: race condition**, solidifying this selection.\n\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, specifically: \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" which states \"**weakness:** **race condition**\".\n\nCWE-362 is a Class-level CWE, and the guidance suggests examining its children for a better fit. However, the description doesn't provide specific details on the type of race condition, so a more specific child CWE is not justifiable based on available information. Therefore, CWE-362 is the most appropriate choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n##
