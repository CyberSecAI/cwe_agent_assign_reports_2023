# Analysis for CVE-2022-20115

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 1.0 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE |
| CWE-223 | Omission of Security-relevant Information | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship impacting the decision is the hierarchical one. CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** is a child of CWE-285 **Improper Authorization**. The retriever results identified several authorization related CWEs, but the **missing permission check** root cause evidence strongly supports focusing on authorization. Although a more specific base CWE under CWE-862 might exist, the evidence does not provide enough detail to select it, so CWE-862 is selected. CWE-223 **Omission of Security-relevant Information** is a peer of CWE-215 **Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Debugging Code** and both are children of CWE-221 **Information Loss**.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **missing permission check** (CWE-862), leading to the ability to "learn base station information without location permission," resulting in local information disclosure.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on the **missing permission check** as the root cause. The retriever results and provided context pointed towards various authorization and information disclosure-related CWEs. The final decision hinged on the evidence from the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" and "CVE Reference Links Content Summary", specifically the phrase "**missing permission check**" which clearly indicates an authorization issue.

The selection of CWE-862 is based on the **rootcause** evidence and the mapping guidance. While CWE-862 is a Class, there isn't enough information to select a more specific Base-level CWE.

CWE-223 is considered as a secondary weakness as the vulnerability leads to information disclosure.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-20115

## Vulnerability Description
In broadcastServiceStateChanged of TelephonyRegistry.java, there is a possible way to learn base station information without location permission due to a **missing permission check**. This could lead to local information disclosure with User execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product AndroidVersions Android-12 Android-12LAndroid ID A-210118427

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **missing permission check**
- **impact:** learn base station information without location permission
- **attacker:** User with execution privileges
- **product:** Android
- **version:** Android-12 and Android-12L
- **component:** broadcastServiceStateChanged of TelephonyRegistry.java

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20115:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient permission checks when broadcasting `ServiceState` information. Specifically, the system was sending full service state information without requiring the `android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission, even though this information can contain location-related data. This allowed applications without the necessary location permission to access sensitive location data, which would usually be restricted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure (ID):** The primary vulnerability is an information disclosure. The system was improperly sharing potentially sensitive location data within the full `ServiceState` broadcast to applications lacking the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission.
*   **Missing Permission Check:** The root cause is a missing permission check before broadcasting the full `ServiceState`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Location Information:** An application without the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission could receive the full `ServiceState` broadcast, thereby gaining access to location-related data without proper authorization. This could include information about the cellular network the device is connected to, which can be used to determine the general location of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Application:** A malicious application installed on the device could exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Execution Privileges:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed and running on the device to receive the broadcast and exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

* The fix involves updating the permissions required for the `ServiceState` broadcast, ensuring that the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission is needed to get the full broadcast and avoid unauthorized access to the full service state data. The fix introduces sending a location-sanitized copy when the application lacks the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission.
*   The provided commit message indicates that the vulnerability was verified manually through an app.
*   The fix was applied across Android versions 12 and 12L.
* The vulnerability is categorized as "High" severity.

This detailed breakdown provides a clear understanding of the vulnerability, its cause, and its impact.

## CWE-927: Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The Android application uses an implicit intent for transmitting sensitive data to other applications.

### Extended Description


Since an implicit intent does not specify a particular application to receive the data, any application can process the intent by using an Intent Filter for that intent. This can allow untrusted applications to obtain sensitive data. There are two variations on the standard broadcast intent, ordered and sticky.


Ordered broadcast intents are delivered to a series of registered receivers in order of priority as declared by the Receivers. A malicious receiver can give itself a high priority and cause a denial of service by stopping the broadcast from propagating further down the chain. There is also the possibility of malicious data modification, as a receiver may also alter the data within the Intent before passing it on to the next receiver. The downstream components have no way of asserting that the data has not been altered earlier in the chain.


Sticky broadcast intents remain accessible after the initial broadcast. An old sticky intent will be broadcast again to any new receivers that register for it in the future, greatly increasing the chances of information exposure over time. Also, sticky broadcasts cannot be protected by permissions that may apply to other kinds of intents.


In addition, any broadcast intent may include a URI that references data that the receiving component does not normally have the privileges to access. The sender of the intent can include special privileges that grant the receiver read or write access to the specific URI included in the intent. A malicious receiver that intercepts this intent will also gain those privileges and be able to read or write the resource at the specified URI.

## CWE-514: Covert Channel
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
A covert channel is a path that can be used to transfer information in a way not intended by the system's designers.

### Extended Description
Typically the system has not given authorization for the transmission and has no knowledge of its occurrence.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** A covert channel can be thought of as an emergent resource, meaning that it was not an originally intended resource, however it exists due the application's behaviors.

**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.9, members of the CWE Hardware SIG are working to improve CWE's coverage of transient execution weaknesses, which include issues related to Spectre, Meltdown, and other attacks that create or exploit covert channels. As a result of that work, this entry might change in CWE 4.10.






## CWE-665: Improper Initialization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.

### Extended Description
This can have security implications when the associated resource is expected to have certain properties or values, such as a variable that determines whether a user has been authenticated or not.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships

**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-1471:** chain: an invalid value prevents a library file from being included, skipping initialization of key variables, leading to resultant eval injection.
- **CVE-2008-3637:** Improper error checking in protection mechanism produces an uninitialized variable, allowing security bypass and code execution.
- **CVE-2008-4197:** Use of uninitialized memory may allow code execution.




## CWE-925: Improper Verification of Intent by Broadcast Receiver
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The Android application uses a Broadcast Receiver that receives an Intent but does not properly verify that the Intent came from an authorized source.

### Extended Description
Certain types of Intents, identified by action string, can only be broadcast by the operating system itself, not by third-party applications. However, when an application registers to receive these implicit system intents, it is also registered to receive any explicit intents. While a malicious application cannot send an implicit system intent, it can send an explicit intent to the target application, which may assume that any received intent is a valid implicit system intent and not an explicit intent from another application. This may lead to unintended behavior.

### Alternative Terms
Intent Spoofing

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-940

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry will be made more comprehensive in later CWE versions.






## CWE-205: Observable Behavioral Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product's behaviors indicate important differences that may be observed by unauthorized actors in a way that reveals (1) its internal state or decision process, or (2) differences from other products with equivalent functionality.

### Extended Description
Ideally, a product should provide as little information about its internal operations as possible. Otherwise, attackers could use knowledge of these internal operations to simplify or optimize their attack. In some cases, behavioral discrepancies can be used by attackers to form a side channel.

### Alternative Terms
None

- **CVE-2002-0208:** Product modifies TCP/IP stack and ICMP error messages in unusual ways that show the product is in use.
- **CVE-2004-2252:** Behavioral infoleak by responding to SYN-FIN packets.




## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.

### Extended Description


Attackers at the destination may be able to spoof trusted servers to steal data or cause a denial of service.


There are at least two distinct weaknesses that can cause the product to communicate with an unintended destination:


  - If the product allows an attacker to control which destination is specified, then the attacker can cause it to connect to an untrusted or malicious destination. For example, because UDP is a connectionless protocol, UDP packets can be spoofed by specifying a false source address in the packet; when the server receives the packet and sends a reply, it will specify a destination by using the source of the incoming packet - i.e., the false source. The server can then be tricked into sending traffic to the wrong host, which is effective for hiding the real source of an attack and for conducting a distributed denial of service (DDoS). As another example, server-side request forgery (SSRF) and XML External Entity (XXE) can be used to trick a server into making outgoing requests to hosts that cannot be directly accessed by the attacker due to firewall restrictions.

  - If the product incorrectly specifies the destination, then an attacker who can control this destination might be able to spoof trusted servers. While the most common occurrence is likely due to misconfiguration by an administrator, this can be resultant from other weaknesses. For example, the product might incorrectly parse an e-mail or IP address and send sensitive data to an unintended destination. As another example, an Android application may use a "sticky broadcast" to communicate with a receiver for a particular application, but since sticky broadcasts can be processed by *any* receiver, this can allow a malicious application to access restricted data that was only intended for a different application.
