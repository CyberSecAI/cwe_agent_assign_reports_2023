CWE-319 is a more specific case of CWE-311, where sensitive data is transmitted without encryption. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the keystrokes are transmitted via **plaintext radio transmissions**, making CWE-319 the more appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    \n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe311 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of encryption** of keystrokes during radio transmission. This leads to the **transmission of sensitive information in cleartext**, which allows attackers to **sniff and inject keystrokes**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description clearly states that the keystrokes are transmitted via **plaintext radio transmissions**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further supports this by stating **Lack of proper encryption**.\nBased on the evidence, the most accurate CWE is CWE-319, which describes the specific case of transmitting sensitive information in cleartext. While CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) could also apply, it is a more general classification. CWE-319 is a child of CWE-311 making it the more specific and appropriate choice.\nThe selection of CWE-319 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **plaintext radio transmissions**, which is the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not about limiting interaction frequency.*\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability doesn't involve resource consumption or amplification.*\n\n## CWE-406: Insufficient Control of Network Message Volume (Network Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently monitor or control transmitted network traffic volume, so that an actor can cause the product to transmit more traffic than should be allowed for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not about network traffic volume.*\n\n## CWE-300: Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not adequately verify the identity of actors at both ends of a communication channel, or does not adequately ensure the integrity of the channel, in a way that allows the channel to be accessed or influenced by an actor that is not an endpoint.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-300 is commonly misused for vulnerabilities in which the prerequisites for exploitation require the adversary to be in a privileged \"in-the-middle\" position.\n\n*This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is about lack of encryption, not about channel access control.*\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability doesn't involve weak credentials.*\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
