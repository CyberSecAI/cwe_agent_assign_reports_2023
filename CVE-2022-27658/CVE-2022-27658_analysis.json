Its parent is CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), indicating a broader category of authorization issues. The relationship suggests that if a more specific authorization flaw can be identified, a child of CWE-862 or CWE-285 might be more appropriate. CWE-200, a Class-level weakness related to information exposure, is considered as a secondary concern due to the potential impact of the **missing authorization**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check (CWE-862). This leads to unauthorized access to information. This unauthorized access can then lead to the exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" clearly states that the vulnerability is due to a **missing authorization** check in the SAP Innovation Management component. The provided information explicitly mentions that the system \"fails to properly verify if a user has the necessary permissions to perform a specific action.\" This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), which describes a scenario where the product \"does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\"\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-862, further supporting this classification. While CWE-862 is a Class-level CWE and the guidance suggests looking for more specific Base-level CWEs, the available information does not provide enough detail to pinpoint a more granular weakness. Therefore, CWE-862 is the most appropriate choice based on the provided evidence.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was considered as a secondary CWE because the **missing authorization** directly leads to unauthorized information access. However, it's crucial to recognize that CWE-200 represents the impact of the vulnerability, not the root cause. The root cause is the **lack of authorization** check that allows the unauthorized access to occur in the first place.\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence from the vulnerability description, particularly the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" which explicitly identifies the **missing authorization** check as the root cause. The selection of CWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity given the available information, representing the core flaw that enables the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
