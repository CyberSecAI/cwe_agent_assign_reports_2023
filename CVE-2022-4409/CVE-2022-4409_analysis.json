CWE-614 is a variant of CWE-319, providing a more specific classification for the vulnerability involving sensitive cookies transmitted over HTTPS without the \"Secure\" attribute. Choosing the variant CWE-614 allows for a more precise representation of the weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe614[\"CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe614 -->|CHILDOF| cwe319\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe614 primary\n    class cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain consists of the **root cause** where the \"Secure\" attribute is not set for a sensitive cookie in an HTTPS session. The weakness leads to the potential transmission of the cookie in cleartext, which could be intercepted by unauthorized actors.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment and the final conclusion are based on the provided evidence, which explicitly states: \"**rootcause:** **sensitive cookie in HTTPS session without secure attribute**\". The CWE selection is highly influenced by this clear statement.\n\nThe Retriever Results also supports this with CWE-614 being listed as the top combined result, with a high density score.\n\nThe relationship analysis, particularly the ChildOf relationship between CWE-614 and CWE-319, further justifies the selection of the more specific CWE-614.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability as described in the vulnerability description and key phrases.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25
