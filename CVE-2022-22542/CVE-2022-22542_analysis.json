CWE-359 and CWE-863 are related to CWE-200 as potential causes or more specific types of information exposure. CWE-359 is a child of CWE-200, representing a specific type of sensitive information (private personal information). CWE-863 can lead to CWE-200 if authorization is not handled correctly, resulting in unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe863 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe359,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Incorrect authorization** (potentially, but not definitively stated).\n2.  **Weakness:** Sensitive information (private addresses and bank details) is accessible due to the **lack of** proper authorization checks.\n3.  **Impact:** Exposure of private personal information to unauthorized actors, leading to a compromise of confidentiality.\n\nCWE-863 could be the root cause, but the description does not definitively state that authorization is missing or incorrect, only that the information is exposed.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause and the type of information exposed.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions the exposure of private addresses and bank details of Employee Business Partners to unauthorized actors. The description states, \"S/4HANA Supplier Factsheet exposes the private address and bank details... and Enterprise Search... exposes the private address fields... to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information, which could compromise Confidentiality.\"\n\nBased on the evidence, the primary weakness is CWE-200, \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor,\" because the vulnerability description explicitly states the exposure of sensitive information. However, CWE-200 is a class-level CWE and is discouraged. Therefore, a more specific CWE is needed.\n\nCWE-359, \"Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor,\" is a child of CWE-200 and is more specific. It better reflects the type of information exposed in this vulnerability, which includes private addresses and bank details.\n\nCWE-863, \"Incorrect Authorization,\" could be a contributing factor or root cause, as the description mentions that the actors are \"not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\" However, there is not enough information to definitively state that the authorization mechanism is broken or missing. It could be a configuration issue or a design flaw that leads to the exposure.\n\nThe final decision is to map the vulnerability to CWE-200 as the primary CWE since the vulnerability is described as an exposure of information. In addition, map the vulnerability to CWE-359 as it is a child of CWE-200 and focuses on privacy. Finally, map the vulnerability to CWE-863 as a possible root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
