CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) was also considered due to the storing of credentials in the SBOM, which could be considered a log file. CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) was considered but rejected as the credentials were not hard-coded but rather improperly stored. The base level abstraction was preferred due to the direct nature of the weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe532,cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper storage of credentials**, leading to the inclusion of those credentials in the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). This results in exposure of sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **improper storage of credentials**. The vulnerability description key phrases included \"**improperly stored credentials**\" as the root cause. The Retriever Results listed CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) as the top combined result.\n\nThe selection of CWE-256 is based on the fact that the credentials were **improperly stored**, which directly aligns with the description of storing a password in plaintext. While the SBOM is not strictly a log file, the inclusion of sensitive data in it makes CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) a relevant secondary consideration. CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) was considered but ultimately rejected because the issue wasn't about hard-coded credentials; it was about the credentials being **improperly stored** in the SBOM.\n\nThe evidence provided in the vulnerability description directly supports the selection of CWE-256, as it clearly states the credentials were **improperly stored**. The confidence in this assessment is high (0.9).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users. In fact, it should be noted that recoverable encrypted passwords provide no significant benefit over plaintext passwords since they are subject not only to reuse by malicious attackers but also by malicious insiders.
