CWE-319 is a child of CWE-311 and represents a more specific scenario of transmitting sensitive information without encryption. Therefore, they have a parent-child relationship. Selecting CWE-311 as the primary weakness allows for a broader characterization of the issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe311 primary\n    class cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing data encryption** (CWE-311), which directly leads to a potential information disclosure vulnerability. If the data is transmitted in cleartext (CWE-319), this increases the likelihood and impact of the information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nBased on the provided evidence, the primary weakness is **missing data encryption**, which is best represented by CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data). The vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary both highlight the **missing data encryption** as the root cause. The impact is information disclosure. CWE-311 captures the core issue of failing to protect sensitive data through encryption. The retriever results also list CWE-311 as a relevant candidate with a high score.\n\nCWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is a related CWE and could be considered a secondary weakness if the **missing data encryption** leads to cleartext transmission. It is more specific than CWE-311.\n\nThe selection of CWE-311 is primarily based on the vulnerability description key phrases and the CVE reference links content summary, which emphasize the **missing data encryption**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
