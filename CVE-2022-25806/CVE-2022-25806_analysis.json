CWE-798 is a child of CWE-1391 (Use of Weak Credentials). CWE-1240 (Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation) is related because using a hardcoded key is a risky implementation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n    cwe1240[\"CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\"]\n\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1391\n    cwe321 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe1240\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe321 primary\n    class cwe798,cwe1240,cwe1391 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **hardcoded DES key**, leading to the ability to **decrypt superuser credentials**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **hardcoded DES key**. This allows attackers to decrypt credentials.\n\n*   **CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key** is the most specific and appropriate CWE. The vulnerability description clearly states a \"**hardcoded DES key**\" is the root cause. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also confirms this: \"Hardcoded DES key in LDAPDesPWEncrypter: The IGEL Universal Management Suite (UMS) uses a hardcoded DES key in the `LDAPDesPWEncrypter` class for encrypting/decrypting LDAP bind credentials.\" CWE-321 is a Variant-level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The Mapping Guidance allows its use.\n*   **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials** is a broader category, but still relevant. While the specific issue is a cryptographic key, CWE-798 encompasses any hardcoded credential. This is a Base level CWE, and its use is allowed per the mapping guidance.\n*   **CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation** is also relevant because DES is a weak encryption algorithm. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" says \"Insecure Encryption: The use of DES is considered weak encryption.\" Its usage is allowed and is a Base level.\n*   CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password was considered but not used, because it is for passwords and not cryptographic keys.\n*   CWE-1394: Use of Default Cryptographic Key was not selected because it involves default keys and not hardcoded keys.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
