CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) is a child of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials), providing a more specific classification. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a parent of CWE-213 (Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies). These parent-child relationships helped refine the selection towards the most accurate and specific CWE. The relationship between CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) was also considered, but the evidence pointed more towards credential storage than authorization failure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe213[\"CWE-213: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe213 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe522,cwe200,cwe213,cwe732,cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **plaintext storage of credentials** (CWE-256) which leads to unauthorized access to a configuration file, and subsequently, access to other system files for which the attacker is not authorized.\n  - Root Cause: CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\n  - Impact: Access to sensitive configuration file with credentials\n  - Impact: Unauthorized access to other system files\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified several candidate CWEs including CWE-256, CWE-200, and CWE-732. The description explicitly mentions access to a configuration file containing credentials, which strongly suggests **plaintext storage of a password**. The statement \"access a file containing sensitive data which can be used to access a configuration file which contains credentials to access other system files\" is the key evidence supporting this. While CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a broader category, the specific mention of stored credentials makes CWE-256 a more precise fit. Although CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) was considered, the primary issue isn't the assignment of incorrect permissions, but rather the **insecure storage of the credentials themselves**. The final decision favors CWE-256 as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: **the insecure storage of credentials in plaintext**. This is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability based on the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
