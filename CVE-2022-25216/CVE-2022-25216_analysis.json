CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) can precede CWE-36, indicating a potential chain where external control of a file path leads to absolute path traversal. The abstraction levels are all Base, indicating a suitable level of specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe36[\"CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    \n    cwe36 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe36\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe36 primary\n    class cwe22,cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with external control over the file path (CWE-73), leading to the use of an absolute path to access unauthorized files (CWE-36). This allows a remote attacker to download any file on the Windows file system (impact).\n  - Root Cause: External Control of File Name or Path (CWE-73)\n  - Weakness: Absolute Path Traversal (CWE-36)\n  - Impact: Arbitrary File Read\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, several CWEs related to path traversal were considered, including CWE-22, CWE-23, and CWE-73. However, the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**absolute path traversal**,\" making CWE-36 the most appropriate primary classification.\n\nThe \"**weakness:** **absolute path traversal**\" phrase from the Vulnerability Description Key Phrases directly supports this choice. Further evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the application \"does not properly sanitize or validate the file path provided by the user,\" allowing an attacker to \"specify any path on the system.\"\n\nCWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) is considered a secondary CWE because the attacker can manipulate the file path. CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')) is also considered as it is the parent of CWE-36.\n\nThe final decision is based on the specific mention of \"**absolute path traversal**\" and the ability to read arbitrary files due to **improper** validation of the file path. Therefore, CWE-36 is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
