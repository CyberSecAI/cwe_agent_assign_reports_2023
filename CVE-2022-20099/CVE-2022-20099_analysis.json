The vulnerability description and the CVE reference both explicitly mention this weakness. CWE-787 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred.\n\nCWE-20 (**Improper Input Validation**) is included as a secondary CWE because the **root cause** of the vulnerability is **improper input validation**, which leads to the **out-of-bounds write**. Although CWE-20 is a Class level CWE and is generally discouraged for direct mapping, it is included here to capture the root cause.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-131 (**Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size**): While related to buffer overflows, this CWE is not the primary issue. The core problem is lack of validation, not calculation errors.\n*   CWE-908 (**Use of Uninitialized Resource**): This CWE doesn't fit the vulnerability description because it focuses on uninitialized resources, while the vulnerability is related to **improper input validation** leading to **out-of-bounds write**.\n*   CWE-667 (**Improper Locking**) and CWE-362 (**Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')**): These CWEs are related to concurrency issues and are not directly relevant to the described vulnerability, which focuses on **improper input validation** and its consequence, the **out-of-bounds write**.\n*   CWE-120 (**Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')**): This CWE is similar to CWE-787, but CWE-787 is more specific.\n*   CWE-190 (**Integer Overflow or Wraparound**) and CWE-191 (**Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)**): These CWEs are not directly applicable as the vulnerability description doesn't mention integer overflow or underflow issues.\n*   CWE-862 (**Missing Authorization**): This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability isn't about missing authorization checks but about **improper input validation**.",
