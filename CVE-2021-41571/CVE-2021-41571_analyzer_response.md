# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, which is a Class-level CWE. CWE-639, Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key, is a Base-level CWE and a ChildOf CWE-863. The vulnerability involves **improper authorization** because the system **does not properly validate that the ledger ID is valid** within the context of the topic. This allows users to potentially access data from ledgers they are not authorized to access, which is a form of **authorization bypass through a user-controlled key** (the ledger ID).

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events for this vulnerability is as follows:
1.  **Root Cause:** **Not proper validation that ledger ID is valid** in the context of the topic.
2.  The Admin API `get-message-by-id` uses the ledger ID provided by the user.
3.  **Weakness:** The system fails to verify if the ledger ID belongs to the topic specified in the command.
4.  **Impact:** Users can access data from BookKeeper that does not belong to the topics accessible by the authenticated user, leading to potential data leakage.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified CWE-863 as the primary candidate due to the **incorrect authorization** in the `get-message-by-id` API, which allows access to unauthorized data. The retriever results and vulnerability description key phrases support this selection. The vulnerability description key phrase "**not proper validation that ledger id is valid**" from the vulnerability description directly points to an authorization issue.

The evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary strengthens this selection. It explicitly states that the `get-message-by-id` admin command did not properly validate the topic associated with the message ID being requested.

CWE-639, Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key, is a more specific CWE that applies as a secondary weakness, because the ledger ID acts as the user-controlled key that bypasses authorization checks. However, since the core issue is an **incorrect authorization** check and not solely the user-controlled key, CWE-863 is the primary CWE.

The final CWE selection is at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-863 capturing the general **incorrect authorization** and CWE-639 highlighting the specific mechanism of **authorization bypass through a user-controlled key**.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-285
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction

### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

### Extended Description
Retrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.

For example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.

One manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.

### Alternative Terms
Insecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The "Insecure Direct Object Reference" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.
Broken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.
Horizontal Authorization: "Horizontal Authorization" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-36539:** An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.
