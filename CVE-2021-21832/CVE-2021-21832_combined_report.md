# Analysis for CVE-2021-21832

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-787, which directly reflects the **out-of-bounds write**. CWE-190 is included as a secondary weakness because the vulnerability description and CVE reference explicitly state that an **integer overflow** leads to the allocation of a small buffer, which subsequently results in the **out-of-bounds write**.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the parsing of a crafted ISO file. This leads to an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) when calculating the buffer size. The **integer overflow** results in allocating a small buffer. Subsequent writes to this small buffer cause a heap **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787), which leads to memory corruption and a potential crash.

## Summary of Analysis
Initially, the description indicated a memory corruption vulnerability leading to an out-of-bounds write. The provided evidence, particularly the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, strongly supports CWE-787 (**Out-of-bounds Write**). The summary explicitly states that "subsequent writes to this small buffer will cause a heap out-of-bounds write." This direct statement reinforces the selection of CWE-787 as the primary weakness.

Furthermore, the CVE Reference Links Content Summary states, "An **integer overflow** occurs when parsing a crafted ISO file... Because the shift operation is done in a 32-bit register, an overflow can occur, causing a small or zero-size buffer to be allocated." This statement provides sufficient evidence for including CWE-190 (**Integer Overflow or Wraparound**) as a secondary contributing factor.

The relationship graph shows how these CWEs are related, with CWE-190 potentially preceding CWE-787, and both being children of the more general CWE-119. The selection of CWE-787 and CWE-190 provides a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability than using the more general CWE-119 (**Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**).

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why it was not selected**: This CWE was not selected because there is no evidence of null pointer dereference. The vulnerability is due to an integer overflow leading to an out-of-bounds write.

## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why it was not selected**: This CWE was not selected because the vulnerability description and CVE reference link content summary explicitly mentioned integer overflow and not underflow.

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why it was not selected**: While the integer overflow leads to an incorrect calculation of the buffer size, CWE-190 is a better fit because it highlights the root cause, which is the integer overflow itself. The incorrect buffer size calculation is a consequence of the overflow.

## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why it was not selected**: There is no evidence in the provided information to suggest the access of an uninitialized pointer. The vulnerability stems from writing to a memory location outside the intended buffer due to an integer overflow.

## CWE-170: Improper Null Termination
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not terminate or incorrectly terminates a string or array with a null character or equivalent terminator.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why it was not selected**: This CWE does not apply, as the issue is not related to improper null termination of strings. The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write due to an integer overflow.

## CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product obtains a value from an untrusted source, converts this value to a pointer, and dereferences the resulting pointer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why it was not selected**: This CWE does not apply because the vulnerability doesn't involve dereferencing a pointer obtained from an untrusted source. It involves writing to memory outside buffer bounds.

## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why it was not selected**: While out-of-bounds access is involved, the specific vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write, not a read.

## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why it was not selected**: This CWE is related, but the integer overflow causing the incorrect length value is a more fundamental issue, which is captured by CWE-190. The out-of-bounds write is the direct result of this, making CWE-787 the better fit.

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-21832

## Vulnerability Description
**A memory corruption vulnerability** exists in the ISO Parsing functionality of Disc Soft Ltd Deamon Tools Pro 8.3.0.0767. A specially crafted malformed file can lead to an out-of-bounds write. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **A memory corruption vulnerability**
- **vector:** malformed file
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Disc Soft Ltd Deamon Tools Pro
- **version:** 8.3.0.0767
- **component:** ISO Parsing functionality

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An integer overflow occurs when parsing a crafted ISO file. The size of a directory record is read from the ISO, shifted left by 4 bits, and used as the size for a `malloc` call. Because the shift operation is done in a 32-bit register, an overflow can occur, causing a small or zero-size buffer to be allocated. Subsequent writes to this small buffer will cause a heap out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer overflow leading to heap out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Memory corruption, leading to a crash. The report doesn't specify if arbitrary code execution is possible, but an attacker could potentially achieve it by further exploiting the memory corruption.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted ISO file needs to be provided to the vulnerable software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to provide a malicious ISO file to the vulnerable application. No special position is required, and no user interaction is needed other than opening the crafted file with the vulnerable software.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1017:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to write 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2021-21220:** Chain: insufficient input validation (CWE-20) in browser allows heap corruption (CWE-787), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-28664:** GPU kernel driver allows memory corruption because a user can obtain read/write access to read-only pages, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Overflow: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
Wraparound: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-20
CanPrecede -> CWE-119

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with "overflow," "underflow," and "wraparound" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called "underflows").


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.

**[Terminology]** 

"Integer overflow" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.


A "wraparound" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.


"Overflow" is sometimes conflated with "wraparound" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.


The "overflow" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use "overflow" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using "underflow" for exceeding the minimum.


Some people use "overflow" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses "underflow" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.


See [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.


**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.




## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
out-of-bounds array index
index-out-of-range
array index underflow

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1285
ChildOf -> CWE-20
CanPrecede -> CWE-119
CanPrecede -> CWE-823
CanPrecede -> CWE-789

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness can precede uncontrolled memory allocation (CWE-789) in languages that automatically expand an array when an index is used that is larger than the size of the array, such as JavaScript.

**[Theoretical]** An improperly validated array index might lead directly to the always-incorrect behavior of "access of array using out-of-bounds index."



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-0369:** large ID in packet used as array index
- **CVE-2001-1009:** negative array index as argument to POP LIST command
- **CVE-2003-0721:** Integer signedness error leads to negative array index




## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

### Extended Description

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1018:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to read 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2020-11899:** Out-of-bounds read in IP stack used in embedded systems, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.




## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-788
ChildOf -> CWE-787

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Heap-based buffer overflows are usually just as dangerous as stack-based buffer overflows.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268:** Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).




## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-118
ChildOf -> CWE-20

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist




## CWE-128: Wrap-around Error
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Wrap around errors occur whenever a value is incremented past the maximum value for its type and therefore "wraps around" to a very small, negative, or undefined value.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-682
CanPrecede -> CWE-119
PeerOf -> CWE-190

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** The relationship between overflow and wrap-around needs to be examined more closely, since several entries (including CWE-190) are closely related.






## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-682
CanPrecede -> CWE-119

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** 

This is a broad category. Some examples include:


  - simple math errors,

  - incorrectly updating parallel counters,

  - not accounting for size differences when "transforming" one input to another format (e.g. URL canonicalization or other transformation that can generate a result that's larger than the original input, i.e. "expansion").

This level of detail is rarely available in public reports, so it is difficult to find good examples.

**[Maintenance]** 

This weakness may be a composite or a chain. It also may contain layering or perspective differences.


This issue may be associated with many different types of incorrect calculations (CWE-682), although the integer overflow (CWE-190) is probably the most prevalent. This can be primary to resource consumption problems (CWE-400), including uncontrolled memory allocation (CWE-789). However, its relationship with out-of-bounds buffer access (CWE-119) must also be considered.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-17087:** Chain: integer truncation (CWE-197) causes small buffer allocation (CWE-131) leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) in kernel pool, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2004-1363:** substitution overflow: buffer overflow using environment variables that are expanded after the length check is performed
- **CVE-2004-0747:** substitution overflow: buffer overflow using expansion of environment variables




## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.

- **CVE-2008-1440:** lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop
- **CVE-2008-2374:** lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read




## CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL.

### Extended Description
