While it's generally discouraged to map to Class-level CWEs, in this case, the description explicitly states the **exposure of sensitive information** as the core issue. The secondary CWE, CWE-782, is a Variant-level weakness and is related to **insufficient access control** on IOCTLs, which could be a contributing factor.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe782[\"CWE-782: Exposed IOCTL with Insufficient Access Control\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe749[\"CWE-749: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\"]\n\n    cwe200 -->|ChildOf| cwe668\n    cwe782 -->|ChildOf| cwe749\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe782 secondary\n    class cwe668,cwe749 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **exposed IOCTL** with **insufficient access control** (CWE-782), leading to the **exposure of sensitive information** to an unauthorized actor (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability description points towards **exposure of sensitive information** due to an unprivileged user gaining access. The key phrase \"exposure of sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information\" directly corresponds to CWE-200. However, the involvement of `DxgkDdiEscape` and the kernel mode layer suggests a lower-level issue related to IOCTL handling.\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this by highlighting the root cause as a flaw in the kernel mode layer (`nvlddmkm.sys`) handler for `DxgkDdiEscape` that allows an unprivileged user to cause the **exposure of sensitive information**.\n\nThe Retriever Results also list CWE-200 as the top result with the highest score. However, given the context of `DxgkDdiEscape` and the kernel mode layer, CWE-782, \"Exposed IOCTL with Insufficient Access Control,\" is also considered as a secondary factor that allows **exposure of sensitive information**.\n\nCWE-200 is a Class-level CWE and is generally discouraged from being mapped to, but given the explicit mention of **exposure of sensitive information** in the description, it is selected as the primary CWE. The mapping guidance for CWE-200 states \"CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.\"\n\nCWE-782 is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, given the available information. CWE-200 captures the high-level impact, while CWE-782 provides insight into the underlying technical weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
