The vulnerability description clearly states that there is a **buffer overflow** on the heap. Thus **CWE-122** **Heap-based Buffer Overflow** which is a **Variant** of **CWE-787** should also be considered. **CWE-787** is a child of **CWE-119** **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**, which is a more general **Class** level CWE. The relationship is hierarchical with **CWE-119** being the parent and **CWE-787** the child, and **CWE-122** being a more specific child of **CWE-787**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe122 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **buffer overflow** in ANGLE, which leads to heap corruption. This allows a remote attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code via a crafted HTML page.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **CWE-787** as the primary candidate based on the vulnerability description mentioning a **\"heap buffer overflow\"**. The **CWE for similar CVE Descriptions** also indicates **CWE-787** as the primary match. The retriever results list **CWE-119**, **CWE-190**, **CWE-120**, **CWE-416**, **CWE-122** as possible candidates.\n\nThe description states: \"Heap **buffer overflow** in ANGLE in Google Chrome prior to 98.0.4758.80 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the **root_cause** as \"Heap **buffer overflow** in ANGLE\" and one of the **weaknesses** as \"Heap **buffer overflow**\".\n\n**CWE-787** **Out-of-bounds Write** is the most accurate **Base** level CWE. **CWE-122** **Heap-based Buffer Overflow** which is a **Variant** of **CWE-787** is also a good fit since the **buffer overflow** occurs on the heap. **CWE-119** **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer** is a more general **Class** level CWE and is discouraged.\n\nThe final selection includes **CWE-787** as the primary CWE, with **CWE-122** as a secondary candidate because it specifies the location of the **buffer overflow**. **CWE-119** was considered but not selected as primary due to its higher level of abstraction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n*Not selected* because the vulnerability is a **buffer overflow** not a **buffer underflow**.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n*Not selected* because there is no evidence of an integer underflow.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n*Not selected* because the vulnerability description does not provide enough information to determine if the root cause is an incorrect calculation of **buffer** size.\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n*Not selected* because the vulnerability description does not provide enough information to determine if the root cause is an off-by-one error.\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n*Not selected* because the vulnerability description does not provide enough information to determine if the root cause is **buffer** access with an incorrect length value.\n\n## CWE-786: Access of Memory Location Before Start of Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available. It also overlaps existing CWE entries and might be deprecated in the future.\n*Not selected* because the vulnerability is a **buffer overflow**, not an access before the start of the **buffer**.\n\n## CWE-127: Buffer Under-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations prior to the targeted buffer.\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n*Not selected* because the vulnerability is a **buffer overflow**, not a **buffer under-read**.\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n*Not selected* because there is no evidence of a numeric truncation error.\n\n## CWE-36",
