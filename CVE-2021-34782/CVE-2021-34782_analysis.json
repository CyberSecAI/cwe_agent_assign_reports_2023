The relationship analysis indicates that while CWE-284 and CWE-285 are too general, CWE-863 provides a more specific classification because the product performs an authorization check, but does so incorrectly. CWE-200 is also a child of CWE-668, which is a sibling of CWE-284, further indicating the interconnectedness of access control, resource exposure, and information disclosure issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe668 --o cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe284,cwe285,cwe668 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access controls on API endpoints** (CWE-863), leading to a situation where an authenticated attacker can send specific API requests to obtain sensitive information (CWE-200) about other users with higher privileges. The root cause is the incorrect authorization check (CWE-863), which directly results in the exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability and mapping it to the most appropriate CWE. The vulnerability description clearly states that the issue is due to **improper access controls on API endpoints**, which aligns with CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). The vulnerability allows an attacker to gain access to sensitive information, which is a direct consequence of the authorization failure.\n\nThe retriever results also support this assessment, with CWE-863 being a strong candidate. While CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) were considered, they are too high-level. CWE-863 is more specific because it highlights that an authorization check is performed but done incorrectly. The selection of CWE-863 is further supported by the MITRE mapping guidance, which suggests examining the children of CWE-285 to find a better fit.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was considered as a secondary weakness, as it is the direct impact of the **improper authorization**. However, it's important to focus on the root cause (CWE-863) rather than the impact.\n\nThe final decision to prioritize CWE-863 is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the supporting retriever results, along with careful consideration of the CWE relationships and mapping guidance. CWE-863 is at the optimal level of specificity, accurately representing the **improper access controls on API endpoints**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level",
