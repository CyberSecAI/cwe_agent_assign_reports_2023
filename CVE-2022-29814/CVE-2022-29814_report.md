## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-94, which is a base-level CWE. CWE-94 is related to CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) via a ChildOf relationship. There is also a parent relationship to CWE-1336, Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine. CWE-79 is a base-level CWE, and child of CWE-74.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the IntelliJ IDEA improperly handling HTML descriptions in custom JSON schemas, which leads to the **improper control of code generation** and results in local code execution. The improper handling of HTML descriptions can also be viewed as **improper neutralization of input**, leading to possible cross-site scripting when the descriptions are rendered.
  - **Root Cause:** Improper handling of HTML descriptions in custom JSON schemas
  - **Weakness:** CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')
  - **Impact:** Local code execution
  - **Secondary Weakness:** CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description indicates that JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA before 2022.1 allowed local code execution via HTML descriptions in custom JSON schemas.

The initial assessment identified CWE-94 as the primary candidate due to the possibility of **improper control of code generation**, leading to code execution. The vulnerability description mentions "local code execution," which aligns with the potential impact of CWE-94.

The secondary candidate is CWE-79 because HTML descriptions could be interpreted as a form of input that is **not properly neutralized**, leading to cross-site scripting when the descriptions are rendered.

The final conclusion is to assign CWE-94 as the primary CWE because the vulnerability allows local code execution. CWE-79 is assigned as a secondary CWE because the HTML descriptions are not properly neutralized which is a form of cross-site scripting.

The selection of CWE-94 is supported by the vulnerability description mentioning "local code execution", aligning with the potential impact of the weakness. The selection of CWE-79 is supported by the vulnerability description mentioning "HTML descriptions in custom JSON schemas" which aligns with the potential impact of not neutralizing input.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as CWE-94 is a Base-level CWE, which is preferred. CWE-79 is also a Base-level CWE, making it a suitable choice for a secondary weakness.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component that specifies attributes that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control modifications of attributes of the object prototype.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component that specifies multiple attributes, properties, or fields that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control which attributes can be modified.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.

## CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.

## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input
