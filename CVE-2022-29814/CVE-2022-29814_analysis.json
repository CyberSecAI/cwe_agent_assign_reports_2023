CWE-94 is related to CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) via a ChildOf relationship. There is also a parent relationship to CWE-1336, Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine. CWE-79 is a base-level CWE, and child of CWE-74.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the IntelliJ IDEA improperly handling HTML descriptions in custom JSON schemas, which leads to the **improper control of code generation** and results in local code execution. The improper handling of HTML descriptions can also be viewed as **improper neutralization of input**, leading to possible cross-site scripting when the descriptions are rendered.\n  - **Root Cause:** Improper handling of HTML descriptions in custom JSON schemas\n  - **Weakness:** CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\n  - **Impact:** Local code execution\n  - **Secondary Weakness:** CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates that JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA before 2022.1 allowed local code execution via HTML descriptions in custom JSON schemas.\n\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-94 as the primary candidate due to the possibility of **improper control of code generation**, leading to code execution. The vulnerability description mentions \"local code execution,\" which aligns with the potential impact of CWE-94.\n\nThe secondary candidate is CWE-79 because HTML descriptions could be interpreted as a form of input that is **not properly neutralized**, leading to cross-site scripting when the descriptions are rendered.\n\nThe final conclusion is to assign CWE-94 as the primary CWE because the vulnerability allows local code execution. CWE-79 is assigned as a secondary CWE because the HTML descriptions are not properly neutralized which is a form of cross-site scripting.\n\nThe selection of CWE-94 is supported by the vulnerability description mentioning \"local code execution\", aligning with the potential impact of the weakness. The selection of CWE-79 is supported by the vulnerability description mentioning \"HTML descriptions in custom JSON schemas\" which aligns with the potential impact of not neutralizing input.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as CWE-94 is a Base-level CWE, which is preferred. CWE-79 is also a Base-level CWE, making it a suitable choice for a secondary weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component that specifies attributes that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control modifications of attributes of the object prototype.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component that specifies multiple attributes, properties, or fields that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control which attributes can be modified.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
