It is a child of CWE-22 **Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**. CWE-73 **External Control of File Name or Path** can precede CWE-23, but there is no evidence in the description. CWE-269 **Improper Privilege Management** is a Class level weakness and is the parent of many privilege related weaknesses.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe23[\"CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    \n    cwe23 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    cwe23 -->|IMPACT| cwe269\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe23 primary\n    class cwe22,cwe269 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **relative path traversal vulnerability** [CWE-23] which allows an attacker to **escalate privileges** to super admin.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-23 as the primary weakness, which aligns with the vulnerability description stating \"A **relative path traversal vulnerability** [CWE-23]\". The privileged escalation mentioned in the vulnerability is a result of the path traversal, and that is why it is not the primary weakness. The Retriever Results list CWE-22 as the top combined result, but the description clearly states **relative path traversal** which is best represented by CWE-23.\n\nThe selection of CWE-23 is at the optimal level of specificity because the description explicitly mentions \"relative path traversal\".\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 8618.00\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-269 is commonly misused. It can be conflated with \"privilege escalation,\" which is a technical impact that is listed in many low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis.\n**Comments:** If an error or mistake allows privilege escalation, then use the CWE ID for that mistake. Avoid using CWE-269 when only phrases such as \"privilege escalation\" or \"gain privileges\" are available, as these indicate technical impact of the vulnerability - not the root cause weakness. If the root cause seems to be directly related to privileges, then examine the children of CWE-269 for additional hints, such as Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250) or Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266).",
