CWE-121 is a variant of these, offering a more specific classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe788[\"CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After Start of Buffer\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe674[\"CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\"]\n\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe788\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe674 -->|CHILDOF| cwe834\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe674 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a maliciously crafted POST body leading to a **stack overflow**, ultimately causing the server to crash. The root cause is the lack of proper input validation or size checking when handling the POST body, leading to the **stack overflow** when processing it.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment points to a **stack overflow** vulnerability, directly aligning with CWE-121. The vulnerability description explicitly states a **\"stack overflow\"** bug. The retriever results also list CWE-121 as the top candidate with a score of 1.0. The analysis is based on the explicit mention of \"stack overflow\" in the vulnerability description.\n\n\"A call **stack overflow** bug in the SAML login feature in Mattermost server in versions up to and including 6.3.2 allows an attacker to crash the server via submitting a maliciously crafted POST body.\"\n\nCWE-121 is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is the preferred level according to the mapping guidance. Other CWEs were considered but ultimately deemed less appropriate. CWE-674, while related to stack exhaustion, is more about uncontrolled recursion, whereas this vulnerability is triggered by a crafted input. Therefore, CWE-121 is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory

file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**:

sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may\n         become a very",
