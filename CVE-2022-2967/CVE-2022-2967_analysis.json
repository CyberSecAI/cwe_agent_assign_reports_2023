CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is a child of CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication). While CWE-522 is a Class, the vulnerability description directly mentions \"**do not sufficiently protect credentials**\", making it a more precise match than its parents. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is considered as a potential impact, but not the root cause, thus is marked as secondary.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe522 -->|ChildOf| cwe1390\n    cwe522 -->|ChildOf| cwe287\n    cwe522 -->|ChildOf| cwe668\n    cwe200 -->|ChildOf| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe522 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe1390,cwe287,cwe668 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient protection of credentials**, leading to the impact of an **attacker** being able to **obtain user credentials** and **gain access to system data**.\n\nRoot Cause: **Insufficiently Protected Credentials (CWE-522)**\nImpact: Exposure of Sensitive Information (CWE-200)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-522 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of \"**do not sufficiently protect credentials**\" in the vulnerability description and \"**Insufficiently Protected Credentials (CWE-522)**\" in the CVE reference links content summary. This aligns perfectly with CWE-522's description: \"The product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.\" The ultimate impact is the unauthorized access to system data, which can be represented by CWE-200, but is secondary to the credential protection issue.\n\nThe hierarchical relationships show that CWE-522 is a child of CWE-1390 and CWE-287, but those are higher-level classifications.\n\nThe final decision to assign CWE-522 as the primary CWE is based on the direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary.\nThe CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately represents the core issue of insufficiently protected credentials, and the retriever results also ranked CWE-522 as the top match.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale:

Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can

Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product
