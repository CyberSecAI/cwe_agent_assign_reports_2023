CWE-668 was considered but ultimately deemed less specific. The relationship informed the decision to favor CWE-402 as it more directly captures the transmission of private resources. CWE-916 was considered because it relates to password hashing, but it doesn't fully capture the vulnerability of disclosing password hashes of *other* users.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe402[\"CWE-402: Transmission of Private Resources into a New Sphere ('Resource Leak')\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n\n    cwe402 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n\n    class cwe402 primary\n    class cwe668 secondary\n    class cwe916 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **disclosure of password hashes** upon request. This leads to the **transmission of private resources** (the password hashes) into a new sphere where an authenticated user can access them. The impact is that the authenticated user can retrieve another user's password hash, potentially leading to further attacks like offline password cracking.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed towards CWE-402 as the primary weakness, which aligns with the **transmission of private resources** (password hashes) to an unauthorized actor (another authenticated user). This is supported by the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which states the \"**Root cause of vulnerability**: The software discloses password hashes of other users upon request.\"\n\nCWE-668 was also considered, but it is a higher-level class and \"Discouraged\" because it is a catch-all. CWE-402 is more specific and accurately describes the vulnerability. The Retriever Results also lists CWE-402 as the top combined result.\n\nCWE-916 was considered because password hashes are involved, but the core issue isn't the strength of the hash itself; it's the **disclosure** of the hash to unauthorized users. Therefore, while relevant, it's not the primary weakness.\n\nThe final decision to select CWE-402 is based on its specificity, alignment with the vulnerability description, and the evidence provided in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. It represents the root cause more accurately than the other considered CWEs and is at an appropriate level of abstraction (Class).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-402: Transmission of Private Resources into a New Sphere ('Resource Leak')\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product makes resources available to untrusted parties when those resources are only intended to be accessed by the product.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nResource Leak\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2003-0740:** Server leaks a privileged file descriptor, allowing the server to be hijacked.\n- **CVE-2004-1033:** File descriptor leak allows read of restricted files.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n### Extended Description\nResources such as files and directories may be inadvertently exposed through mechanisms such as insecure permissions, or when a program accidentally operates on the wrong object. For example, a program may intend that private files can only be provided to a specific user. This effectively defines a control sphere that is intended to prevent attackers from accessing these private files. If the file permissions are insecure, then parties other than the user will be able to access those files.\n\nA separate control sphere might effectively require that the user can only access the private files, but not any other files on the system. If the program does not ensure that the user is only requesting private files, then the user might be able to access other files on the system.\n\nIn either case, the end result is that a resource has been exposed to the wrong party.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-664\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n- Abstraction\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Theoretical]** A \"control sphere\" is a set of resources and behaviors that are accessible to a single actor, or a group of actors. A product's security model will typically define multiple spheres, possibly implicitly. For example, a server might define one sphere for \"administrators\" who can create new user accounts with subdirectories under /home/server/, and a second sphere might cover the set of users who can create or delete files within their own subdirectories. A third sphere might be \"users who are authenticated to the operating system on which the product is installed.\" Each sphere has different sets of actors and allowable behaviors.\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n### Extended Description\nMany password storage mechanisms compute a hash and store the hash, instead of storing the original password in plaintext. In this design, authentication involves accepting an incoming password, computing its hash, and comparing it to the stored hash.\n\nMany hash algorithms are designed to execute quickly with minimal overhead, even cryptographic hashes. However, this efficiency is a problem for password storage, because it can reduce an attacker's workload for brute-force password cracking. If an attacker can obtain the hashes through some other method (such as SQL injection on a database that stores hashes), then the attacker can store the hashes offline and use various techniques to crack the passwords by computing hashes efficiently. Without a built-in workload, modern attacks can compute large numbers of hashes, or even exhaust the entire space of all possible passwords, within a very short amount of time, using massively-parallel computing (such as cloud computing) and GPU, ASIC, or FPGA hardware. In such a scenario, an efficient hash algorithm helps the attacker.\n\nThere are several properties of a hash scheme that are relevant to its strength against an offline, massively-parallel attack:\n\n- The amount of CPU time required to compute the hash (\"stretching\")\n\n- The amount of memory required to compute the hash (\"memory-hard\" operations)\n\n- Including a random value, along with the password, as input to the hash computation (\"salting\")\n\n- Given a hash, there is no known way of determining an input (e.g., a password) that produces this hash value, other than by guessing possible inputs (\"one-way\" hashing)\n\n- Relative to the number of all possible hashes that can be generated by the scheme, there is a low likelihood of producing the same hash for multiple different inputs (\"collision resistance\")\n\nNote that the security requirements for the product may vary depending on the environment and the value of the passwords. Different schemes might not provide all of these properties, yet may still provide sufficient security for the environment. Conversely, a solution might be very strong in preserving one property, which still being very weak for an attack against another property, or it might not be able to significantly reduce the efficiency of a massively-parallel attack.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-328\nChildOf -> CWE-327\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction",
