CWE-212 has a `CanPrecede` relationship to CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data), which is also related to the observed impact of the vulnerability. CWE-267 is related to the **privilege** aspect of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe267[\"CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\"]\n\n    cwe212 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe201\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe212 primary\n    class cwe201,cwe267 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect privilege** assignment, leading to the **improper removal of sensitive information** during the variable preview, which in turn results in the exposure of sensitive data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **unmasking of sensitive variables** through the variable preview functionality. The retriever results and the vulnerability description both point towards CWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer) as a strong candidate, aligning with the core issue of sensitive data exposure due to **improper handling of sensitive variables**. The advisory indicates that certain roles had the `VariableEdit` permission, leading to exposure. This aspect is captured by CWE-267.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-212 being a Base-level CWE that directly addresses the **improper removal of sensitive information** before it's made accessible. This is supported by the vulnerability description, which states that it is possible to **unmask sensitive variables by using variable preview**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
