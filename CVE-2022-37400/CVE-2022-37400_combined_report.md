## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship considered was the ChildOf relationship between CWE-1204 and CWE-330 (Insufficient Entropy). While insufficient entropy could be a contributing factor to weak IV generation, the description specifically mentions the static nature of the IV, making CWE-1204 a more direct and accurate classification. The other potential CWEs like CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) and CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) were also considered but deemed less relevant because the core issue is the IV generation, not necessarily the key or algorithm itself.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **flaw in the encryption initialization vector**, specifically the use of a static IV. This **weakness** leads to the potential decryption of stored passwords if an attacker gains access to the user's configuration data.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on the **rootcause**, which is the **flaw in encryption initialization vector** because the required initialization vector for encryption was always the same. The retriever results clearly indicated CWE-1204 as the most relevant CWE, supported by a high score. The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary directly aligns with CWE-1204's description of using a cryptographic primitive with an IV that is not sufficiently unpredictable or unique. The impact is the potential decryption of stored passwords, but the root cause is the weak IV generation.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.896

**Description**:
The product uses a cryptographic primitive that uses an Initialization Vector (IV), but the product does not generate IVs that are sufficiently unpredictable or unique according to the expected cryptographic requirements for that primitive.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed

## CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.667

**Description**:
The product uses an algorithm or scheme that produces insufficient entropy, leaving patterns or clusters of values that are more likely to occur than others.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed

## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.510

**Description**:
The use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed

### Detailed Analysis and Justification for CWE-1204:

*   **How the Vulnerability Matches the CWE**: The vulnerability description states, "A flaw in OpenOffice existed where the required initialization vector for encryption was always the same which weakens the security of the encryption making them vulnerable if an attacker has access to the users configuration data." This directly reflects the core characteristic of CWE-1204, where the IV is not sufficiently unpredictable or unique.
*   **Security Implications and Potential Impact**: The use of a static IV weakens the encryption, allowing attackers with access to the configuration data to decrypt stored passwords. This could lead to unauthorized access to online accounts and services.
*   **Parent-Child Relationships**: CWE-1204 is a child of CWE-330 (Insufficient Entropy). While the description doesn't explicitly mention entropy, the use of a static IV inherently implies a lack of entropy. However, CWE-1204 is more specific and therefore a better fit.
*   **MITRE Mapping Guidance**: The mapping guidance for CWE-1204 indicates "Usage: Allowed" and "Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities." This confirms that CWE-1204 is an appropriate choice.
*   **Confidence**: The evidence is strong, and the description aligns almost perfectly with the CWE definition, resulting in high confidence.

### Other CWEs Considered and Rejected:

*   **CWE-331 (Insufficient Entropy)**: While related, the core issue is the static IV, not necessarily the overall entropy of the random number generation. CWE-1204 is more precise.
*   **CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key)**: The vulnerability doesn't mention hard-coded keys; it focuses on the IV.
*   **CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm)**: The algorithm itself might be fine, but the way it's being used with a static IV is the problem.
*   **CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials)**: Similar to CWE-321, the problem is not the credentials themselves, but the use of static IVs during encryption.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-37400

## Vulnerability Description
Apache OpenOffice supports the storage of passwords for web connections in the users configuration database. The stored passwords are encrypted with a single master key provided by the user. A flaw in OpenOffice existed where the required initialization vector for encryption was always the same which weakens the security of the encryption making them vulnerable if an attacker has access to the users configuration data. This issue affects Apache OpenOffice versions prior to 4.1.13. Reference CVE-2022-26306 - LibreOffice

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **flaw in encryption initialization vector**
- **impact:** decryption of stored passwords
- **attacker:** attacker with access to configuration data
- **product:** Apache OpenOffice
- **version:** prior to 4.1.13

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-37400:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of a static initialization vector (IV) during the encryption of stored web connection passwords in Apache OpenOffice.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Static Initialization Vector:** The encryption process uses the same IV every time, which significantly weakens the encryption.
- **Insecure Password Storage:** While passwords are encrypted using a master key, the flawed IV renders the encryption vulnerable to attacks if the attacker has access to the user's configuration data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with access to the user's configuration data can recover the stored web connection passwords, even without knowing the master password. This could lead to unauthorized access to online accounts and services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Access to Configuration Data:** An attacker needs access to the user's OpenOffice configuration data, which is where the encrypted passwords are stored.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires access to the user's configuration data. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
    - Compromising the user's machine.
    - Accessing a backup of the user's system.
    - Exploiting other vulnerabilities to gain access to the system/data.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" in severity.
- There are no known exploits in the wild but a proof-of-concept exists.
- The issue is fixed in Apache OpenOffice version 4.1.13 and later.
- OpenOffice.org versions may also be affected.
- The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2022-26306 which affected LibreOffice.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a cryptographic primitive that uses an Initialization
			Vector (IV), but the product does not generate IVs that are
			sufficiently unpredictable or unique according to the expected
			cryptographic requirements for that primitive.
			

### Extended Description
By design, some cryptographic primitives (such as block ciphers) require that IVs must have certain properties for the uniqueness and/or unpredictability of an IV. Primitives may vary in how important these properties are. If these properties are not maintained, e.g. by a bug in the code, then the cryptography may be weakened or broken by attacking the IVs themselves.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-330

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, "randomness" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-1472:** ZeroLogon vulnerability - use of a static IV of all zeroes in AES-CFB8 mode
- **CVE-2011-3389:** BEAST attack in SSL 3.0 / TLS 1.0. In CBC mode, chained initialization vectors are non-random, allowing decryption of HTTPS traffic using a chosen plaintext attack.
- **CVE-2001-0161:** wireless router does not use 6 of the 24 bits for WEP encryption, making it easier for attackers to decrypt traffic

**[Maintenance]** This is more like a category than a weakness.

**[Maintenance]** Many other types of encodings should be listed in this category.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2004-1315:** Forum software improperly URL decodes the highlight parameter when extracting text to highlight, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code by double-encoding the highlight value so that special characters are inserted into the result.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The main difference between the use of hard-coded passwords and the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys is the false sense of security that the former conveys. Many people believe that simply hashing a hard-coded password before storage will protect the information from malicious users. However, many hashes are reversible (or at least vulnerable to brute force attacks) -- and further, many authentication protocols simply request the hash itself, making it no better than a password.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29960:** Engineering Workstation uses hard-coded cryptographic keys that could allow for unathorized filesystem access and privilege escalation
- **CVE-2022-30271:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used by default.
- **CVE-2020-10884:** WiFi router service has a hard-coded encryption key, allowing root access




## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.

### Extended Description


Cryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.


It is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.


Since the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered "unsafe" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.


For a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.

**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30273:** SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity
- **CVE-2022-30320:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.
- **CVE-2008-3775:** Product uses "ROT-25" to obfuscate the password in the registry.




## CWE-1394: Use of Default Cryptographic Key
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a default cryptographic key for potentially critical functionality.

### Extended Description
It is common practice for products to be designed to use default keys. The rationale is to simplify the manufacturing process or the system administrator's task of installation and deployment into an enterprise. However, if admins do not change the defaults, it is easier for attackers to bypass authentication quickly across multiple organizations.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2018-3825:** cloud cluster management product has a default master encryption key
- **CVE-2016-1561:** backup storage product has a default SSH public key in the authorized_keys file, allowing root access
- **CVE-2010-2306:** Intrusion Detection System (IDS) uses the same static, private SSL keys for multiple devices and installations, allowing decryption of SSL traffic




## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

### Extended Description


Many file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as ".." and "/" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the "../" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as "/usr/local/bin" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.


### Alternative Terms
Directory traversal
Path traversal: "Path traversal" is preferred over "directory traversal," but both terms are attack-focused.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-706
ChildOf -> CWE-706
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add ".txt" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.

**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.

**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing "/" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).

**[Terminology]** 

Like other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use "directory traversal" only to refer to the injection of ".." and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.


Other variants like "absolute pathname" and "drive letter" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve ".." or equivalent.


**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.

**[Research Gap]** 

Incomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that "..\" is vulnerable, but not test "../" which may also be vulnerable.


Any combination of directory separators ("/", "\", etc.) and numbers of "." (e.g. "....") can produce unique variants; for example, the "//../" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama
- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the "\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)

## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.

### Extended Description
Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.
