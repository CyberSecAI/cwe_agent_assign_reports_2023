CWE-96 is a Base level CWE and a child of CWE-94. The relationship between CWE-79 and CWE-96 is that both involve **improper neutralization** but target different contexts: web page generation (XSS) versus static code injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe96[\"CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe96 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe96 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input sanitization**, leading to stored XSS and potential remote code execution. The chain is as follows:\n1.  **Improper Input Sanitization**\n2.  Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79)\n3.  Remote Code Execution (CWE-96)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the vulnerability as primarily related to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) due to **improper input sanitization**. Further analysis revealed that the vulnerability also allows for remote code execution (RCE) by injecting PHP code, even with certain security measures in place.\n\nThe selection of CWE-79 is based on the description stating that the plugin \"does not properly sanitize the body of the adverts injected into the pages, allowing a high privileged user (Admin+) to inject arbitrary HTML or javascript...leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating that \"Due to the lack of sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed when other users visit the affected pages.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-96 is based on the fact that it is also possible to inject PHP code, leading to Remote Code execution (RCE) vulnerability, even if the DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT and DISALLOW_FILE_MOD constants are both set. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"By injecting PHP code, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server. This is possible even when file editing is disabled using the `DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT` and `DISALLOW_FILE_MOD` constants.\"\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the weaknesses described in the vulnerability report. CWE-79 covers the stored XSS aspect, while CWE-96 addresses the potential for remote code execution through static code injection.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
