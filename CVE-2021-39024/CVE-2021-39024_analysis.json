CWE-79 is a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')). CWE-79 can precede CWE-494 (Download of Code Without Integrity Check) and is a peer of CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)). The relationship of CWE-79 and CWE-352 is notable in that an attacker might use CSRF to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. CWE-613 (Insufficient Session Expiration) is a child of CWE-672 and can precede CWE-287.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe494[\"CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check\"]\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe613[\"CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on a Resource after Expiry\"]\n\n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe79 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe494\n    cwe79 --|PEEROF| cwe352\n    cwe613 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe613 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe494,cwe352,cwe613,cwe672 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **cross-site scripting** vulnerability, which allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI. This can lead to the alteration of intended functionality, potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description, which clearly states that the IBM Guardium Data Encryption (GDE) product is vulnerable to **cross-site scripting**. This allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI, potentially leading to credentials disclosure.\n\n> IBM Guardium Data Encryption (GDE) 4.0.0.0 and 5.0.0.0 is vulnerable to **cross-site scripting**. This vulnerability allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI thus altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.\n\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')), which directly matches the vulnerability description. The retriever results also list CWE-79 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-613 (Insufficient Session Expiration) was considered as a secondary weakness due to the potential for credentials disclosure within a trusted session. While the description doesn't explicitly mention session expiration issues, the impact suggests that long-lived sessions could exacerbate the risk of XSS attacks leading to credentials theft. However, the evidence is weak, so it's a low confidence.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but deemed less relevant. For example, CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)) was considered because XSS can be used in conjunction with CSRF, but there is no direct evidence of CSRF in the vulnerability description.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-79 being a base-level CWE that directly addresses the **cross-site scripting** vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Technical Explanation:** The vulnerability allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI, which is a direct manifestation of CWE-79. The product fails to neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page.\n**Security Implications:** This can lead to alteration of intended functionality and potential credentials disclosure. An attacker can inject malicious scripts that steal cookies, redirect users to phishing sites, or perform other malicious actions.\n**Relationship to Other CWEs:** CWE-79 is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')). It is also a peer of CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)).\n**Mapping Guidance Influence:** The MITRE mapping guidance recommends using base-level CWEs when possible, and CWE-79 is a direct match for the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\n**Technical Explanation:** Although not explicitly stated, the potential for credentials disclosure within a trusted session suggests that the session might not expire quickly enough. This could allow an attacker to exploit the XSS vulnerability and gain access to the session for a prolonged period.\n**Security Implications:** If session expiration is insufficient, an attacker who has successfully injected malicious JavaScript code can maintain access to the user's session even after the user has left the site.\n**Relationship to Other CWEs:** CWE-613 is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-672 (Operation on a Resource after Expiry).\n**Mapping Guidance Influence:** The MITRE mapping guidance recommends using base-level CWEs when possible.",
