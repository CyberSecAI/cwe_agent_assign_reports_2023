While this is a Class level, there is not enough information to specify which kind of access control is **improper**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe284 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control** which leads to a user with user-level permissions being able to access a graphics protected region.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates an **improper access control** issue.\nThe evidence is the following:\n*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**\n    *   **rootcause:** **improper access control**\n*   **Vulnerability Description**\n    *   A user with user level permission can access graphics protected region due to **improper access control** in register configuration\n\nI am confident in this assessment because the description explicitly states \"**improper access control**\" as the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n## CWE-415: Double Free\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n-

Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE is not relevant to the vulnerability description which indicates an access control issue.*\n\n## CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction Level**:
