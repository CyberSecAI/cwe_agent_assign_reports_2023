# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2021-35112

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 1.0 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-284. While this is a Class level, there is not enough information to specify which kind of access control is **improper**.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control** which leads to a user with user-level permissions being able to access a graphics protected region.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly indicates an **improper access control** issue.
The evidence is the following:
*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**
    *   **rootcause:** **improper access control**
*   **Vulnerability Description**
    *   A user with user level permission can access graphics protected region due to **improper access control** in register configuration

I am confident in this assessment because the description explicitly states "**improper access control**" as the root cause of the vulnerability.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
## CWE-415: Double Free
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE is not relevant to the vulnerability description which indicates an access control issue.*

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*This CWE is not relevant to the vulnerability description which indicates an access control issue.*

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE is not relevant to the vulnerability description which indicates an access control issue.*

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE is not relevant to the vulnerability description which indicates an access control issue.*

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*This CWE is not relevant to the vulnerability description which indicates an access control issue.*

## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*This CWE is not relevant to the vulnerability description which indicates an access control issue.*

## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE is not relevant to the vulnerability description which indicates an access control issue.*

## CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense
**Description**:
The product obtains a value from an untrusted source, converts this value to a pointer, and dereferences the resulting pointer.
**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE is not relevant to the vulnerability description which indicates an access control issue.*

## CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 6168.86
**Source**: sparse
**Description**:
The product performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations for the resulting pointer.

**Similarity Score**: 6087.01
**Source**: sparse
**Description**:
The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.
