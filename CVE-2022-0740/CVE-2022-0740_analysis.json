Although CWE-284 is a high-level pillar and therefore discouraged, both CWE-285 and CWE-863 are more specific. The evidence clearly points to an **incorrect authorization** implementation, making CWE-863 the most suitable choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe284,cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves an **incorrect authorization** check, leading to the ability to close Asana tasks from unrestricted branches.\n  - The root cause is the **incorrect authorization** in the branch restriction feature.\n  - This leads to the impact of being able to close Asana tasks from unrestricted branches, effectively bypassing intended access controls.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identified **incorrect authorization** as the root cause. The detailed analysis confirms that CWE-863 is the most appropriate mapping, aligning with the provided evidence and mapping guidance. This decision is based on the fact that the system performs an authorization check, but that check is implemented incorrectly, leading to the vulnerability.\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description: \"**Incorrect authorization** in the Asana integrations branch restriction feature...makes it possible to close Asana tasks from unrestricted branches.\"\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by focusing on the child relationships that provide more granularity, especially with the presence of **incorrect authorization** mentioned in the description.\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **incorrect authorization** mechanism rather than a generic access control issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
