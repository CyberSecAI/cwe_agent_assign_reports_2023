CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) are Class level CWEs that are parent to several more specific Base and Variant level CWEs. The vulnerability involves an authenticated user being able to edit Code Monitors owned by another user. This can stem from either an incorrect authorization check (CWE-863) or a complete lack of an authorization check (CWE-862), both of which are related to the root cause of unverified ownership (CWE-283).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe283[\"CWE-283: Unverified Ownership\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe283\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe283 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper verification of ownership (CWE-283)**. This leads to either an **incorrect authorization (CWE-863)** or a **missing authorization check (CWE-862)**, which ultimately allows an attacker to **edit Code Monitors owned by other users**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the ability of an authenticated user to edit Code Monitors owned by other users, which suggests an authorization issue. The retriever results pointed to CWE-283 (Unverified Ownership), CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"It is possible for an authenticated Sourcegraph user to edit the Code Monitors owned by any other Sourcegraph user.\" The key phrase here is \"edit Code Monitors owned by any other Sourcegraph user.\" This indicates that the system **fails to properly verify if the user attempting to edit the Code Monitor is indeed the owner**.\n\nCWE-283 (Unverified Ownership) directly addresses this issue. The description states: \"The product does not properly verify that a critical resource is owned by the proper entity.\" This aligns perfectly with the vulnerability where the product (Sourcegraph) **does not properly verify that the user attempting to edit a Code Monitor is the owner of that Code Monitor**. Therefore, CWE-283 is the most accurate and specific CWE to represent the root cause of this vulnerability.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) are less specific. While they describe authorization issues, they don't pinpoint the root cause, which is the **failure to verify ownership before applying authorization checks**.\n\nThe final selection is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the definitions of the CWEs. CWE-283 is at the optimal level of specificity as it accurately represents the root cause, while CWE-863 and CWE-862 are more general classifications of the authorization issue. The retriever scores support this assessment, with CWE-283 being a strong candidate.",
