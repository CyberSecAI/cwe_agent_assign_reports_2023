The vulnerability involves a specific scenario where a sensitive cookie lacks the \"Secure\" attribute, leading to its transmission in cleartext. This specific case is better captured by CWE-614, while the broader issue of transmitting sensitive data in cleartext is represented by CWE-319. Therefore, while CWE-319 is relevant, CWE-614 provides a more accurate and granular classification of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe614[\"CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe614 -->|CHILDOF| cwe319\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe614 primary\n    class cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing security attributes (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite) on session cookie**.\n2.  **Weakness:** Session cookies are set via client-side JavaScript.\n3.  **Impact:** Session cookies transmitted in plaintext over the network when using unencrypted HTTP connections, allowing attackers to intercept them.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description clearly states that the application sets session cookies without applying security attributes, leading to the transmission of these cookies in plaintext. This aligns perfectly with CWE-614 (Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute), which is a Variant-level CWE. The retriever results also listed CWE-614 as the top candidate.\n\nThe analysis also considered CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) since the cookies are transmitted in plaintext. However, CWE-614 is more specific as it focuses on the **missing security attributes** on the cookie itself, which is the **root cause**.\n\nThe decision to prioritize CWE-614 was based on the evidence from the vulnerability description, the retriever results, and the CWE specifications, which all support this classification. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-614 also explicitly allows its use, further solidifying the choice.\n\nThe evidence supporting the selection of CWE-614 is:\n*   \"The application, after a successful login, sets the session cookie on the browser via client-side JavaScript code, without applying any security attributes (such as Secure, HttpOnly, or SameSite).\"\n*   \"Any attempts to browse the application via unencrypted HTTP protocol would lead to the transmission of all his/her session cookies in plaintext through the network.\"\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was considered but rejected because it is a Class-level CWE that is often misused and represents the impact rather than the root cause. The provided guidance also discourages its use in favor of more specific CWEs.\n\nCWE-1004 (Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag) was also considered, but the description states that other flags such as \"Secure\" and \"SameSite\" are also missing. Therefore, CWE-614 is a more suitable description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
