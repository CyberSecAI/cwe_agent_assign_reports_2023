The impact of this weakness is arbitrary code execution via Redfish, leading to high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description and the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases,\" which explicitly identifies \"**default credentials**\" as the **root cause**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms the impact as arbitrary code execution. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-1392 as a potential candidate.\n\nCWE-1392 is selected because it directly addresses the **root cause** of \"**default credentials**.\" CWE-1391 is considered as a broader class, and CWE-798 addresses hardcoded credentials which is a different case than default. The selection aligns with MITRE's mapping guidance, which suggests using the most specific base-level CWE when possible.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses default credentials (such as a passwords or cryptographic keys) for potentially critical functionality.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n### CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\n**CWE-1392**: Use of Default Credentials is the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**default credentials**\". This aligns perfectly with the CWE's description: \"The product uses default credentials (such as passwords or cryptographic keys) for potentially critical functionality.\" The security implication is that attackers can bypass authentication, leading to arbitrary code execution.\n### CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**CWE-1391**: Use of Weak Credentials is a secondary CWE because default credentials fall under the broader category of weak credentials. This CWE's description is: \"The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\" While applicable, it is less specific than CWE-1392.\n### CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**CWE-798**: Use of Hard-coded Credentials is a secondary CWE because while related to credential management issues, hardcoded credentials are not explicitly mentioned. The description of CWE-798 is: \"The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\" This CWE is less directly relevant than CWE-1392 because it focuses on credentials that are built into the product's code rather than default credentials that are intended to be changed.",
