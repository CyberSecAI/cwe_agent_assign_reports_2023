The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the use of **non-random IV values**, which directly aligns with the description of CWE-1204. |\n| CWE-908 | Use of Uninitialized Resource | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability description mentions **misplaced memory initialization**, suggesting that the memory used for IV generation might not have been properly initialized, leading to predictable or non-random values. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-1204, which has a parent CWE of CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values).

This affects connections (without AEAD) using AES-CBC or DES3 with TLS 1.1 or 1.2 or DTLS 1.1 or 1.2.

The description of CWE-1204, \"The product uses a cryptographic primitive that uses an Initialization Vector (IV), but the product does not generate IVs that are sufficiently unpredictable or unique according to the expected cryptographic requirements for that primitive,\" matches the vulnerability description almost perfectly.\n\nCWE-908 is a possible contributing factor. The **misplaced memory initialization** could mean the memory used for the IV wasn't initialized. However, the core issue is the resultant weak IV. The retriever results also listed CWE-908 as a possibility.\n\nCWE-329 (Generation of Predictable IV with CBC Mode) was considered, but it's more specific to CBC mode, whereas the vulnerability affects both AES-CBC and DES3. While CBC mode is mentioned, DES3 is not directly related. Therefore, CWE-1204 is more appropriate.\n\nOther CWEs like CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read), CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm), CWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy), and CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) were considered but ultimately deemed less relevant because they don't directly address the core issue of weak IV generation due to memory initialization problems.",
