This indicates a hierarchical relationship where CWE-122 is a specific type of out-of-bounds write occurring on the heap. No chain relationships are evident from the provided information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe788[\"CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After the End of the Intended Buffer\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    \n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe788\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe122 primary\n    class cwe788,cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Heap-based buffer overflow** (**CWE-122**) due to **improper** handling of crafted HTTP requests.\n2.  **Impact:** Execution of unauthorized code or commands.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and supporting evidence from the CVE reference links.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a \"**heap-based buffer overflow**\" exists in Fortinet FortiWeb. The CVE reference links confirm this, stating the \"**root cause of vulnerability:** A **heap-based buffer overflow** exists in the FortiWeb API v1.0 controller, specifically within the LogAccess and LogReport API functionality.\"\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-122 as a potential match.\n\nGiven the explicit evidence of a heap-based buffer overflow and the ALLOWED mapping guidance for CWE-122, it is the most appropriate CWE.\n\nCWE-122 is chosen because it precisely describes the weakness. It's a Variant-level CWE, providing specificity without being overly broad.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
