This is a base level CWE and is a child of CWE-119 **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**. The retriever results also showed that CWE-126 **Buffer Over-read** which is a variant of CWE-125.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    \n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe125\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe126 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is:\n1.  The OTFCC software attempts to read data from a buffer.\n2.  Due to an unspecified error, the software reads beyond the bounds of the buffer (**CWE-125**).\n3.  This out-of-bounds read causes a segmentation fault/violation, leading to a crash.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description states that OTFCC v0.10.4 has a segmentation violation. The vulnerability description key phrases note the impact as a segmentation violation. The CVE reference links content summary does not directly describe an out-of-bounds read, but the primary CWE match for similar CVE descriptions is CWE-125 **Out-of-bounds Read**. The retriever results also list CWE-125 as the top combined result. Given the segmentation violation and the suggestions from similar CVE descriptions and retriever results, the best CWE match is CWE-125.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6504.70\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-125 is at the optimal level of specificity and is the best fit for the vulnerability description.",
