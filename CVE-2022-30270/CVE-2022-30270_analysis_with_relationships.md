# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1392 | Use of Default Credentials | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-798 | Use of Hard-coded Credentials | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-1393 | Use of Default Password | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-1392 Use of Default Credentials because the device has preconfigured accounts with default credentials. CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials is also relevant because the device's credentials are hard-coded and not easily changed. CWE-1393 Use of Default Password is also relevant because the default credentials include default passwords. CWE-259 Use of Hard-coded Password is a variant of CWE-798 and describes the use of hard-coded passwords, but it's less specific than CWE-1392.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **default credentials**, which allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system, potentially leading to remote code execution and denial of service. The chain is as follows:

1.  **CWE-1392 Use of Default Credentials:** The device ships with preconfigured accounts that have **default credentials**.
2.  Unauthorized Access: An attacker uses the **default credentials** to gain access to the device via SSH.
3.  Remote Code Execution/Denial of Service: Once authenticated, the attacker can manipulate device configurations, achieve remote code execution, and cause a denial-of-service condition.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is the use of **default credentials** for the preconfigured accounts. This allows attackers to easily gain unauthorized access to the system.

The evidence for this assessment comes directly from the vulnerability description, which states that the Motorola ACE1000 RTU has **default credentials** and exposes an SSH interface with 5 preconfigured accounts that all have **default credentials**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating that the root cause is the use of hard-coded credentials for the SSH service.

The graph relationships support this assessment. CWE-1392, Use of Default Credentials, is a child of CWE-1391, Use of Weak Credentials, indicating a more specific type of weak credential usage. CWE-798, Use of Hard-coded Credentials, is also a child of CWE-1391, representing a different type of weak credential usage. CWE-1393, Use of Default Password, is a child of CWE-1392. CWE-259 Use of Hard-coded Password is a child of CWE-798.

I am selecting CWE-1392 as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly states the use of **default credentials**, and this CWE is at the Base level of abstraction. I am including CWE-798, CWE-1393, and CWE-259 as secondary CWEs to provide a more complete picture of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses default credentials (such as passwords or cryptographic keys) for potentially critical functionality.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1393: Use of Default Password
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-291: Reliance on IP Address for Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
