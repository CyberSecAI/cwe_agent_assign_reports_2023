# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-20 ([Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)) | Improper Input Validation | 0.7 | Class | Primary | Discouraged |
| CWE-1284 ([Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1284.html)) | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship impacting the decision is that CWE-1284 ([Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1284.html)) is a child of CWE-20 ([Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)). While CWE-20 ([Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)) is the identified **rootcause**, it is discouraged because there are more specific child CWEs. However, there isn't sufficient information to select a specific Variant of CWE-20 ([Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)). Therefore, it is more appropriate to select the Base CWE of CWE-1284 ([Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1284.html)).

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Input Validation** (CWE-20 ([Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html))), which could lead to viewing data, changing settings, impacting the availability of the software, or impacting a user's local machine.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified **Improper Input Validation** (CWE-20 ([Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html))) as the primary weakness, based on the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" which include "**rootcause:** **Improper Input Validation**". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary doesn't provide more detailed information, however, the Retriever Results identify CWE-20 ([Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)) as the top combined result. While the official MITRE mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-20 ([Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)) due to its frequent misuse and suggests considering lower-level children, without further information on what input is not being validated properly, it is difficult to assign a more specific CWE. One possible option is CWE-1284 ([Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1284.html)) since the impact could include impacting availability of the software or impacting a user's local machine. Since the vulnerability description states "when the user clicks a specially crafted link" this could indicate the size of the URL is not validated.

## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product receives input or data, but it does
        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the
        properties that are required to process the data safely and
        correctly.

### Extended Description


Input validation is a frequently-used technique for checking potentially dangerous inputs in order to ensure that the inputs are safe for processing within the code, or when communicating with other components. When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.


Input validation is not the only technique for processing input, however. Other techniques attempt to transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well (see CWE-138 for more examples.)


Input validation can be applied to:


  - raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.

  - metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size

Data can be simple or structured. Structured data can be composed of many nested layers, composed of combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or structured data.

Many properties of raw data or metadata may need to be validated upon entry into the code, such as:


  - specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.

  - implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size

  - indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures

  - symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.

  - well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax 

  - lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token

  - specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)

  - consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.

  - conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic 

  - equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same

  - authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data

Implied or derived properties of data must often be calculated or inferred by the code itself. Errors in deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor to improper input validation. 

Note that "input validation" has very different meanings to different people, or within different classification schemes. Caution must be used when referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it. For example, some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control to an attacker over an input when they should not be able to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred to as input validation.


Finally, it is important to emphasize that the distinctions between input validation and output escaping are often blurred, and developers must be careful to understand the difference, including how input validation is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a query. The name "O'Reilly" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, this valid name cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the "'" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis. It is also a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Consider lower-level children such as Improper Use of Validation Framework (CWE-1173) or improper validation involving specific types or properties of input such as Specified Quantity (CWE-1284); Specified Index, Position, or Offset (CWE-1285); Syntactic Correctness (CWE-1286); Specified Type (CWE-1287); Consistency within Input (CWE-1288); or Unsafe Equivalence (CWE-1289).
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
