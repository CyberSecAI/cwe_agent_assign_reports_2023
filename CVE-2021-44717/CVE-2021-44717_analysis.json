CWE-772 is a base CWE and a parent of CWE-775, representing a more general missing resource release. CWE-403 is another related CWE, representing the exposure of the file descriptor to an unintended control sphere.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe775[\"CWE-775: Missing Release of File Descriptor or Handle after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe772[\"CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\"]\n    cwe403[\"CWE-403: Exposure of File Descriptor to Unintended Control Sphere ('File Descriptor Leak')\"]\n    cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\"]\n\n    cwe775 -->|CHILDOF| cwe772\n    cwe775 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    cwe772 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    cwe404 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664\n    cwe403 -->|CHILDOF| cwe402\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe775 primary\n    class cwe772,cwe403 secondary\n    class cwe404,cwe664 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with file descriptor exhaustion, leading to the **erroneous closing of file descriptor 0**. This **missing release** results in misdirected I/O, potentially leading to data corruption or denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the root cause as an **erroneous closing of file descriptor 0 after file-descriptor exhaustion**. The detailed CVE reference summary supports this, highlighting that the `syscall.ForkExec` function **erroneously closes file descriptor 0** when file descriptors are exhausted.\n\nThe primary CWE selection is CWE-775 (Missing Release of File Descriptor or Handle after Effective Lifetime). This aligns with the vulnerability description, as the core issue is the **missing release** of a file descriptor. The description of CWE-775 states, \"The product does not release a file descriptor or handle after its effective lifetime has ended, i.e., after the file descriptor/handle is no longer needed.\" This accurately reflects the **root cause** described in the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-772 (Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime) was considered as a broader categorization since a file descriptor is a type of resource. However, CWE-775 is a more specific variant and is therefore preferred.\n\nCWE-403 (Exposure of File Descriptor to Unintended Control Sphere ('File Descriptor Leak')) was also considered, but it emphasizes the exposure aspect rather than the initial **missing release**, making it a less precise fit.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-775 is at the optimal level of specificity, being a Variant that directly addresses the **missing release** of a file descriptor.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, i.e., after the resource is no longer needed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**:

Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize a critical resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses or accesses a resource that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 6463.99",
