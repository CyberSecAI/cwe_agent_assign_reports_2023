This **improper input validation** leads to undefined MMIO access, which can result in a denial-of-service condition.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states \"**Improper input validation** for some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially cause a denial of service via local access.\"\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary also supports this, stating: \"Root Cause of Vulnerability: **Improper input validation** in the Memory Mapped I/O (MMIO) implementation of some 14nm Client/Xeon E3 Intel\u00ae Processors.\"\n\nWhile CWE-20 is a Class-level CWE and typically discouraged, the provided information does not offer sufficient detail to pinpoint a more specific Base-level CWE. However, considering the MMIO context, CWE-1256 (Improper Restriction of Software Interfaces to Hardware Features) is also relevant. It's related because the vulnerability involves how software interfaces with hardware features (MMIO) are improperly restricted, allowing undefined access.\n\nCWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) were considered but deemed less suitable. CWE-691 is too abstract (Pillar), and CWE-284, while relevant, doesn't directly address the input validation aspect.\n\nCWE-1288 (Improper Validation of Consistency within Input) and CWE-1285 (Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input) are children of CWE-20 but don't fit the specifics of this vulnerability as well as CWE-1256.\n\nCWE-1173 (Improper Use of Validation Framework) is a child of CWE-20, but the information is lacking on if an Input Validation Framework was used and improperly implemented.\n\nTherefore, the selected CWEs (CWE-20 and CWE-1256) are considered to be at the optimal level of specificity given the available information.",
