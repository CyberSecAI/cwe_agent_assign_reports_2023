However, given the provided information, CWE-862 is the most appropriate high-level classification. CWE-280 (Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges) is considered as a secondary candidate because it is a base-level CWE related to permissions and privileges.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe280[\"CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\"]\n\n    cwe280 -->|ChildOf (Inferred)| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe280 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a **missing permission check** (CWE-862) leading to local information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) as the primary candidate, supported by the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" which states \"**missing permission check**\". The retriever results also list CWE-862 as the top combined result. The vulnerability description directly points to a **missing permission check** within the wlan driver, potentially leading to local information disclosure.\n\nThe final decision to assign CWE-862 as the primary CWE is based on the direct evidence of a **missing permission check**.
