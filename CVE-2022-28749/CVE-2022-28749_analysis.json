CWE-285 is a discouraged mapping because it is too high-level, and its children should be considered instead. The vulnerability description specifically mentions that the software \"fails to properly check the permissions,\" which aligns directly with the definition of incorrect authorization. There are no explicit chain relationships apparent from the provided information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to properly check permissions** (CWE-863), which leads to a threat actor being able to **join the meeting without consent of the host**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the description \"fails to properly check the permissions of a Zoom meeting attendee\" strongly suggests an authorization issue. The retriever results also list CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) as a potential candidate with \"Allowed-with-Review\" usage, and a relatively high score.\n\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization) was also considered, as it is a parent of CWE-863. However, the MITRE guidance discourages the use of CWE-285 because it's too high-level, and more specific child CWEs should be preferred.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-863 is based on the direct match between the vulnerability description and the CWE's definition. The vulnerability explicitly states that the software \"fails to properly check the permissions,\" which is precisely what CWE-863 describes: \"The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\"\n\nThe selected CWE is at the Class level, which is appropriate given the available evidence. While a more specific Base or Variant CWE might exist, the current information doesn't provide enough detail to justify a more granular mapping.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive -
