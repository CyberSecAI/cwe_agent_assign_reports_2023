It is a child of CWE-1390 [Weak Authentication]. The primary reason for selecting CWE-305 is that the vulnerability description explicitly states a **permission bypass**, which aligns with bypassing authentication due to a separate, primary weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe305[\"CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe305 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe305 primary\n    class cwe1390 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **permission bypass** in the Tokensync of the security subsystem. This allows LAN attackers to bypass the distributed permission control. The impact is that LAN attackers can bypass the distributed permission control, but they need another vulnerability to obtain system access first. The primary weakness, leading to the bypass, is best captured by CWE-305 [Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness].\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered several CWEs, especially those related to authorization and authentication bypasses. However, the key phrase \"permission bypass\" and the summary indicating that \"Tokensync in the security subsystem has a permission bypass vulnerability\" pointed towards an authentication or authorization issue.\n\nThe primary CWE selection, CWE-305 [Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness], is based on the evidence that the vulnerability involves bypassing permission control due to a separate weakness, even though the exact nature of that primary weakness is not specified in detail. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states: \"Tokensync in the security subsystem has a permission bypass vulnerability\". This aligns with the description of CWE-305.\n\nOther CWEs considered, such as CWE-285 [Improper Authorization], CWE-732 [Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource], and CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function], were deemed less appropriate because they describe missing or incorrect authorization or authentication mechanisms rather than a bypass due to a separate primary weakness. CWE-305 is at the optimal level of specificity because it captures the essence of the vulnerability without requiring detailed knowledge of the underlying primary weakness causing the bypass.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
