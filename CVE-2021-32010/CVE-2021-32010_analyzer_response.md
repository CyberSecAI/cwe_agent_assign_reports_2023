## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of root cause and weaknesses that followed for the Vulnerability Description:
  - Root Cause: **Inadequate Encryption Strength**
  - Impact: Man in the middle attacks

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis strongly pointed towards CWE-326 (**Inadequate Encryption Strength**) due to the explicit mention of the term in the vulnerability description. The retriever results also listed CWE-326 as the top candidate.

The evidence is the vulnerability description which states: "**Inadequate Encryption Strength** vulnerability in TLS stack of Secomea SiteManager, LinkManager, GateManager may facilitate man in the middle attacks."

CWE-326 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **root cause** identified in the vulnerability description. While it is a Class-level CWE, there are no more specific Base or Variant level CWEs available that would be a better fit.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
**Abstraction:** Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores or transmits sensitive data using an encryption scheme that is theoretically sound, but is not strong enough for the level of protection required.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
