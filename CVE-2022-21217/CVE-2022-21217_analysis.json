CWE-787 is a more specific case of CWE-119, accurately describing the vulnerability. There are no relevant CANPRECEDE or CANFOLLOW relationships to consider in this case.

In many cases, lower-level children or descendants are more appropriate. However, sometimes this weakness is forced to be used due to the lack of in-depth weakness research.
