However, the vulnerability description explicitly states \"**missing permission check**\" which aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-862. The secondary CWE, CWE-223 **Omission of Security-relevant Information** is a base level CWE and is related to information disclosure, which is an impact of the **missing permission check**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe223[\"CWE-223: Omission of Security-relevant Information\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe223 -->|CHILDOF| cwe221\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe223 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing permission check** (CWE-862), which leads to local information disclosure about enabled notification listeners. The chain is: Missing Authorization -> Information Disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points towards CWE-862 because the description explicitly states a **missing permission check**. This is further supported by the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" which lists \"**missing permission check**\" as the root cause. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also highlights an \"Information Disclosure\" issue, which could be considered an impact of the **missing permission check**.\n\nThe Retriever Results list CWE-862 as the top candidate. While CWE-862 is a Class-level CWE and the Mapping Guidance suggests examining children of this entry to see if there is a better fit, the direct and explicit mention of a **missing permission check** makes it the most appropriate choice.\n\nCWE-223, Omission of Security-relevant Information, was also considered because the lack of the permission check leads to the omission of security-relevant information. However, this is an indirect consequence, and CWE-862 more accurately reflects the root cause.\n\nI am confident in the selection of CWE-862 as the primary CWE because of the direct evidence in the vulnerability description. CWE-223 is a secondary candidate because it represents an impact of the primary weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
