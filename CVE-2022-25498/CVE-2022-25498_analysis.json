CWE-96 is a child of CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')). CWE-95 is a variant of CWE-94.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe96[\"CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe95[\"CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe96 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe95 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe96 primary\n    class cwe95 secondary\n    class cwe94 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of user-supplied data, which is then injected into the `/Configuration.php` file. This leads to remote code execution. The chain is:\n\n1.  **Improper Neutralization (CWE-96)**: The `saveConfigData` function doesn't sanitize the `file` parameter.\n2.  **Code Injection (CWE-96)**: Malicious code is directly injected into the PHP configuration file.\n3.  **Remote Code Execution (Impact)**: The injected code allows arbitrary PHP code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability involves a remote code execution in CuppaCMS due to the `saveConfigData` function not properly sanitizing user-supplied data before using it to update the `/Configuration.php` file. The `file` parameter, which is base64 encoded, is decoded and then directly injected into the configuration file.\n\nThe primary CWE is **CWE-96 (Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection'))**. This is because the vulnerability involves injecting code into a configuration file, which is a statically saved code resource. The vulnerability description states: \"The `saveConfigData` function in `/classes/ajax/Functions.php` not properly sanitizing user-supplied data before using it to update the `/Configuration.php` file.\" This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-96, which states: \"The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.\"\n\nCWE-95 (Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')) was considered because the injected code uses `eval()` to execute arbitrary code. However, the code is first injected into a static file (Configuration.php), and then it's dynamically evaluated. Therefore, CWE-96 is more appropriate as the primary weakness because it captures the initial injection into the static file. CWE-95 could be a secondary weakness as the eval function is the method used to run the injected code.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the weakness. CWE-96 is a Base level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
