CWE-269 is a Class-level CWE, and while it has no children listed in the provided information, the guidance suggests reviewing children for a more specific fit. Given the evidence, and the lack of more granular information, the Class level is appropriate. CWE-200 is a potential impact of the **improper privilege management**, but the root cause is the focus.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|RESULTANT| cwe269\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe269 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with **improper privilege management** (CWE-269), leading to information disclosure (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-269 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of \"**improper privilege management**\" in the vulnerability description. The retriever results also listed CWE-269 as the top candidate. While CWE-269 is a Class-level CWE, the available information does not allow for a more specific mapping to a Base or Variant. The vulnerability description key phrases highlight the **root cause** as \"**improper privilege management**\" and the impact as \"information disclosure,\" solidifying the choice of CWE-269 as the primary weakness and CWE-200 as the secondary weakness.\n\nThe selection is primarily based on the evidence: \"IBM Db2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows 9.7, 10.1, 10.5, 11.1, and 11.5 may be vulnerable to an information disclosure caused by **improper privilege management** when table function is used.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision by highlighting that CWE-200 is a potential consequence of CWE-269, but CWE-269 is the **root cause**.\n\nCWE-269 is at the optimal level of specificity given the available information. While it's a Class, a more detailed Base or Variant CWE would require more information about the specific mechanism of the **improper privilege management**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Why not used**: The vulnerability is not about inserting sensitive information into externally accessible files, but about **improper privilege management**.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Why not used**: CWE-668 is too high-level and doesn't accurately capture the **improper privilege management** aspect.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Why not used**: The vulnerability is not directly related to reliance on untrusted inputs.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Why not used**: The vulnerability isn't about failing to remove sensitive data before reuse.\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n**Why not used**: The vulnerability is not explicitly about generating error messages containing sensitive information.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Why not used**: The vulnerability is more specifically about **improper privilege management** rather than general exposure of system information.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Why not used**: The vulnerability is not about the product failing to handle insufficient privileges, but about assigning privileges incorrectly.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Why not used**: The vulnerability is not about validating unsafe equivalences in input.\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Why not used**: The vulnerability is not about timing discrepancies in responses.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Why not used**: The vulnerability is not about failing to remove sensitive information before storage or transfer.\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 7562.12\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n**Why not used**: While related to authorization, the provided information explicitly mentions \"**improper privilege management**\" which is a broader concept than simply incorrect authorization checks.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 7520.32\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Why not used**: This CWE is too specific and doesn't match the general **improper privilege management**.\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 7507.97\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Why not used**: The vulnerability is not related to concurrent execution or race conditions.\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 7505.17\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between",
