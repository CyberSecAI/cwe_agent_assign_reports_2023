CWE-319 is a specific type of information exposure (transmission) and CWE-359 is exposure of private information. The choice of CWE-319 was influenced by the explicit mention of \"plaintext\" and \"HTTP\" transmission in the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe311 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe359 secondary\n    class cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the **transmission** of PII in **cleartext**, leading to the **exposure** of this sensitive data to unauthorized parties.\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing encryption** for sensitive data during transmission. This is implied because the vulnerability description explicitly states \"sends...in plaintext using HTTP\".\n2.  **Weakness:** **Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319)**: The PII is sent without encryption over HTTP.\n3.  **Impact:** **Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-359)**: As a result of the cleartext transmission, the PII can be intercepted by unauthorized actors.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the type of information being exposed. The vulnerability description clearly states that PII is being sent in plaintext using HTTP.\n\n> \"It sends the following Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in plaintext using HTTP to servers located in China users list of installed apps and device International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI).\"\n\nThis evidence strongly supports **CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information)** as the primary weakness because it directly addresses the **transmission of sensitive information in cleartext**. The fact that the information is transmitted over HTTP, which is susceptible to sniffing, further reinforces this classification.\n\n**CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor)** is also relevant because the **transmission of PII in plaintext** ultimately leads to the **exposure** of this information to unauthorized actors. However, it's a secondary consequence of the **cleartext transmission**.\n\nOther CWEs, such as those related to hard-coded credentials, were considered but ultimately rejected because they did not directly address the core issue of **unencrypted transmission**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the identified weakness and its immediate impact. **CWE-319** accurately describes the technical flaw (cleartext transmission), while **CWE-359** captures the resulting privacy breach (exposure of PII).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-213: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product's intended functionality exposes information to certain actors in accordance with the developer's security policy, but this information is regarded as sensitive according to the intended security policies of other stakeholders such as the product's administrator, users, or others whose information is being processed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
