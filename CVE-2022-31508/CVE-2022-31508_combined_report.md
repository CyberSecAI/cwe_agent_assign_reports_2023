## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-36 **Absolute Path Traversal**, which is a specific type of path traversal where the attacker uses an absolute path to access files outside the intended directory. It is a child of CWE-22 **Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**, which represents the broader class of path traversal vulnerabilities. CWE-73 **External Control of File Name or Path** can precede CWE-36, as it describes the scenario where user input influences the file path, which is a prerequisite for path traversal.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with CWE-73 **External Control of File Name or Path**, where the attacker can influence the file path used by the application. This leads to CWE-36 **Absolute Path Traversal**, where the attacker uses an absolute path to access unauthorized files. The final impact is information disclosure, as the attacker can read sensitive files on the server.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified CWE-36 **Absolute Path Traversal** as the primary candidate because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions "**absolute path traversal**" and the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" indicates that the use of `os.path.join` with untrusted input allows absolute path traversal.

The retriever results and the complete CWE specifications support this choice, with CWE-36 being a base level CWE and having a high similarity score. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-36 is a specific type of path traversal, making it a suitable choice.

CWE-22 **Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')** was considered as a broader category, but CWE-36 is more specific to the described vulnerability. CWE-73 **External Control of File Name or Path** was also considered as it highlights the external control aspect of the file path, but it's a prerequisite rather than the core weakness.

The final decision is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description, the retriever results, and the relationship analysis, which all point to CWE-36 as the most accurate and specific classification.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-31508

## Vulnerability Description
The idayrus/evoting repository before 2022-05-08 on GitHub allows **absolute path traversal** because the Flask send_file function is used unsafely.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **absolute path traversal**
- **product:** idayrus/evoting repository
- **version:** before 2022-05-08

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the use of `flask.send_file` with user-controlled input, specifically the `filename` parameter. Additionally, using `os.path.join` with untrusted input is also a root cause, as `os.path.join` ignores preceding paths when it encounters an absolute path, making it unsafe for joining a static path with user provided paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The application is vulnerable to path traversal attacks due to the insecure handling of file paths when using `flask.send_file`. This allows an attacker to potentially access files and directories outside of the intended web root directory.
*   **Unsafe use of `os.path.join`:** When the `os.path.join` function encounters an absolute path, it discards the preceding paths provided and uses only the absolute path. This can lead to path traversal if an attacker is able to supply an absolute path as a parameter to the `os.path.join` call.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server's file system, potentially including sensitive data like application source code, configuration files, and system files, leading to information disclosure.
*   **Partial Denial of Service:**  An attacker may repeatedly request large files leading to a partial system denial of service due to resource exhaustion.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** By manipulating the `filename` or `path` parameter within HTTP requests, an attacker can inject path traversal sequences such as `../` or absolute paths to access files outside of the intended directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the specific endpoint that uses the vulnerable `flask.send_file` or `os.path.join` functions.
*   **Ability to craft malicious file paths:** The attacker must be able to craft a path containing `../` sequences or provide an absolute path.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content includes discussions and references to multiple projects that were found to be vulnerable, highlighting the widespread nature of this vulnerability pattern.
*   The vulnerability was discovered using CodeQL by Github, which can detect code patterns that could lead to security issues.
*   The discussions also reveal controversy around requesting CVEs for small, personal projects that are not intended for public consumption.

The provided content is more detailed than a typical CVE description by providing the root cause analysis, remediation advice, proof-of-concept, and CVSS vector score.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

### Extended Description


Many file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as ".." and "/" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the "../" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as "/usr/local/bin" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.


### Alternative Terms
Directory traversal
Path traversal: "Path traversal" is preferred over "directory traversal," but both terms are attack-focused.

### Relationships

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add ".txt" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.

**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.

**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing "/" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).

**[Terminology]** 

Like other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use "directory traversal" only to refer to the injection of ".." and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.


Other variants like "absolute pathname" and "drive letter" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve ".." or equivalent.


**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.

**[Research Gap]** 

Incomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that "..\" is vulnerable, but not test "../" which may also be vulnerable.


Any combination of directory separators ("/", "\", etc.) and numbers of "." (e.g. "....") can produce unique variants; for example, the "//../" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama
- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the "\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)




## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as "/abs/path" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

- **CVE-2002-1345:** Multiple FTP clients write arbitrary files via absolute paths in server responses
- **CVE-2001-1269:** ZIP file extractor allows full path




## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

### Extended Description


This could allow an attacker to access or modify system files or other files that are critical to the application.


Path manipulation errors occur when the following two conditions are met:

```
		1. An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.
		2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.
```
For example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker.

**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** CWE-114 is a Class, but it is listed a child of CWE-73 in view 1000. This suggests some abstraction problems that should be resolved in future versions.

**[Relationship]** 

The external control of filenames can be the primary link in chains with other file-related weaknesses, as seen in the CanPrecede relationships. This is because software systems use files for many different purposes: to execute programs, load code libraries, to store application data, to store configuration settings, record temporary data, act as signals or semaphores to other processes, etc.


However, those weaknesses do not always require external control. For example, link-following weaknesses (CWE-59) often involve pathnames that are not controllable by the attacker at all.


The external control can be resultant from other issues. For example, in PHP applications, the register_globals setting can allow an attacker to modify variables that the programmer thought were immutable, enabling file inclusion (CWE-98) and path traversal (CWE-22). Operating with excessive privileges (CWE-250) might allow an attacker to specify an input filename that is not directly readable by the attacker, but is accessible to the privileged program. A buffer overflow (CWE-119) might give an attacker control over nearby memory locations that are related to pathnames, but were not directly modifiable by the attacker.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)
- **CVE-2008-5748:** Chain: external control of values for user's desired language and theme enables path traversal.
- **CVE-2008-5764:** Chain: external control of user's target language enables remote file inclusion.




## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

### Extended Description
This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.

### Alternative Terms
Zip Slip: "Zip slip" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282]. It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).

### Extended Description


This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.


The "../" manipulation is the canonical manipulation for operating systems that use "/" as directory separators, such as UNIX- and Linux-based systems.

### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** 

Link following vulnerabilities are Multi-factor Vulnerabilities (MFV). They are the combination of multiple elements: file or directory permissions, filename predictability, race conditions, and in some cases, a design limitation in which there is no mechanism for performing atomic file creation operations.


Some potential factors are race conditions, permissions, and predictability.

- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Overlaps regular expressions, although an implementation might not necessarily use regexp's.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2004-0815:** "/.////" in pathname collapses to absolute path.
- **CVE-2005-3123:** "/.//..//////././" is collapsed into "/.././" after ".." and "//" sequences are removed.
- **CVE-2002-0325:** ".../...//" collapsed to "..." due to removal of "./" in web server.
