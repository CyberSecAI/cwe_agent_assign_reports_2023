This is a Base level CWE, providing a specific description of the weakness. CWE-494, download of code without integrity check, and CWE-807, Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision, are chosen as secondary CWEs to provide a more complete picture of the attack vector.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe295[\"CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\"]\n    cwe494[\"CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check\"]\n    cwe807[\"CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\"]\n\n    cwe494 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe295\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe295 primary\n    class cwe494,cwe807 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper certificate validation** (CWE-295), allowing the attacker to bypass the integrity check of the software image (CWE-494) which leads to the execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation, command execution, authentication and authorization bypass, running unsigned software and denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **improper validation** of the digital signature of the firmware image before installation (CWE-295). The device accepts and installs unsigned or maliciously modified firmware images because of this **lack of proper digital signature verification.** This allows the attacker to completely compromise the router by loading malicious software.\n\nThe description explicitly states that the device \"fails to properly validate the digital signature of the firmware image before installation,\" directly corresponding to CWE-295. Given the available information and the direct correlation between the vulnerability description and the CWE definition, a high confidence score of 0.9 is assigned.\n\nThe retriever results also suggest CWE-295 as the best match.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-787: Although it is listed as the primary CWE match in the \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section, the root cause is not an out-of-bounds write but rather the **improper certificate validation.**\n*   CWE-20: Improper Input Validation is too broad. The issue is specifically related to certificate validation.\n*   CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input is not relevant as the vulnerability does not involve validating a quantity.\n*   CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') is not relevant because the vulnerability is not related to command injection.\n*   CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check - This is a good secondary match since after bypassing certificate validation, the router will allow the download of code without integrity check.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
