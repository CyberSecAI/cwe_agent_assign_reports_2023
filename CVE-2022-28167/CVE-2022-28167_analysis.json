CWE-532 directly addresses the logging of sensitive data, while CWE-200 is a more general case of information exposure. The vulnerability involves logging a password in plaintext, thus CWE-532 is the more specific and appropriate choice. There is also a parent-child relationship between CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) and CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe256,cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **improper logging** of the password, leading to the password being stored in plaintext, ultimately resulting in potential unauthorized access.\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper Logging** (inferred, not explicitly a CWE).\n2.  CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File.\n3.  CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password.\n4.  Impact: Potential unauthorized access to Brocade Fabric OS switches.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **improper logging** as the root cause. The vulnerability involves Brocade SANnav logging the Brocade Fabric OS switch password in plain text in `asyncjobscheduler-manager.log`.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File). This is based on the vulnerability description stating that the password is being logged in plain text. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section confirms this by stating: \"The Brocade SANnav software logs the Brocade Fabric OS switch password in plain text within the `asyncjobscheduler-manager.log` file.\"\n\nCWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) was considered as a secondary CWE. While the password is being stored in plaintext, the primary issue is that it's being logged in the first place. CWE-532 captures the initial weakness of inserting sensitive information into the log file, making it the more direct and appropriate classification.\n\nThe graph relationships support the selection of CWE-532 because it highlights the direct action of inserting sensitive information into a log. CWE-256 describes the state of the password being stored in plaintext, which is a consequence of the logging. Therefore, the selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-532 representing the primary weakness and CWE-256 as a secondary contributing factor.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n#

product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 5659.64\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic
