More specific children may be appropriate. |\n| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.6 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged. Captures the impact but not the root cause. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-311, which is a class-level CWE. The description indicates that the vulnerability involves accessing unencrypted sensitive parameters, directly aligning with the concept of missing encryption. While CWE-311 is a class, its children, CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage) and CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission), are more specific. However, the provided description does not specify storage or transmission, so it is better to stick with CWE-311.\n\nCWE-200 represents the impact of the vulnerability (information exposure), rather than the root cause, so it is a secondary consideration. It is a child of CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe311 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe668 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of encryption** (CWE-311), leading to the **exposure of sensitive parameters** (CWE-200) to an attacker.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-311 as the primary weakness due to the **missing encryption** of sensitive parameters. The vulnerability description explicitly states that an attacker can access unencrypted sensitive parameters, which aligns directly with the definition of CWE-311. The evidence for this assessment is derived directly from the vulnerability description: \"allows an attacker to access certain **unencrypted sensitive parameters** which would otherwise be restricted.\"\n\nCWE-200 was considered as a secondary weakness, representing the impact of the missing encryption. However, it is classified as secondary because CWE-200 focuses on the exposure of information, while the root cause lies in the **lack of encryption**.\n\nThe graph relationships show how the exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200) is a consequence of a broader class of vulnerabilities related to exposing resources to the wrong sphere (CWE-668), but the direct cause is **missing encryption** (CWE-311).\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the vulnerability's root cause and impact. CWE-311 describes the **missing encryption**, while CWE-200 describes the resulting exposure of sensitive information.\nI have not selected CWEs that are not supported by the evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
