CWE-401 is more specific than its parents, as it focuses on memory resources. CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a related Class-level CWE that describes the impact of resource exhaustion, which is the result of failing to release memory in this case.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\"]\n    cwe772[\"CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\"]\n\n    cwe401 -->|CHILDOF| cwe772\n    cwe401 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    cwe400 -->|ParentOf| cwe401\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe401 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper memory resource release** (CWE-401), leading to **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400), and ultimately resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nBased on the provided information, the FTP server **fails to properly release memory resources** allocated for incomplete connection attempts, leading to a resource exhaustion when incomplete connection attempts are made repeatedly.\n\nThe **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** highlights the rootcause as an **improper memory resource release**.\n\nThe **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** provides additional information:\n*   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400):** The core issue is that memory resources are not properly released, leading to a resource exhaustion when incomplete connection attempts are made repeatedly.\n\nGiven this evidence, CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) is the most appropriate primary CWE. CWE-400 describes the impact (DoS), which is the result of the memory leak.\n\nCWE-170 (Improper Null Termination) was considered but deemed irrelevant because the vulnerability doesn't involve string termination issues. CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) was also considered but not selected, as the vulnerability is related to memory management and not buffer overflows. CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is too general and does not accurately reflect the specific weakness. CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) is irrelevant because password hashing isn't involved. CWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength) is also not applicable. CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input) is not relevant, as there's no buffer copy operation involved. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is not applicable since it is not an information exposure vulnerability. CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')) is not relevant because there's no code injection involved. CWE-84 (Improper Neutralization of Encoded URI Schemes in a Web Page) is also not applicable.\n\nCWE-401 is the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability: the **failure to release memory resources**. This is a Variant-level CWE, which is preferred for root cause mapping.",
