CWE-798, \"Use of Hard-coded Credentials,\" is a related CWE and a child of CWE-1391. The selection of CWE-1392 is based on the explicit mention of **default credentials** in the vulnerability description. The hierarchical relationships and abstraction levels were considered to ensure the most specific and accurate CWE was chosen.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1392[\"CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Weaknesses in Authentication or Authorization Configuration\"]\n\n    cwe1392 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1391\n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1391\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1392 primary\n    class cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the use of **default credentials** leading to information disclosure.\n  - **Root Cause:** Presence of **default credentials** for SNMPv1 and SNMPv2.\n  - **Weakness:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can perform an SNMP GET request using the **default credential**.\n  - **Impact:** An attacker can retrieve sensitive information from the device.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability stems from the presence of **default credentials** in Cisco FirePOWER and FMC software. The vulnerability description clearly states that an unauthenticated attacker can use these **default credentials** to retrieve sensitive information via SNMP GET requests. The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** section identifies \"**default credential**\" as the root cause. The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** confirms the root cause is the use of a **default credential** for SNMP versions 1 and 2.\n\nCWE-1392, \"Use of Default Credentials,\" is the most appropriate CWE because it directly addresses the root cause: the presence of **default credentials**. This is supported by the MITRE mapping guidance, which designates CWE-1392 as ALLOWED and at the Base level of abstraction.\n\nCWE-798, \"Use of Hard-coded Credentials,\" was also considered as a secondary candidate. However, the vulnerability description emphasizes that the credentials are \"default,\" implying a standard configuration rather than a completely hard-coded value specific to the implementation. Although the distinction can be subtle, **default credentials** often refer to a known, published set of credentials that are intended to be changed by the user, while hard-coded credentials are baked into the software and not easily changed. Because of the nuance, and because both might apply, CWE-798 is listed as a secondary candidate.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to the presence of **default credentials** as the root cause, justifying the selection of CWE-1392 as the primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
