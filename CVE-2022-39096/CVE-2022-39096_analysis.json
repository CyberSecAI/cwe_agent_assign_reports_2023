The secondary CWE, CWE-279 (Incorrect Execution-Assigned Permissions), is a variant that suggests an incorrect assignment of permissions during execution. While CWE-279 is more specific, the description focuses on the *missing* check rather than an incorrect assignment. CWE-862 is a parent of CWE-285 and CWE-284. CWE-732 is another potential candidate since it describes incorrect permission assignment for critical resources, but CWE-862 captures the root cause of a missing permission check, so it is preferrable.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe279[\"CWE-279: Incorrect Execution-Assigned Permissions\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    \n    cwe279 -->|CHILD_OF| cwe732\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe279,cwe732 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with a **missing permission check** (CWE-862), which leads to the ability to set up the power management service without the necessary privileges.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-862 as the primary candidate due to the **missing permission check**, which aligns directly with the CWE's description. The vulnerability description explicitly states the root cause as a **missing permission check**. The reference links do not have any vulnerability information, so they were not helpful. The description focuses on the absence of a check, making CWE-862 the most appropriate choice.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is based on the following evidence from the vulnerability description: \"In power management service, there is a **missing permission check**.\" This statement directly supports the mapping to CWE-862.\n\nThe retriever results also listed CWE-862 as the top candidate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
