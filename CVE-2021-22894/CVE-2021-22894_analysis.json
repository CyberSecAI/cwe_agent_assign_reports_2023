CWE-120 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), a Class level CWE. There are also potential chain relationships, such as CWE-120 potentially preceding CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n    \n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe123\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe120 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe123 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **buffer overflow** in Pulse Connect Secure, triggered by a maliciously crafted meeting room by a remote authenticated attacker, leading to the ability to execute arbitrary code as the root user. The root cause is the **lack of input size checking** before copying data into a buffer.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-120, which directly addresses the **buffer overflow** due to **missing size checks**. This aligns with the vulnerability description and the **Retriever Results**. The description clearly indicates a classic **buffer overflow** scenario.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"A **buffer overflow** vulnerability exists in Pulse Connect Secure before 9.1R11.4 allows a remote authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user via maliciously crafted meeting room.\"\n\nCWE-120 matches the root cause evidence, as it involves copying a buffer without verifying the input size, leading to an overflow.\n\nCWE-119 was considered but it is a class-level CWE and the description mentions it should be avoided for low-information vulnerability reports. The vulnerability report has sufficient information, thus the more specific CWE-120 is a better fit.\nCWE-190 was considered but it deals with integer overflows and wraparounds, and the provided information does not suggest any integer overflow issues.\nCWE-121 and CWE-122 were considered, but there isn't enough information to specify if the overflow is stack-based or heap-based, so the base CWE-120 is the best fit.\nCWE-287 was considered but the report mentions the attacker is authenticated. The authentication itself is not the root cause of the vulnerability.",
