This hierarchical relationship helps refine the classification to the most accurate representation of the vulnerability. CWE-113 is also related to CWE-20 and CWE-436, indicating that improper input validation and issues related to data streams can contribute to this type of vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe436[\"CWE-436: Unspecified Behavior\"]\n\n    cwe113 -->|ChildOf| cwe93\n    cwe113 -->|ChildOf| cwe20\n    cwe113 -->|ChildOf| cwe436\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences** (CWE-113), leading to **HTTP response splitting**. The root cause is the lack of proper input validation, which allows an attacker to inject malicious CRLF sequences into HTTP headers. This can lead to the compromise of a victim's browser/session.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly suggests CWE-113 as the primary CWE due to the vulnerability description explicitly mentioning **\"HTTP response splitting\"** and the **root cause** being the **\"improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers.\"** The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" further supports this by stating, \"Improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers, leading to HTTP response splitting.\"\n\nThe retriever results also indicate CWE-113 as the top match with a score of 1.0. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-113 states that it is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities, reinforcing its appropriateness.\n\nCWE-93, Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection'), was also considered as a potential candidate because CWE-113 is a child of CWE-93. However, CWE-113 is more specific as it directly involves HTTP Headers.\n\nThe selection of CWE-113 is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description and supporting information, making it the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
