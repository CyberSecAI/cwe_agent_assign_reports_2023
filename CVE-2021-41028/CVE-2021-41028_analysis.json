The secondary weakness is CWE-297, which deals with improper validation of certificates. Both CWE-321 and CWE-297 can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe297[\"CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch\"]\n    \n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe321 primary\n    class cwe297 secondary\n    class cwe798 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a hard-coded cryptographic key [CWE-321]** and **improper certificate validation [CWE-297]**. This allows an unauthenticated network-adjacent attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack. The root causes are CWE-321 and CWE-297, and the impact is the MitM attack.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which includes the vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **use of a hard-coded cryptographic key vulnerability [CWE-321]** and **improper certificate validation vulnerability [CWE-297]**. The CVE reference links content summary confirms these two weaknesses as the root causes of the vulnerability.\n\nThe relationship graph shows that CWE-321 is a child of CWE-798, making it a more specific classification. Both CWE-321 and CWE-297 are at the Variant level, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly represent the weaknesses described in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
