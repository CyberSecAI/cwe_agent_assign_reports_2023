CWE-415 **Double Free** is a peer of CWE-416, and both are variants of CWE-825 **Expired Pointer Dereference**.

This **improper access control** can lead to a **use-after-free** condition (CWE-416) or a **double-free** condition (CWE-415), which then results in memory corruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **improper access control sequence for AC database after memory allocation** leading to memory corruption. The retriever results suggested CWE-415 **Double Free**, CWE-416 **Use After Free**, and CWE-822 **Untrusted Pointer Dereference**.\n\nThe vulnerability description states that the **improper access control sequence** leads to memory corruption. This suggests that memory is being accessed after it has been freed, which aligns with CWE-416 **Use After Free**. A double-free condition (CWE-415) is also possible, but **use-after-free** seems slightly more probable given the evidence. It's less likely that an **untrusted pointer** is being directly dereferenced (CWE-822) even if that is possible too.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly relate to the **rootcause** of the vulnerability, which is an **improper access control** leading to memory corruption via **use-after-free** or **double-free** conditions.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product obtains a value from an untrusted source, converts this value to a pointer, and dereferences the resulting pointer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-415: Double Free\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-416: Use After Free\n**Abstraction Level**: variant\n**Similarity Score**: 4.53\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-416: Use After Free\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n### CWE Selection:\n\n*   **CWE-416: Use After Free**\n    *   **Technical Explanation:** The **improper access control sequence after memory allocation** strongly suggests that the memory is being accessed after it has been freed. This perfectly aligns with the description of CWE-416, where the product attempts to use memory that is no longer valid.\n    *   **Security Implications:** A **use-after-free** vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
