CWE-319 is a more specific type of CWE-311 and aligns better with the vulnerability description that focuses on **cleartext transmission**.\n\nCWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength) was considered due to the \"brute force attacks\" component of the description. While it could be a contributing factor, the primary issue appears to be the lack of encryption during transmission.\n\nCWE-294 (Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay) was considered because the vulnerability description mentions \"communication capture\". The attack involves capturing the transmitted data and potentially replaying it.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe326[\"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\"]\n    cwe294[\"CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\"]\n    \n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe326,cwe294 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **ROOT CAUSE:** Sensitive data (login password) is transmitted without sufficient encryption.\n2.  **WEAKNESS:** Attacker captures the communication.\n3.  **WEAKNESS:** Attacker decrypts the password using brute force.\n4.  **IMPACT:** Unauthorized access to the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nInitially, the \"brute force attacks\" phrase suggested CWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength), but the core issue is the **lack of encryption** during transmission. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions that an attacker can decrypt the password by capturing communication, which is a direct consequence of sending data in **cleartext**.\n\nThe evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" supports this: \"Insufficient protection of credentials during login authentication\" and \"Passwords can be decrypted by communication capture\".\n\nTherefore, the best mapping is CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) as the primary CWE, which is a Base level CWE. This aligns with the MITRE mapping guidance.\n\nOther CWEs like CWE-326 and CWE-294 are secondary because they describe contributing factors or potential attack vectors, but the root cause is the **cleartext transmission**.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **lack of encryption** during transmission, as evidenced by the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\".\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
