## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-352 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | 0.7 | Compound | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-89, which is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')). CWE-352 is a compound CWE that requires other weaknesses to be present. CWE-862 is a class-level CWE, and it represents a missing authorization check.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of escaping of user data when using it in SQL statements**, leading to **SQL injection**. The chain also includes missing authorization and CSRF checks, which allows any authenticated user to exploit the **SQL injection** vulnerability.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is **SQL injection** (CWE-89) due to **lacking escaping of user data when using it in SQL statements**. The vulnerability description key phrases state: "**lacking escaping of user data when using it in SQL statements**" and "**SQL injection**". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: "It also fails to properly sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries" and "SQL Injection (SQLI) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization and missing authorization checks." This clearly indicates CWE-89.

The vulnerability description also indicates a missing authorization check. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states, "The plugin lacks authorization and CSRF checks in various AJAX actions". This could be CWE-862, but it is a secondary issue as the **SQL injection** is the primary vulnerability.

CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)) is also mentioned. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: "No CSRF protection is in place." This would allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of a user without their consent.

I am overriding the retriever score for CWE-352 and CWE-862 and assigning a slightly lower confidence score due to the primary weakness being clearly **SQL injection**.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.81
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Why Not Used:** This CWE is not related to SQL injection.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Why Not Used:** While related to the concept of escaping, it is too general for the specific case of **SQL injection**. CWE-89 is more specific.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Why Not Used:** CWE-74 is a class-level CWE and too general. CWE-89, a child of CWE-74, is a better fit.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Why Not Used:** This CWE is not directly related to the root cause.

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Why Not Used:** This CWE is not directly related to the root cause.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Why Not Used:** While there is a missing authorization check, the core issue is **SQL injection**.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Why Not Used:** This CWE is not directly related to the root cause.

## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Why Not Used:** This CWE is too general. CWE-89 is more specific.

## CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

**Why Not Used:** This CWE is not related to **SQL injection**.

## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.

**Why Not Used:** This CWE is not related to **SQL injection**.

## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 3.32
**Source**: graph

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

**Why Not Used:** This CWE is for Cross-Site Scripting
