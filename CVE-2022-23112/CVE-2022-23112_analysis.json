Given the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **missing permission check**, CWE-862 was chosen over CWE-863 as it more accurately reflects the nature of the flaw. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) was considered as a related weakness, as authorization and authentication are closely linked, however since the description specified that the users already had overall/read access it was deemed to be secondary.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission check** (CWE-862), leading to the ability for attackers with Overall/Read access to connect to an attacker-specified SSH server using attacker-specified credentials.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **missing permission check**. The description clearly states that the Jenkins Publish Over SSH Plugin lacks proper authorization checks. This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), which describes a scenario where a product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\nThe Retriever Results also indicated CWE-862 as the top candidate, further supporting this classification. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-862 suggests that it is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate, prompting a review of its children. However, no child CWE provided a more specific fit than CWE-862 itself.\n\nCWE-306 was considered because the plugin is missing authentication, but the users already have overall/read access, so they are authenticated.\n\nThe decision to classify the vulnerability as CWE-862 is based on the direct evidence from the vulnerability description, the Retriever Results, and the MITRE mapping guidance. The selection of CWE-862 as the primary CWE provides an accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability's root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**:\n  - **rootcause:** **missing permission check**\n- **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**:\n  - **Missing permission check:** The plugin lacks proper authorization checks when performing connection tests.",
