The **command injection** is a separate but related flaw stemming from **insufficient neutralization** of input used to construct commands. This combination of weaknesses allows for **arbitrary host access**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which clearly states the presence of **path traversal**, **symlink processing**, and **command injection** flaws in go-getter.\n\n*   **CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'))** is selected as the primary CWE because the description explicitly mentions \"**path traversal**\". This aligns with the CWE's description: \"The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.\"\n*   **CWE-59 (Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following'))** is selected as a secondary CWE because the description also mentions \"**symlink processing**\". This aligns with the CWE's description: \"The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\"\n*   **CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'))** is selected as a secondary CWE because the description mentions \"**command injection** flaws.\" This aligns with the CWE's description: \"The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\"\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity (Base) and directly reflect the weaknesses described in the vulnerability.\n\n**CWEs Considered but Not Used:**\n\n*   **CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection'))**: While related to command injection, CWE-78 is more specific as it explicitly refers to OS commands.\n*   **CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection'))**: This is a more general injection CWE and less specific than CWE-78.\n*   **CWE-61 (UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following)**: While related to symlink processing, it's a compound CWE. CWE-59 is more direct and preferred.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:",
