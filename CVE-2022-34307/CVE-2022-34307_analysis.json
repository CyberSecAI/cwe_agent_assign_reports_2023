This means that CWE-614 is a more specific case of transmitting sensitive information in cleartext, where the sensitive information is a cookie and the lack of the 'Secure' attribute leads to the cookie being transmitted over HTTP. This hierarchical relationship supports the choice of CWE-614 as the more specific and appropriate classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe614[\"CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe614 -->|CHILDOF| cwe319\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe614 primary\n    class cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing 'Secure' Attribute** on a sensitive cookie.\n2.  **Weakness:** Cookie transmitted in cleartext over HTTP.\n3.  **Impact:** Attacker can sniff the traffic and obtain the cookie value, potentially leading to session hijacking or other attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified several candidate CWEs, with CWE-614 and CWE-319 being the most relevant. The final decision to prioritize CWE-614 as the primary weakness is based on its higher specificity and the explicit mention of cookies and the 'Secure' attribute in the vulnerability description.\n\nThe vulnerability description states \"IBM CICS TX 11.1 **does not set the secure attribute** on authorization tokens or session cookies. Attackers may be able to **get the cookie values** by sending a http// link to a user or by planting this link in a site the user goes to. The cookie will be **sent to the insecure link and the attacker can then obtain the cookie value by snooping the traffic**.\"\n\nThis quote demonstrates that the vulnerability directly relates to the **failure to set the Secure attribute** on cookies, leading to their transmission over insecure HTTP connections, which aligns perfectly with CWE-614.\n\nCWE-319 is considered a secondary candidate because it represents the broader issue of transmitting sensitive information in cleartext, which is a consequence of the primary weakness (missing 'Secure' attribute).\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-614 being a Variant that accurately captures the root cause and CWE-319 being a Base that describes the broader context.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product acts as an intermediary HTTP agent\n         (such as a proxy or firewall) in the data flow between two\n         entities such as a client and server, but it does not\n         interpret malformed HTTP requests or responses in ways that\n         are consistent with how the messages will be processed by\n         those entities that are at the ultimate destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions is not set, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
