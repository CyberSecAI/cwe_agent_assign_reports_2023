CWE-798 is a Base level CWE. CWE-321, Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key, CWE-259, Use of Hard-coded Password, and CWE-1391, Use of Weak Credentials are all children of CWE-798, but they are not as applicable as CWE-798 because the vulnerability is about a hard-coded file path, not specifically a password or key. While the vulnerability involves reading a configuration file, leading to a potential Incorrect Permission Assignment (CWE-732), the root cause is the hard-coded path itself. The hardcoded path is the key weakness that enables the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe1391 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe798 primary\n    class cwe732 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **hard-coded file path** (CWE-798), which leads to a situation where a normal user can create a malicious configuration file. Because the application **incorrectly assigns permissions to the configuration file** (CWE-732) due to the hardcoded path, the malicious file is loaded by the LDS running with high privileges, potentially leading to privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **hard-coded file path** (CWE-798) which enables a normal user to create a malicious configuration file.\nThe vulnerability description states that the \"OPC Foundation Local Discovery Server (LDS) through 1.04.403.478 uses a **hard-coded file path to a configuration file**.\"\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states that \"the Local Discovery Server (LDS) loads a configuration file from a hardcoded path, C:\\Build\\Projects\\UA-LDS\\stack\\openssl\\ssl\".\nBecause of the **hard-coded path**, the application **incorrectly assigns permissions to the configuration file** (CWE-732) which allows the malicious file to be loaded by the LDS running with high privileges, potentially leading to privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution.\n\nCWE-798 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the use of a **hard-coded file path**.\nCWE-732 is a secondary weakness that arises due to the **hard-coded path**, as it allows a normal user to create a malicious configuration file that can be loaded by the LDS running with high privileges.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Analysis:** This is the primary CWE because the root cause is a **hard-coded file path**, which can be considered a type of **hard-coded credential**.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Analysis:** While this CWE is related, it is not as specific as CWE-798 because it focuses on weak credentials in general, whereas the vulnerability is about a specific **hard-coded file path**.\n\n## CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Analysis:** This CWE is not directly applicable because the vulnerability is not about an insecure default value, but rather a **hard-coded file path**.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
