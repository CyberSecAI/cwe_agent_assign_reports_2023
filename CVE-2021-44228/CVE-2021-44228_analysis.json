CWE-917 is a child of CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command) and CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')). While CWE-74 is a parent of CWE-917, it is a class-level CWE and is thus less specific. The relationship shows that expression language injection is a specific type of injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe917[\"CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command\"]\n\n    cwe917 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe917 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe917 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe77 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation**, leading to the execution of arbitrary code.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Improper input validation** in the JNDI features of Log4j2.\n  - **Weakness:** **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')** (CWE-917)\n  - **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution due to attacker-controlled LDAP endpoints.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **improper input validation** within the JNDI features of Log4j2, which allows attackers to control LDAP endpoints and execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability description key phrases highlights the **rootcause** as **improper input validation**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section says, \"The vulnerability is due to the JNDI features in Apache Log4j2 not protecting against attacker-controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints.\" The primary CWE match is CWE-917. The decision to assign CWE-917 is based on its close match to the vulnerability description, particularly the **improper neutralization** of special elements in an expression language statement. The vulnerability enables remote code execution by injecting malicious code through log messages or parameters. The abstraction level of Base provides the most specific match. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-917 is a specialized form of CWE-74, making it the optimal choice for the primary CWE.\nCWE-74 was considered because the vulnerability involves injection. However, CWE-74 is a Class-level CWE and thus too general.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
