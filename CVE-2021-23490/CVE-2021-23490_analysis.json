This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-1333, which focuses on regular expressions with inefficient complexity causing excessive CPU cycles.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1333 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability \u2013 the inefficient regex.
