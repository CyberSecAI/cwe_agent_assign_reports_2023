## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the use of an **inefficient regular expression** (CWE-1333) in the `checkHeader` function, leading to catastrophic backtracking, which then results in excessive CPU consumption and ultimately a Denial of Service.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is the **inefficient regular expression** that leads to a denial of service. The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary, which explicitly mentions the **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)** and catastrophic backtracking.

The evidence clearly points to **CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity)** as the most appropriate CWE. The vulnerability description states that the `checkHeader` function uses a regex vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking, leading to excessive CPU consumption. This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-1333, which focuses on regular expressions with inefficient complexity causing excessive CPU cycles.

The selection of CWE-1333 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability â€“ the inefficient regex. While other CWEs like CWE-625 (Permissive Regular Expression) and CWE-185 (Incorrect Regular Expression) were considered, they are either too general or don't fully capture the essence of the vulnerability being triggered by the inefficient complexity of the regular expression.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.

### Extended Description
Some regular expression engines have a feature called "backtracking". If the token cannot match, the engine "backtracks" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.
 Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:


  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.

  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.

  - The input can be long enough.

 Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. 

### Alternative Terms
ReDoS: ReDoS is an abbreviation of "Regular expression Denial of Service".
Regular Expression Denial of Service: While this term is attack-focused, this is commonly used to describe the weakness.
Catastrophic backtracking: This term is used to describe the behavior of the regular expression as a negative technical impact.

## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.

### Extended Description


While assertion is good for catching logic errors and reducing the chances of reaching more serious vulnerability conditions, it can still lead to a denial of service.


For example, if a server handles multiple simultaneous connections, and an assert() occurs in one single connection that causes all other connections to be dropped, this is a reachable assertion that leads to a denial of service.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** While there is some overlap with allowlist/denylist problems, this entry is intended to deal with incorrectly written regular expressions, regardless of their intended use. Not every regular expression is intended for use as an allowlist or denylist. In addition, allowlists and denylists can be implemented using other mechanisms besides regular expressions.

**[Research Gap]** Regexp errors are likely a primary factor in many MFVs, especially those that require multiple manipulations to exploit. However, they are rarely diagnosed at this level of detail.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-2109:** Regexp isn't "anchored" to the beginning or end, which allows spoofed values that have trusted values as substrings.
- **CVE-2005-1949:** Regexp for IP address isn't anchored at the end, allowing appending of shell metacharacters.
- **CVE-2001-1072:** Bypass access restrictions via multiple leading slash, which causes a regular expression to fail.




## CWE-158: Improper Neutralization of Null Byte or NUL Character
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes NUL characters or null bytes when they are sent to a downstream component.

### Extended Description
As data is parsed, an injected NUL character or null byte may cause the product to believe the input is terminated earlier than it actually is, or otherwise cause the input to be misinterpreted. This could then be used to inject potentially dangerous input that occurs after the null byte or otherwise bypass validation routines and other protection mechanisms.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-138

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be a factor in multiple interpretation errors, other interaction errors, filename equivalence, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2008-1284:** NUL byte in theme name causes directory traversal impact to be worse
- **CVE-2005-2008:** Source code disclosure using trailing null.
- **CVE-2005-3293:** Source code disclosure using trailing null.




## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.

### Extended Description


 HTTP agents or components may include a web server, load balancer, reverse proxy, web caching proxy, application firewall, web browser, etc. Regardless of the role, they are expected to maintain coherent, consistent HTTP communication state across all components. However, including unexpected data in an HTTP header allows an attacker to specify the entirety of the HTTP message that is rendered by the client HTTP agent (e.g., web browser) or back-end HTTP agent (e.g., web server), whether the message is part of a request or a response. 


When an HTTP request contains unexpected CR and LF characters, the server may respond with an output stream that is interpreted as "splitting" the stream into two different HTTP messages instead of one. CR is carriage return, also given by %0d or \r, and LF is line feed, also given by %0a or \n.


In addition to CR and LF characters, other valid/RFC compliant special characters and unique character encodings can be utilized, such as HT (horizontal tab, also given by %09 or \t) and SP (space, also given as + sign or %20).


These types of unvalidated and unexpected data in HTTP message headers allow an attacker to control the second "split" message to mount attacks such as server-side request forgery, cross-site scripting, and cache poisoning attacks.


HTTP response splitting weaknesses may be present when:


  1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request.

  1. The data is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web user without neutralizing malicious characters that can be interpreted as separator characters for headers.

- **CVE-2018-12116:** Javascript-based framework allows request splitting through a path option of an HTTP request




## CWE-182: Collapse of Data into Unsafe Value
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

**[Relationship]** Overlaps regular expressions, although an implementation might not necessarily use regexp's.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2004-0815:** "/.////" in pathname collapses to absolute path.
- **CVE-2005-3123:** "/.//..//////././" is collapsed into "/.././" after ".." and "//" sequences are removed.
- **CVE-2002-0325:** ".../...//" collapsed to "..." due to removal of "./" in web server.




## CWE-777: Regular Expression without Anchors
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a regular expression to perform neutralization, but the regular expression is not anchored and may allow malicious or malformed data to slip through.

### Extended Description
When performing tasks such as validating against a set of allowed inputs (allowlist), data is examined and possibly modified to ensure that it is well-formed and adheres to a list of safe values. If the regular expression is not anchored, malicious or malformed data may be included before or after any string matching the regular expression. The type of malicious data that is allowed will depend on the context of the application and which anchors are omitted from the regular expression.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-625

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).




## CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component that specifies attributes that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control modifications of attributes of the object prototype.

### Extended Description


By adding or modifying attributes of an object prototype, it is possible to create attributes that exist on every object, or replace critical attributes with malicious ones. This can be problematic if the product depends on existence or non-existence of certain attributes, or uses pre-defined attributes of object prototype (such as hasOwnProperty, toString or valueOf).


This weakness is usually exploited by using a special attribute of objects called proto, constructor or prototype. Such attributes give access to the object prototype. This weakness is often found in code that assigns object attributes based on user input, or merges or clones objects recursively.

- **CVE-2019-10744:** Prototype pollution by setting default values to object attributes recursively.
- **CVE-2019-11358:** Prototype pollution by merging objects recursively.




## CWE-186: Overly Restrictive Regular Expression
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A regular expression is overly restrictive, which prevents dangerous values from being detected.

### Extended Description
This weakness is not about regular expression complexity. Rather, it is about a regular expression that does not match all values that are intended. Consider the use of a regexp to identify acceptable values or to spot unwanted terms. An overly restrictive regexp misses some potentially security-relevant values leading to either false positives *or* false negatives, depending on how the regexp is being used within the code. Consider the expression /[0-8]/ where the intention was /[0-9]/. This expression is not "complex" but the value "9" is not matched when maybe the programmer planned to check for it.

### Alternative Terms

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Can overlap allowlist/denylist errors (CWE-183/CWE-184)



### Observed Examples
