The secondary CWE is CWE-121 **Stack-based Buffer Overflow**, which has a ChildOf relationship to CWE-787 **Out-of-bounds Write**. These relationships help clarify the nature of memory-related vulnerabilities and guide the selection of the most specific CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe121 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the processing of crafted XMT files. This leads to an **out-of-bounds** read vulnerability and a stack overflow issue. The final impact is information disclosure and code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability based on the description provided. The description explicitly mentions \"**out-of-bounds**\" issues. The retriever results also indicated CWE-125 **Out-of-bounds Read** as a strong candidate. The final decision was to map CWE-125 as the primary CWE and CWE-121 **Stack-based Buffer Overflow** as a secondary CWE.\n\nThe vulnerability description states, \"Bentley MicroStation and MicroStation-based applications may be affected by **out-of-bounds** and stack overflow issues when opening crafted XMT files. Exploiting these issues could lead to information disclosure and code execution.\"\n\nCWE-125 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level for mapping.\n\nRelevant CWE
