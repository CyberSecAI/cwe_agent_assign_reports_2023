## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the processing of crafted XMT files. This leads to an **out-of-bounds** read vulnerability and a stack overflow issue. The final impact is information disclosure and code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability based on the description provided. The description explicitly mentions "**out-of-bounds**" issues. The retriever results also indicated CWE-125 **Out-of-bounds Read** as a strong candidate. The final decision was to map CWE-125 as the primary CWE and CWE-121 **Stack-based Buffer Overflow** as a secondary CWE.

The vulnerability description states, "Bentley MicroStation and MicroStation-based applications may be affected by **out-of-bounds** and stack overflow issues when opening crafted XMT files. Exploiting these issues could lead to information disclosure and code execution."

CWE-125 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level for mapping.
