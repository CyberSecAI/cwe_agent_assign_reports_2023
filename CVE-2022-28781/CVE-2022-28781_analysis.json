It is related to several other CWEs through parent-child and chain relationships. It's a child of CWE-707 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command) and has peer relationships with CWE-345 (Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity). It can precede CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory), CWE-41 (Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence), CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component), CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), and CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling).\n\nCWE-285 **Improper Authorization** is a Class-level CWE and a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe707[\"CWE-707: Improper Neutralization\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe41[\"CWE-41: Path Equivalence\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Injection\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Resource Allocation\"]\n    \n    cwe20 -->|CHILDOF| cwe707\n    cwe20 -->|PEEROF| cwe345\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe22\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe41\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe74\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe770\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284,cwe707,cwe345,cwe22,cwe41,cwe74,cwe119,cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20), which allows attackers to launch arbitrary activities with system privilege. This can be viewed as a form of **improper authorization** (CWE-285) since the system is not properly checking if the caller has the necessary privileges to perform the action.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identifies **improper input validation** as the root cause. The description states: \"**Improper input validation** in Settings prior to SMR-May-2022 Release 1 allows attackers to launch arbitrary activity with system privilege. The patch adds proper validation logic to check the caller.\" This statement provides direct evidence of **improper input validation**.\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section reinforces this by stating: \"The vulnerability is due to **improper input validation** in the Settings application.\" and \"Improper input validation allows attackers to launch arbitrary activities with system privileges.\"\n\nCWE-20 is a Class-level CWE, and the mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available. However, in this case, the description specifically mentions **improper input validation** as the root cause, making CWE-20 the most appropriate primary CWE.\n\nCWE-285 **Improper Authorization** is considered a secondary CWE because the **improper input validation** leads to the ability to launch arbitrary activities with system privileges. This implies that the system is not correctly authorizing the caller before allowing the activity to be launched. While **improper input validation** is the direct cause, the impact is that it bypasses authorization checks.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity given the provided information. While more specific input validation CWEs exist (e.g., CWE-1284, CWE-1285), the general term **improper input validation** is explicitly used in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
