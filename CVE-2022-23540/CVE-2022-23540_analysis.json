CWE-327 is a related Class-level CWE representing the use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm which can contribute to the improper verification. The hierarchical relationship here is that CWE-347 is often caused by underlying cryptographic issues, but in this case the none algorithm is the issue and is not necessarily broken.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n\n    cwe347\n    cwe327\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe327 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of algorithm definition** in the `jwt.verify()` function, leading to **defaulting to the none algorithm for signature verification**, ultimately resulting in a **signature validation bypass**.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Lack of algorithm definition**\n  - **Weakness:** **Defaulting to the none algorithm**\n  - **Impact:** Signature validation bypass\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability description indicates a **lack of algorithm definition** which leads to the `jwt.verify()` function **defaulting to the none algorithm for signature verification**. This directly results in a **signature validation bypass**.\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this analysis. It clearly states the root cause as the `jwt.verify()` function defaulting to the \"none\" algorithm when no algorithm is specified. The weakness is described as both the **insecure default algorithm** and the **lack of explicit algorithm enforcement**.\n\nBased on this evidence, CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature) is the most appropriate primary CWE. It accurately reflects the core issue: the product does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data because it allows the \"none\" algorithm.\n\nCWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) is a secondary consideration. While the \"none\" algorithm isn't inherently \"broken\" in the traditional sense, its use in signature verification is certainly \"risky\" as it effectively disables signature validation.\n\nThe retriever results also support CWE-347 as the top match with a score of 1.094. CWE-327 is also listed with a score of 0.770.\n\nI am selecting CWE-347 as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the **improper verification of cryptographic signature**. The evidence explicitly states that the `jwt.verify()` function defaults to the \"none\" algorithm, which means no signature verification is performed.\nI considered CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) but they were less appropriate. The vulnerability isn't about failing to authenticate or authorize correctly, but specifically about bypassing the signature verification process.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
