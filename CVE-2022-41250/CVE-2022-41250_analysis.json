Its parent is CWE-285, Improper Authorization, which is a more general class. A related weakness is CWE-522, Insufficiently Protected Credentials, which can be a consequence of missing authorization.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events for this vulnerability is as follows:\n1.  **Missing Permission Check (CWE-862):** The application **fails to perform an authorization check**, allowing unauthorized access.\n2.  **Connect to Attacker-Specified Server:** Attackers can connect to a server they control.\n3.  **Capture Credentials:** Attackers can capture credentials stored in Jenkins, indicating **insufficient protection of credentials (CWE-522)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the **missing permission check** pointed towards an authorization issue. The description explicitly mentions a **missing permission check**, which aligns directly with **CWE-862 (Missing Authorization)**. The ability to capture credentials suggests a secondary issue related to how credentials are protected, leading to consideration of **CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials)**.\n\nThe evidence explicitly states: \"A **missing permission check** in Jenkins SCM HttpClient Plugin 1.5 and earlier allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified HTTP server using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.\"\n\nThe graph relationships and retriever results supported the selection of CWE-862 as the primary weakness. The retriever results also suggested CWE-522, as the attacker is able to capture the credentials stored in Jenkins.\n\nCWE-862 is chosen because the root cause is a **missing authorization** check, not an incorrect one. While CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) could be considered, CWE-862 is more specific and therefore preferred. The fact that credentials can be captured suggests CWE-522, but this is a consequence of the **missing authorization** check and not the primary issue. Both CWE-862 and CWE-522 are class-level, however, the guidance suggests a more specific Base level, but none of those fit.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community.
