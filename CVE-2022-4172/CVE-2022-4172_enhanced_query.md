# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-4172

# Vulnerability Description

    An **integer overflow** and **buffer overflow** issues were found in the ACPI Error Record Serialization Table (ERST) device of QEMU in the read_erst_record() and write_erst_record() functions. Both issues may allow the guest to overrun the host buffer allocated for the ERST memory device. A malicious guest could use these flaws to crash the QEMU process on the host.

    ## WEAKNESS: 'integer overflow'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 466.31)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...

### 2. CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read (Score: 401.39)

The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....

### 3. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 376.80)

The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties....

### 4. CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop') (Score: 374.17)

The product contains an iteration or loop with an exit condition that cannot be reached, i.e., an infinite loop....

### 5. CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value (Score: 365.62)
