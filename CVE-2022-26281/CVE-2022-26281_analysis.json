CWE-863 is a child of the broader CWE-284, Improper Access Control (Pillar). The decision to choose CWE-863 over CWE-284 is based on the increased specificity of CWE-863, as it directly addresses the **incorrect authorization** issue mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect access control** which leads to **incorrect authorization**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states an **incorrect access control** issue in BigAnt Server v5.6.06. The phrase \"**incorrect access control**\" is the primary indicator for CWE selection.\n\nThe initial assessment considered CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) due to the presence of \"**incorrect access control**\" in the description. However, CWE-284 is a high-level Pillar, and the mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available. The retriever results suggested CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) as a more specific alternative.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a Class-level CWE that directly addresses situations where authorization checks are not performed correctly. Given the \"**incorrect access control**\" phrasing, which implies a flaw in authorization logic, CWE-863 is a better fit than the more generic CWE-284.\n\nThe final decision to select CWE-863 is based on the following:\n\n1.  The vulnerability description specifically mentions \"**incorrect access control**.\"\n2.  CWE-863 directly addresses the issue of **incorrect authorization** checks.\n3.  CWE-863 is a Class-level CWE, providing a more specific classification than the Pillar-level CWE-284.\n4.  The mapping guidance for CWE-284 discourages its use when more specific alternatives are available.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision is the \"**incorrect access control**\" statement in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 7031.54\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 6587.03\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.",
