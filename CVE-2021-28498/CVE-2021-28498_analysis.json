CWE-522 is a child of CWE-1390 and CWE-287 and CWE-668. This shows a hierarchy where storing a password in plaintext (CWE-256) is a specific type of credential protection issue (CWE-522), which falls under broader categories of weak authentication and resource exposure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n    class cwe1390,cwe287,cwe668 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause** which is the **\"user enable passwords set in clear text\"**. This leads to the impact where **\"unprivileged users getting complete access to the systems\"**. The chain is:\n\n1.  **CWE-256:** Plaintext Storage of a Password (Root Cause)\n2.  **CWE-284:** Improper Access Control (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-256 as the primary weakness, with CWE-522 as a potential secondary candidate. The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference links strongly supports this assessment. The vulnerability description explicitly states \"**user enable passwords set in clear text**\", which directly aligns with the description of CWE-256: \"Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.\" The CVE reference links further confirm this by stating that \"**user account passwords or enable passwords set in clear text were stored in the running configuration**\".\n\nThe relationship analysis reinforces the selection of CWE-256. It is a base-level CWE, providing a specific description of the flaw. While CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is a parent class, CWE-256 offers a more precise characterization of the vulnerability. The mapping guidance for CWE-256 explicitly allows its usage and states that it is at the base level of abstraction which is preferred.\n\nBased on the evidence and relationship analysis, CWE-256 is the most appropriate CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
