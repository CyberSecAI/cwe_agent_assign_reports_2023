# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-36064

## Vulnerability Description
Shescape is a shell escape package for JavaScript. An Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity vulnerability impacts users that use Shescape to escape arguments for the Unix shells `Bash` and `Dash`, or any not-officially-supported Unix shell and/or using the `escape` or `escapeAll` functions with the `interpolation` option set to `true`. An attacker can cause polynomial backtracking or quadratic runtime in terms of the input string length due to two Regular Expressions in Shescape that are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). This bug has been patched in v1.5.10. For `Dash` only, this bug has been patched since v1.5.9. As a workaround, a maximum length can be enforced on input strings to Shescape to reduce the impact of the vulnerability. It is not recommended to try and detect vulnerable input strings, as the logic for this may end up being vulnerable to ReDoS itself.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **inefficient regular expression**
- **weakness:** **regular expression denial of service**
- **impact:** quadratic runtime
- **product:** Shescape
- **version:** before 1.5.9
- **component:** escape and escapeAll functions

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36064:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from inefficient regular expressions used in the `shescape` library when escaping arguments for Unix shells (Bash and Dash) with the `interpolation` option set to `true`. Specifically, two regular expressions are susceptible to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Polynomial backtracking:** One of the regular expressions used for escaping is vulnerable to polynomial backtracking, where specific input strings can cause the regex engine to take an excessive amount of time to process, leading to performance issues.
- **Quadratic runtime:** Another regular expression can exhibit quadratic runtime complexity, meaning the processing time grows quadratically with the input string length, causing the program to slow down significantly or even become unresponsive.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to cause a denial-of-service by providing specially crafted input strings to the `shescape.escape` or `shescape.escapeAll` functions. This will cause the program to be slow or unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Input manipulation: The vulnerability is triggered by crafting specific input strings, for example, using repeated characters such as `{`, `:`, or `,`, combined with other characters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the input strings that are passed to the `shescape.escape` or `shescape.escapeAll` functions with the `interpolation` option set to `true` and targeted towards Bash or Dash shells or any not-officially-supported shell.
- No specific position is required, but the attacker needs to be able to supply the vulnerable input to the shescape library functions.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to the Bash and Dash shells or any not-officially-supported shell, and when using the `escape` or `escapeAll` function with the `interpolation` option set to `true`.
- The issue was resolved by modifying the regular expressions to avoid polynomial backtracking and quadratic runtime.
- The vulnerability was patched in versions 1.5.10 (and 1.5.9 for Dash only) of `shescape`.
- As a workaround, users can enforce maximum length on the input strings, but detecting vulnerable strings is not recommended since it could introduce additional vulnerabilities.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-1333 (Regular Expression Denial of Service).

The provided content gives more detailed information about the specific regular expressions and how they were fixed.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.

### Extended Description
Some regular expression engines have a feature called "backtracking". If the token cannot match, the engine "backtracks" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.
 Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:


  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.

  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.

  - The input can be long enough.

 Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. 

### Alternative Terms
ReDoS: ReDoS is an abbreviation of "Regular expression Denial of Service".
Regular Expression Denial of Service: While this term is attack-focused, this is commonly used to describe the weakness.
Catastrophic backtracking: This term is used to describe the behavior of the regular expression as a negative technical impact.

## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component
in another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the
intended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.

### Extended Description


When creating commands using interpolation into a string, developers may assume that only the arguments/options that they specify will be processed. This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

### Extended Description


Improper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.


Most products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" is a structured message containing a command ("GET") with a single argument ("/index.html") and metadata about which protocol version is being used ("HTTP/1.1").


If an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.

**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness is primary to all weaknesses related to injection (CWE-74) since the inherent nature of injection involves the violation of structured messages.

**[Relationship]** 

CWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.


However, input validation is not always sufficient, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a last name is inserted into a query. The name "O'Reilly" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the "'" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise neutralized. In this case, stripping the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.


**[Terminology]** The usage of the "encoding" and "escaping" terms varies widely. For example, in some programming languages, the terms are used interchangeably, while other languages provide APIs that use both terms for different tasks. This overlapping usage extends to the Web, such as the "escape" JavaScript function whose purpose is stated to be encoding. The concepts of encoding and escaping predate the Web by decades. Given such a context, it is difficult for CWE to adopt a consistent vocabulary that will not be misinterpreted by some constituency.

**[Theoretical]** This is a data/directive boundary error in which data boundaries are not sufficiently enforced before it is sent to a different control sphere.

**[Research Gap]** While many published vulnerabilities are related to insufficient output encoding, there is such an emphasis on input validation as a protection mechanism that the underlying causes are rarely described. Within CVE, the focus is primarily on well-understood issues like cross-site scripting and SQL injection. It is likely that this weakness frequently occurs in custom protocols that support multiple encodings, which are not necessarily detectable with automated techniques.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-41232:** Chain: authentication routine in Go-based agile development product does not escape user name (CWE-116), allowing LDAP injection (CWE-90)
- **CVE-2008-4636:** OS command injection in backup software using shell metacharacters in a filename; correct behavior would require that this filename could not be changed.
- **CVE-2008-0769:** Web application does not set the charset when sending a page to a browser, allowing for XSS exploitation when a browser chooses an unexpected encoding.
