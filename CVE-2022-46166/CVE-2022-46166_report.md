## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-917 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-94 | Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') | 0.7 | Base | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-917, which is a Base level CWE that focuses on the **improper neutralization of special elements in an expression language statement**. It has a parent relationship with CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) and a peer relationship with CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine). CWE-94 is a possible secondary CWE, and is a parent of CWE-1336. The base level of abstraction is preferred because it accurately represents the root cause of the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with the **improper neutralization of special elements used in an expression language statement** (CWE-917), which leads to arbitrary code execution. The ability to modify environment variables via the UI exacerbates the SpEL injection vulnerability.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided evidence, which includes the vulnerability description, key phrases, and CVE reference links content summary. The vulnerability stems from the usage of Spring Expression Language (SpEL) in the notification feature of Spring Boot Admin. Specifically, the application was using `StandardEvaluationContext` which allowed for arbitrary code execution through SpEL injection.

The primary CWE is CWE-917 because the application was vulnerable to SpEL injection, where an attacker could inject malicious SpEL expressions into the notification templates. These expressions, when evaluated, can execute arbitrary code on the server.

CWE-94 was considered as a secondary option because the **SpEL injection** can lead to arbitrary code execution, the **improper neutralization** is the root cause, making CWE-917 the more accurate primary classification.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.
## CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an externally controlled name or reference that resolves to a resource that is outside of the intended control sphere.
## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.
## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.
## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.
## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.
## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.
## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.
