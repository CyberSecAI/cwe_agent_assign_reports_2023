## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** of the BigPanda Notifier Plugin **storing the BigPanda API key unencrypted in its global configuration file**. This leads to the **impact** where users with access to the Jenkins controller file system can view the API key. The root cause is the **improper storage** of the API key, directly leading to the exposure of sensitive information.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis strongly supports the selection of CWE-260 (Password in Configuration File) as the primary CWE. The vulnerability description clearly states that the BigPanda API key is stored unencrypted in the global configuration file, which directly aligns with the definition of CWE-260. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" reinforces this by stating that the "API key is stored in plain text." This direct evidence justifies the high confidence level. CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) and CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) were considered as secondary CWEs due to their broader scope, but CWE-260 was chosen for its precise match to the vulnerability's specifics.

The selection of CWE-260 is also supported by the MITRE mapping guidance, which recommends using Base level CWEs when possible. The retriever results also indicate CWE-260 as the top candidate.

CWE-538 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory) and CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) were considered but not selected because they are less specific than CWE-260. The issue isn't just about putting sensitive info into an accessible file, but specifically about a password/API key within a configuration file.

### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

### Extended Description


Because the information is stored in cleartext (i.e., unencrypted), attackers could potentially read it. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.


When organizations adopt cloud services, it can be easier for attackers to access the data from anywhere on the Internet.


In some systems/environments such as cloud, the use of "double encryption" (at both the software and hardware layer) might be required, and the developer might be solely responsible for both layers, instead of shared responsibility with the administrator of the broader system/environment.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** Different people use "cleartext" and "plaintext" to mean the same thing: the lack of encryption. However, within cryptography, these have more precise meanings. Plaintext is the information just before it is fed into a cryptographic algorithm, including already-encrypted text. Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-readable (such as base64 encoding).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30275:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.
- **CVE-2009-2272:** password and username stored in cleartext in a cookie
- **CVE-2009-1466:** password stored in cleartext in a file with insecure permissions
