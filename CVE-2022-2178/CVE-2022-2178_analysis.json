CWE-80, a variant of CWE-79, focuses on improper neutralization of script-related HTML tags. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"Cross-site Scripting (XSS)\" and \"**improper input neutralization**\", aligning directly with CWE-79. The description doesn't provide enough specific detail to definitively say the XSS is specifically related to script-related HTML tags, but it is possible. Therefore, CWE-80 is a reasonable, but less confident, secondary classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe80[\"CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\"]\n    \n    cwe80 -->|ChildOf| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe80 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of user-supplied input. This **weakness** leads to the possibility of injecting malicious scripts into web pages served to other users, resulting in Cross-Site Scripting.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identifies CWE-79 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of Cross-Site Scripting and **improper input neutralization** in the vulnerability description. The retriever results also support this classification, with CWE-79 having the highest relevance score.\n\nThe selection of CWE-79 is based on the following evidence from the vulnerability description:\n\n*   \"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-site Scripting) vulnerability...\"\n*   \"**rootcause: improper input neutralization**\"\n*   \"**weakness: cross-site scripting**\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision to include CWE-80 as a secondary candidate. While the description does not explicitly mention HTML tags, the possibility exists, making CWE-80 a plausible, albeit less certain, classification.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-79 represents the general class of XSS vulnerabilities, while CWE-80 offers a more specific variant related to HTML tags. Since the evidence does not definitively point to HTML tags, CWE-79 remains the primary classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 7567.82\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
