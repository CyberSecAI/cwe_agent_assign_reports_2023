CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is a Class-level CWE that encompasses a broader range of credential protection issues, and has multiple base-level children including CWE-257 (Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format) and CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe316[\"CWE-316: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe922[\"CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe257[\"CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n\n    cwe316 -->|CHILDOF| cwe312\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe922\n    cwe257 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe316 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n    class cwe312,cwe311,cwe922,cwe257,cwe256 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient protection of credentials**, specifically storing them in **cleartext in memory**. This allows an attacker with debug privileges to perform a process dump and **retrieve the stored credentials**, potentially leading to the **compromise of customer networks**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **Insufficiently Protected Credentials** (**WEAKNESS**) aspect of the vulnerability, as highlighted in the vulnerability description. However, the detailed information from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary provides a clearer picture of the root cause: the Nessus scanner stores policy credentials in **cleartext within the `nessusd` process memory** (**ROOT CAUSE**). This evidence strongly supports classifying the vulnerability as **CWE-316: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory**.\n\nThe retriever results also point towards CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) and CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials). While CWE-522 captures the general problem, CWE-316 is more specific about where the sensitive information is stored (memory) and in what format (cleartext). Therefore, CWE-316 is a more precise classification. CWE-312 is a good fit, but since the information is in memory, CWE-316 is a better fit.\n\nThe decision to prioritize CWE-316 is based on the following evidence:\n\n*   \"Root cause of vulnerability: The Nessus scanner stores policy credentials in cleartext within the `nessusd` process memory.\"\n*   The description of CWE-316: \"The product stores sensitive information in cleartext in memory.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-316 aligns with MITRE's guidance to choose the most specific CWE that accurately represents the vulnerability and is at the Base or Variant level of abstraction.\n\nCWEs Considered But Not Used:\n\n*   CWE-522: While initially considered due to the \"Insufficiently Protected Credentials\" phrasing, it's a broader class. The vulnerability is more precisely described by the cleartext storage in memory.\n*   CWE-312: This is a parent of CWE-316 and a good fit, but since the vulnerability is specifically about storage in memory, CWE-316 is more accurate.\n*   CWE-257 and CWE-256: These are related to password storage, but the issue isn't just passwords; it's any sensitive credential. The cleartext storage is the core issue.\n*   CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File. This CWE relates to log files, and the vulnerability is about information stored in memory, so it is not a good fit.",
