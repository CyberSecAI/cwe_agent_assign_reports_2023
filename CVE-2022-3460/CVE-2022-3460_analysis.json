This aligns with the vulnerability's root cause: **failure to properly handle or mask sensitive variables**. CWE-201, a secondary consideration, addresses the **insertion of sensitive information into sent data**, reflecting the actual exposure of unmasked variables. CWE-522, at the class level, broadly covers **insufficiently protected credentials**, which is a relevant but less specific aspect of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe669[\"CWE-669: Incorrect Behavior Order\"]\n    \n    cwe212 -->|CHILDOF| cwe669\n    cwe201 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe212\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe212 primary\n    class cwe201,cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **improper handling of sensitive variables** (**ROOTCAUSE**), leading to the **exposure of these variables in plain text** within the variable preview feature (**WEAKNESS**). This culminates in the potential **unauthorized access to sensitive information** like passwords and API keys (**IMPACT**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference summary. The root cause, as explicitly stated, involves **improper handling of sensitive variables leading to exposure**. This directly corresponds to **CWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer)**, which focuses on the failure to remove sensitive data before making it available to unauthorized actors.\n\nThe vulnerability description key phrases emphasize that sensitive variables become \"unmasked when viewed in variable preview,\" supporting **CWE-212**. The CVE reference summary highlights \"Information Exposure\" and \"Clear-text Storage of Sensitive Values\" as key vulnerabilities, further solidifying the relevance of **CWE-212**.\n\nThe retriever results list **CWE-212** as the top combined result, adding further weight to its selection. The mapping guidance for **CWE-212** allows its usage and indicates that it is at the base level of abstraction, a preferred level.\n\nWhile **CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data)** and **CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials)** were considered, they are less specific than **CWE-212**. **CWE-201** describes the act of sending sensitive data, while **CWE-212** focuses on the root cause of not removing the sensitive data in the first place. **CWE-522** is a more general class covering credential protection issues.\n\nTherefore, **CWE-212** is the most appropriate CWE because it directly addresses the **root cause of the vulnerability** and is at the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
