CWE-113 also has a ChildOf relationship with CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) and CWE-436 (Interpretation Conflict). These relationships highlight that the core issue stems from **improper input sanitization** leading to the potential for HTTP Request/Response Splitting. While CWE-20 is a parent, CWE-113 provides a more specific classification aligning with the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe436[\"CWE-436: Interpretation Conflict\"]\n\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe93\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe436\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe113 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n    class cwe93,cwe436 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **improper input sanitization**. This allows an attacker to supply invalid input to the iLO 4 webserver, leading to a **remote host header injection**. The final impact is that the webserver responds with a redirect to an attacker-controlled domain.\n\nImproper Input Sanitization -> Remote Host Header Injection -> Redirect to Attacker-Controlled Domain\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-113 as the primary candidate based on the **weakness** being a **remote host header injection** and the **rootcause** of **improper input sanitization**. The vulnerability description clearly indicates that the iLO 4 webserver does not properly neutralize CRLF sequences in HTTP headers, leading to the possibility of HTTP Request/Response Splitting. This directly aligns with the description of CWE-113.\n\nThe retriever results also support this assessment, with CWE-113 appearing as a relevant candidate. CWE-74 and CWE-79 were considered but deemed less specific. CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) was considered as a secondary weakness since it is a broader classification that encompasses the **improper input sanitization**, but CWE-113 more precisely describes the specific type of **improper neutralization** occurring.\n\nThe relationships outlined in the relationship analysis section also influenced the final selection, reinforcing the connection between **improper input sanitization** and the resulting HTTP Request/Response Splitting.\n\nBased on the available evidence and the relationship analysis, CWE-113 is the optimal choice for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.388\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input or data, but it does\n        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the\n        properties that are required to process the data safely and\n        correctly.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n\n### Detailed Analysis of Selected CWEs:\n\n*   **CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')**\n    *   **Match:** The vulnerability description specifically mentions the possibility of supplying invalid input causing a redirect, which aligns with the impact of CWE-113.\n    *   **Explanation:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject CRLF sequences into HTTP headers, potentially leading to the server misinterpreting the HTTP stream and redirecting users to an attacker-controlled domain. This matches the extended description of CWE-113, which discusses how unexpected data in HTTP headers can lead to attacks such as server-side request forgery and cache poisoning.\n    *   **Relationships:** CWE-113 is a variant, making it a more specific choice than its parent classes.\n    *   **Guidance:** The mapping guidance recommends using the variant level of abstraction, which supports this selection.\n\n*   **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**\n    *   **Match:** The vulnerability stems from **improper input sanitization**, which is a form of **improper input validation**.\n    *   **Explanation:** While CWE-20 is a broader category, the root cause of the vulnerability lies in the iLO 4 webserver's failure to adequately validate and sanitize input before including it in HTTP headers.\n    *   **Relationships:** CWE-20 is a class and a parent to CWE-113.\n    *   **Guidance:** The mapping guidance discourages using CWE-20 when more specific CWEs are available, but it is still a valid secondary consideration as it represents the general class of error.\n\n### CWEs Considered But Not Used:\n\n*   **CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')** - While this could be considered, it's too broad. The vulnerability is more specifically related to CRLF injection in HTTP headers, making CWE-113 a better fit.\n*   **CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')** - This CWE relates to Cross-site Scripting vulnerabilities. The described vulnerability focuses on HTTP header manipulation for redirection, not script injection into web pages, making CWE-113 a more appropriate selection.\n*   **CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')** - The vulnerability does not involve OS command injection, making this CWE irrelevant.\n*   **CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input** - This CWE is about validating quantities, which is not relevant to this vulnerability.\n\nThe final decision to prioritize CWE-113 is primarily based on the specific description of the vulnerability involving **remote host header injection** due to **improper input sanitization**, aligning perfectly with the characteristics of HTTP Request/Response Splitting.",
