CWE-257 (Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format) is a peer of CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password), both relating to credential management. The choice of CWE-321 is based on the specific detail of a hard-coded cryptographic key being used.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe257[\"CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe257 -->|PEEROF| cwe259\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe321 primary\n    class cwe798,cwe257,cwe259 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a universal and recoverable encryption key** (CWE-321 or CWE-798). This leads to the impact where an attacker can recover the credentials that were used, which is a form of **storing passwords in a recoverable format** (CWE-257). The root cause is the **use of a weak key**, and the impact is the **exposure of credentials**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **use of a universal and recoverable encryption key**. The evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that \"RunAsSpc version 4.0 uses a universal encryption key for encrypting files, meaning the key is the same across all installations.\" This directly supports the selection of CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) as the primary weakness. CWE-321 is a Variant, which is more specific than its parent CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials).\n\nCWE-257 (Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format) was considered because the impact of the vulnerability is that an attacker can recover credentials. While technically correct, it's more of a consequence of the root cause, rather than the root cause itself.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision to choose CWE-321 over CWE-798 because CWE-321 is a child of CWE-798, providing a more specific classification.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the weakness based on the evidence provided. CWE-321 specifically addresses the **use of a hard-coded cryptographic key**, which is the core issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users.
