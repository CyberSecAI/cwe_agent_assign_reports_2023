The vulnerability focuses specifically on the **insufficient computational effort** in the password hashing, making CWE-916 a more precise and appropriate choice. CWE-200 was considered but deemed less specific as it represents a broader category of information exposure, while the core issue here is the weak password hashing algorithm.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe328\n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe916 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause** of using a **low iteration count for PBKDF2 derived key** (CWE-916). This leads to the impact where an attacker with user profile access can **retrieve stored password hashes** and then successfully **perform an offline cracking attack** to recover plaintext passwords of other users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identified CWE-916 as the primary weakness. The analysis is based on the vulnerability description, specifically the key phrase \"**low iteration count for PBKDF2 derived key**\" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary stating: \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of password hash with insufficient computational effort (CWE-916).\" The graph relationships reinforced this decision by highlighting the specific nature of the weakness in password hashing. The selection of CWE-916 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately describes the technical flaw (insufficient computational effort) rather than the broader impact (information exposure). Other CWEs were considered, particularly CWE-200, but were rejected due to their broader scope and less precise fit for the described vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-834: Excessive Iteration\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an iteration or loop without sufficiently limiting the number of times that the loop is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
