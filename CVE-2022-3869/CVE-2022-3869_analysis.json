CWE-79 is a specific type of injection that occurs during web page generation. CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) is another child of CWE-94 (Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\"]\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n\n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe1336 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper input sanitization** of user-supplied email addresses. This leads to **improper neutralization** when the email is inserted into an error message using `str_replace`. The final impact is the **potential injection of malicious HTML code**, which can result in XSS attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which indicates a **code injection** vulnerability in froxlor/froxlor. The root cause is the **failure to properly sanitize** user-provided email addresses before including them in error messages. The `CVE Reference Links Content Summary` section states: \"The core weakness is the **lack of proper input sanitization** before including user-provided data within output displayed to the user. Specifically the code was using `str_replace` to include an email in a string without escaping it first. This allows for a malicious email address to inject HTML.\"\n\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')). This is because the vulnerability involves injecting malicious HTML into a web page served to users. This aligns with the description of CWE-79, which states: \"The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\" The CWE for similar CVE Descriptions also lists CWE-79 as the Primary CWE Match.\n\nCWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) was considered, because the vulnerability is fixed by removing user input from the error message, this could involve a template of some kind. But the evidence suggests the error was in the `str_replace` without template escaping, so CWE-79 is more accurate.\n\nThe final selection is at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-79 is a Base-level CWE that directly addresses the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Technical Explanation:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input (email addresses) before including it in the HTML output (error messages). This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML code, leading to XSS.\n\n**Security Implications:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts that can steal user cookies, redirect users to phishing sites, or perform other malicious actions in the context of the user's session.\n\n**Parent-Child Relationships:** CWE-79 is a child of CWE-74, which is a more general class of injection vulnerabilities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance Influence:** The MITRE mapping guidance recommends using Base-level CWEs, and CWE-79 is a Base-level CWE that accurately describes the vulnerability.\n\n**Confidence:** 1\n\n## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\n**Technical Explanation:** If a template engine were used, the application would fail to neutralize special elements in user input before processing it with the template engine, leading to code injection.\n\n**Security Implications:** This could allow attackers to inject template expressions that execute arbitrary code or modify the generated output.\n\n**Parent-Child Relationships:** CWE-1336 is a child of CWE-94, which is a class of weaknesses related to code injection.\n\n**Mapping Guidance Influence:** The MITRE mapping guidance recommends using Base-level CWEs, and CWE-1336 is a Base-level CWE, but it is not the primary cause.\n\n**Confidence:** 0.6",
