The retriever results suggested several potential child CWEs, but the provided vulnerability description lacks the detail to choose one over the other.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe20 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Input Validation**, leading to a nearby crash. The provided information does not give further detail about the crash.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **Improper Input Validation** as the root cause of the vulnerability, as stated in the vulnerability description key phrases. The vulnerability description mentions a nearby crash as the impact of the vulnerability.\n\nThe retriever results listed CWE-20 as the top CWE match. However, CWE-20 is a Class-level CWE and the mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available. The retriever results also suggested other more specific CWEs related to input validation, such as CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input), CWE-1285 (Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input), and CWE-1286 (Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input). However, the vulnerability description lacks the necessary details to determine which of these CWEs, if any, are a better fit than CWE-20. Without knowing the specifics of the input that is not being properly validated, it's impossible to select a more specific CWE with confidence.\n\nTherefore, I am assigning CWE-20 as the primary CWE, but with a lower confidence score of 0.7, acknowledging that it is a general classification and a more specific CWE might be more appropriate if more information were available.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives a complex input with multiple elements or fields that must be consistent with each other, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually consistent.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n## CWE-1389: Incorrect Parsing of Numbers with Different Radices\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product parses numeric input assuming base 10 (decimal) values, but it does not account for inputs that use a different base number (radix).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-606: Unchecked Input for Loop Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly check inputs that are used for loop conditions, potentially leading to a denial of service or other consequences because of excessive looping.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.

In many cases, lower-level children or descendants are more appropriate. However, sometimes this weakness is forced to be used due to the lack of in-depth weakness research.

This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation.
