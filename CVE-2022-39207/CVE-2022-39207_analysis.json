CWE-79 is a base-level CWE, which is appropriate for the given vulnerability description. CWE-79 has a parent-child relationship with CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')), but CWE-79 is a more specific and better fit than CWE-74.\nCWE-613 (Insufficient Session Expiration) is also considered due to the vulnerability description indicating that cookies lack the HttpOnly flag, which allows session hijacking. CWE-613 is a base-level CWE, but the evidence is weak and the cookies lacking HttpOnly doesn't directly lead to session hijacking. It only assists if there is an XSS vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe613[\"CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe79 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe613\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe613 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of restrictions on accessing artifact files**. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML into a build artifact. When a user accesses this artifact, the browser executes the malicious HTML, leading to **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** (CWE-79). Because cookies do not set the HttpOnly flag, it facilitates the attacker to steal the session cookie, but it requires the XSS to be in place first. The final impact is privilege escalation and potentially remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-79 as the primary weakness due to the presence of a persistent XSS vulnerability. The vulnerability description states: \"This leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when a user creates a build artifact that contains HTML. When accessing the artifact, the content is rendered by the browser, including any JavaScript that it contains.\" This directly aligns with the description of CWE-79: \"The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\"\n\nThe retriever results also supports this selection, with CWE-79 having the highest score.\n\nCWE-613 was considered as a secondary weakness because \"all cookies (except for the rememberMe one) do not set the HttpOnly flag, an attacker could steal the session of a victim and use it to impersonate them\". However, this is a secondary issue that facilitates the XSS attack, but does not directly cause it. The vulnerability description indicates that the primary issue is the lack of proper sanitization of build artifact files.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-79 is a base-level CWE that accurately represents the XSS vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
