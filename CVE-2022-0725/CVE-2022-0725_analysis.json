The secondary CWE is CWE-312, addressing the **storage of sensitive information in cleartext**. The relationship here is that **logging plain text passwords** is a form of **cleartext storage** within a log file. CWE-532 is a child of CWE-200 (Information Exposure), emphasizing the impact of this vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n    cwe538[\"CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\"]\n    \n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe538\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe922\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe312 secondary\n    class cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with the **root cause** of the application **logging the plain text passwords in system log**, leading to the weakness of **sensitive information being stored in cleartext in a log file**, and finally resulting in the **impact** of **information exposure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference. The key phrase \" **logging the plain text passwords in system log**\" directly points to CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further confirms this by stating \"KeePass **logging plain text passwords** to the system log when clearing the clipboard\".\n\nThe relationship graph influenced the selection by highlighting the connection between CWE-532 and its parent CWE-200 (Information Exposure), reinforcing the impact of the vulnerability. CWE-312 was considered as a secondary weakness because logging plaintext passwords inherently involves storing them in cleartext, although the primary issue is the logging action itself.\n\nCWE-532 is selected at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately describes the vulnerability of logging sensitive information to a log file. The retriever results also support this decision, with CWE-532 being the top-ranked CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially
