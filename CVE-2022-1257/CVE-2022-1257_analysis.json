It is a child of CWE-311 **[Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data]** and CWE-922 **[Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information]**. CWE-922 is a Class level CWE, making CWE-312 more specific. CWE-311 is discouraged because it is high-level and has more precise children available.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe922[\"CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe922\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe311,cwe922 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insecure storage of sensitive information**. The sensitive information is stored in `ma.db`. A local user can then **gain access to sensitive information** because it is not properly protected. The fix was to move the sensitive information to encrypted database files.\n- **Root Cause:** **Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information** (CWE-312)\n- **Impact:** Gain access to sensitive information\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states \"**insecure storage of sensitive information**\" which directly relates to the core problem. The vulnerability description key phrases also include \"**rootcause: insecure storage of sensitive information**\". This leads to a local user gaining access to sensitive information, highlighting a confidentiality breach. The retriever results also indicate that CWE-922 **[Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information]** and CWE-312 **[Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information]** are the top candidates.\n\nCWE-922 **[Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information]** is a class-level CWE, while CWE-312 **[Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information]** is a base-level CWE. Given that the fix moved the sensitive information to encrypted database files, the data was likely stored in cleartext before the fix. Therefore, CWE-312 **[Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information]** is the more appropriate and specific CWE. While CWE-922 is a valid candidate, it is less specific.\n\nCWE-311 **[Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data]** was also considered, but it is a class-level CWE and is discouraged when more specific children like CWE-312 are available. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-312 is a child of both CWE-311 and CWE-922, solidifying its position as the most accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nThe final decision to select CWE-312 is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description, the retriever results, and the hierarchical relationships between the candidate CWEs, making it the most specific and appropriate choice.",
