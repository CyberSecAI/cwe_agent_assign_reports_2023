# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2022-34487

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-425 | Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |
| CWE-471 | Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID) | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), which is a Class-level CWE. CWE-425 (Direct Request) is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-862, making it a more specific candidate if the evidence supports it. CWE-471 (Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data) is another Base-level CWE that could be relevant if the plugin relies on assumed-immutable data for authorization. The decision to include CWE-425 and CWE-471 is based on the specific vulnerability details and the relationships between the CWEs.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of weaknesses starts with the **lack of proper access control**, leading to the ability for unauthenticated users to modify settings. This can be represented as:

**Missing Authorization** (CWE-862) -> **Direct Request** (CWE-425) / **Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data** (CWE-471) -> **Arbitrary Option Update** (Impact).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified **Broken Access Control** as the primary issue, leading to the selection of CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) as the primary CWE. The vulnerability description clearly states that the plugin fails to properly restrict access to its settings, allowing unauthenticated users to make changes.

The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section supports this by stating: "The vulnerability stems from a **lack of proper access control** in the Shortcode Addons WordPress plugin, allowing unauthorized users to modify settings."

CWE-425 (Direct Request) was considered because the vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to directly modify settings, bypassing the intended access controls.
CWE-471 (Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data) was considered because the plugin might be relying on assumed-immutable data for authorization decisions, which is then being modified by unauthorized users.

The choice of CWE-862 as primary, with CWE-425 and CWE-471 as secondary, provides a more detailed representation of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-424: Improper Protection of Alternate Path
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently protect all possible paths that a user can take to access restricted functionality or resources.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 5558.53
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This
