This is a variant-level CWE, providing a specific description of the vulnerability. CWE-416 is a child of CWE-825 (**Expired Pointer Dereference**) and CWE-672 (**Operation on a Resource after Expiration**), indicating a more general class of issues related to resource management. The `CanPrecede` relationships to CWE-120 (**Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')**) and CWE-123 (**Write-what-where Condition**).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on a Resource after Expiration\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n    \n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe416 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe120\n    cwe416 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe123\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe825,cwe672,cwe120,cwe123 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **Use after free** (CWE-416) in the Permissions API, leading to potential heap corruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which includes a clear statement of the root cause as **\"Use after free\"**.
