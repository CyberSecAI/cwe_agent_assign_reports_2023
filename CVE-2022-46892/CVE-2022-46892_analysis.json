CWE-1220 (Insufficient Granularity of Access Control) and CWE-280 (Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges) are considered as secondary CWEs due to their base-level abstraction and relevance to the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe1220[\"CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\"]\n    cwe280[\"CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe1220 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe280 -->|CHILDOF| cwe755\n    cwe284 -->|PARENT OF| cwe863\n    cwe284 -->|PARENT OF| cwe1220\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe1220,cwe280 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access controls**, leading to the ability of the OS to reinitialize a disabled root complex.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Improper Access Controls**\n  - **Weakness:** Ability of OS to reinitialize a disabled root complex by modifying the DSDT ACPI table.\n  - **Impact:** Re-enabling root ports which may provide unintended access depending on the platform configuration, leading to unauthorized access or compromise of system integrity.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **improper access controls** identified in the vulnerability description. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary provided further evidence, highlighting the OS's ability to overwrite the DSDT ACPI table and reinitialize the Root Complex.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) aligns with the **improper access control** issue, where the OS is incorrectly authorized to perform an action (reinitializing the root complex) that it should not be able to do. The mapping guidance suggests that CWE-863 is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate; however, in this case, the action of reinitializing the root complex after it has been disabled signifies an authorization failure.\n\nCWE-1220 (Insufficient Granularity of Access Control) is relevant because the access controls are not granular enough to prevent the OS from reinitializing the root complex. This implies a lack of fine-grained control over which entities can modify the DSDT ACPI table.\n\nCWE-280 (Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges) is considered because the vulnerability involves the OS being able to perform an action (reinitializing the root complex) despite the intent to disable it.\n\nThe selection of CWE-863 as the primary CWE is based on the evidence that the **improper access controls** directly result in an authorization failure. The additional CWEs provide further context and detail about the nature of the access control weaknesses.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
