While CWE-200 is a broader class, the specific weakness is better captured by the cleartext storage family. CWE-317 is a variant of CWE-312 and is more specific.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe317[\"CWE-317: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in GUI\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe317 -->|CHILDOF| cwe312\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe317 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe317 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe312,cwe311 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with the **cleartext storage** of the SSL-VPN password in the FortiTray process. This leads to **exposure of sensitive information** when an attacker runs a logstream for the process. The final impact is a local authenticated attacker obtaining the password.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed towards CWE-200 due to the \"exposure of sensitive information.\" However, the root cause is the **cleartext storage** of the password. This is supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states, \"The FortiTray process within FortiClient for Mac stores the SSL-VPN password in cleartext.\" Therefore, CWE-317 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in GUI) is the more accurate primary CWE because it specifies storage within the GUI, aligning with the vulnerability description. While CWE-200 can still be considered due to the ultimate impact, it's more of a consequence than the root cause. The evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-317 as it directly addresses the coding error.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
