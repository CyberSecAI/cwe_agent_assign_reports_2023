However, in this specific case, CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash) is a more precise root cause than CWE-330 for the CAPTCHA bypass, so CWE-328 is chosen. CWE-804 is chosen as a secondary weakness because the end result is a guessable CAPTCHA.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n    cwe804[\"CWE-804: Guessable CAPTCHA\"]\n    cwe330[\"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe804 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe330\n    cwe804 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe328 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe804\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe328 primary\n    class cwe804 secondary\n    class cwe330,cwe1390 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the use of a **weak hashing algorithm** (CWE-328). This leads to a CAPTCHA secret that can be predicted. The predictable CAPTCHA secret then results in a **guessable CAPTCHA** (CWE-804), allowing attackers to bypass the CAPTCHA protection.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description which clearly states that the **rootcause** is an \"**insufficiently strong hashing algorithm**\" used for the CAPTCHA secret. This directly maps to CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash). The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also confirms this, stating that the plugin uses an \"**insufficiently strong hashing algorithm** for the CAPTCHA secret.\"\n\nThe vulnerability chain clearly shows how the weak hash leads to a bypassable CAPTCHA.\n\nCWE-328 is the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **rootcause** which is the **use of a weak hashing algorithm**.\n\nThe relationships influenced the analysis because CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values) was considered. However, the description specifically mentions the hashing algorithm, making CWE-328 a more accurate fit.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n## Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
