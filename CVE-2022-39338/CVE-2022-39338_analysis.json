CWE-79 is a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')), indicating that XSS is a type of injection.

By inserting a malicious URL into the `authorization_endpoint`, an attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript that would execute when the page is loaded in Safari.\"\n\nThe evidence for CWE-1289 is:\n*   Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: \"**rootcause:** **improper discovery url validation**\"\n*   CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly validate the `authorization_endpoint` URL before inserting it into a `<meta>` tag.\"\n\nCWE-79 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) as it directly describes the XSS vulnerability.\n\nCWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output) was considered, but it's more about the encoding of output to prevent injection, whereas the core issue here is the **improper validation** of the URL, which allows the malicious script to be stored in the first place.\n\nCWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)) was considered, but it describes a situation where the server is fetching content from an unexpected destination, which is not the case here.\n\nCWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) was considered, but the issue isn't about sensitive data being inserted, but rather malicious code being injected.\n\nCWE-923 (Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints) was considered, but this vulnerability doesn't involve a communication channel being directed to the wrong endpoint.\n\nCWE-204 (Observable Response Discrepancy) was considered, but it focuses on information leakage through different responses, not code injection.\n\nCWE-322 (Key Exchange without Entity Authentication) was considered, but it is irrelevant because the vulnerability has nothing to do with key exchange.\n\nCWE-346 (Origin Validation Error) was considered, but the root cause is more specifically about the improper validation of the URL itself, which makes CWE-1289 a more precise fit.\n\nCWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)) was considered, but CSRF is about tricking a user into performing actions, whereas this vulnerability is about injecting malicious code.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was considered, but the problem isn't with authorization, but rather with **improper validation** and subsequent XSS.\n\nCWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) was considered, but it is a class level CWE.",
