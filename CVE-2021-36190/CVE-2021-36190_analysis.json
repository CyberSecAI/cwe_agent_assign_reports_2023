CWE-444 is a Base-level weakness and a child of CWE-436, and could be a good fit. However, the description of CWE-441 is a better fit than CWE-444.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe441[\"CWE-441: Unintended Proxy or Intermediary ('Confused Deputy')\"]\n    cwe610[\"CWE-610: Reliance on untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\"]\n    cwe444[\"CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')\"]\n    cwe436[\"CWE-436: Interpretation Conflict\"]\n\n    cwe441 -->|CHILDOF| cwe610\n    cwe444 -->|CHILDOF| cwe436\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe441 primary\n    class cwe444 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **unintended proxy or intermediary**, which allows an unauthenticated attacker to access protected hosts via crafted HTTP requests.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-441 as the primary weakness due to the vulnerability description containing the key phrase **unintended proxy or intermediary**. This phrase aligns directly with the description of CWE-441. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section reinforces this by stating \"An unintended proxy or intermediary ('Confused Deputy') vulnerability exists in FortiWeb due to improper handling of the `SERVER_NAME`.\"\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-441 as the top combined result, further supporting this choice. The confidence in this assessment is high due to the direct alignment between the vulnerability description, the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\", and the CWE description.\n\nCWE-444 was considered because the vulnerability involves crafted HTTP requests, and CWE-444 deals with inconsistent interpretation of HTTP requests. However, the root cause is more closely related to the unintended proxy behavior than the interpretation of the HTTP requests.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-441 accurately captures the core issue of the FortiWeb device acting as an unintended proxy, while CWE-444 provides a more specific view on the HTTP request handling.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage:

Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as \"/abs/path\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-24: Path Traversal: '../filedir'\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize \"../\" sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers

web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n-
