## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of input validation**, which leads to the **"CHECK fail"** and subsequent crash.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is the **"CHECK fail"** which is a **reachable assertion** (CWE-617) when the input `sparse_matrix` is not a matrix with a shape with rank 0. The root cause is the **lack of input validation** (CWE-20) for the input `sparse_matrix` in `tf.raw_ops.SparseMatrixNNZ`.

Evidence:
- Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: **weakness:** **CHECK fail**
- CVE Reference Links Content Summary: **Lack of Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the insufficient input validation in the `SparseMatrixNNZ` function. It does not check if the provided input is a valid scalar tensor representing a sparse matrix variant which leads to a crash.
- CVE Reference Links Content Summary: **`CHECK_EQ` Fail:** When a non-scalar tensor is passed, the code triggers a `CHECK_EQ` failure, resulting in a crash.

The graph relationships show that CWE-617 is a specific type of uncontrolled state element, while CWE-20 represents the broader issue of input validation. Choosing CWE-617 provides more specific details to the vulnerability, which is allowed by the mapping guidelines.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-41901

## Vulnerability Description
TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. An input `sparse_matrix` that is not a matrix with a shape with rank 0 will trigger a `CHECK` fail in `tf.raw_ops.SparseMatrixNNZ`. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit f856d02e5322821aad155dad9b3acab1e9f5d693. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **CHECK fail**
- **vector:** input sparse_matrix that is not a matrix with a shape with rank 0
- **product:** TensorFlow
- **version:** 2.11, 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and 2.8.4
- **component:** tf.raw_ops.SparseMatrixNNZ

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing check in the `tf.raw_ops.SparseMatrixNNZ` operation within the TensorFlow library. Specifically, the operation fails to validate that the input `sparse_matrix` is a valid sparse matrix representation, expecting a scalar tensor containing a sparse matrix variant and not accepting other tensors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the insufficient input validation in the `SparseMatrixNNZ` function. It does not check if the provided input is a valid scalar tensor representing a sparse matrix variant which leads to a crash.
- **`CHECK_EQ` Fail:**  When a non-scalar tensor is passed, the code triggers a `CHECK_EQ` failure, resulting in a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most significant impact is a denial-of-service vulnerability. By providing a specifically crafted input tensor, an attacker can trigger a crash in the TensorFlow runtime, disrupting the execution of affected TensorFlow applications.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Input Manipulation:** An attacker can directly trigger the vulnerability by crafting an input tensor with an invalid shape and passing it as `sparse_matrix` argument to `tf.raw_ops.SparseMatrixNNZ`.
  
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to control the input to the `tf.raw_ops.SparseMatrixNNZ` operation. This could involve directly using the raw ops within a TensorFlow graph, or indirectly through other TensorFlow API calls that make use of `SparseMatrixNNZ`.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves adding an explicit check in the `ExtractVariantFromInput` function to verify that the input tensor has a rank of 0 (i.e., is a scalar). If not, an `InvalidArgumentError` is returned, avoiding the crash.
- The vulnerable code is present in versions of TensorFlow prior to 2.11.0.
- Patches have been backported to versions 2.8.4, 2.9.3 and 2.10.1.

**Summary of changes in the provided commit:**
- In `tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse/sparse_matrix.h`, the `ExtractVariantFromInput` function was modified to validate that the input tensor is a scalar using `TensorShapeUtils::IsScalar(input_t.shape())`. It now returns an `InvalidArgument` error if the shape is not scalar, preventing the crash.
- In `tensorflow/python/kernel_tests/linalg/sparse/csr_sparse_matrix_ops_test.py` a test `testNoMatrixNoCrash` has been added to verify that calling `sparse_matrix_nnz` with an empty matrix does not cause a crash, but rather throws an error.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

### Extended Description


If the pointer contains an uninitialized value, then the value might not point to a valid memory location. This could cause the product to read from or write to unexpected memory locations, leading to a denial of service. If the uninitialized pointer is used as a function call, then arbitrary functions could be invoked. If an attacker can influence the portion of uninitialized memory that is contained in the pointer, this weakness could be leveraged to execute code or perform other attacks.


Depending on memory layout, associated memory management behaviors, and product operation, the attacker might be able to influence the contents of the uninitialized pointer, thus gaining more fine-grained control of the memory location to be accessed.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.

**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of "memory corruption" or "memory safety." As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-32878:** LLM product has a free of an uninitialized pointer
- **CVE-2010-0211:** chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) leads to free of invalid, uninitialized pointer (CWE-824).
- **CVE-2009-2768:** Pointer in structure is not initialized, leading to NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) and system crash.




## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values. If the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur.

- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268:** Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)




## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.

- **CVE-2008-1440:** lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop
- **CVE-2008-2374:** lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read




## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.

### Extended Description


While assertion is good for catching logic errors and reducing the chances of reaching more serious vulnerability conditions, it can still lead to a denial of service.


For example, if a server handles multiple simultaneous connections, and an assert() occurs in one single connection that causes all other connections to be dropped, this is a reachable assertion that leads to a denial of service.

- **CVE-2006-6811:** Chat client allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a long message string when connecting to a server, which causes an assertion failure.




## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.

### Extended Description


Often, complex inputs are expected to follow a particular syntax, which is either assumed by the input itself, or declared within metadata such as headers. The syntax could be for data exchange formats, markup languages, or even programming languages. When untrusted input is not properly validated for the expected syntax, attackers could cause parsing failures, trigger unexpected errors, or expose latent vulnerabilities that might not be directly exploitable if the input had conformed to the syntax.

- **CVE-2007-5893:** HTTP request with missing protocol version number leads to crash




## CWE-1287: Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to be of a certain type, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually of the expected type.

### Extended Description


When input does not comply with the expected type, attackers could trigger unexpected errors, cause incorrect actions to take place, or exploit latent vulnerabilities that would not be possible if the input conformed with the expected type.


This weakness can appear in type-unsafe programming languages, or in programming languages that support casting or conversion of an input to another type.
