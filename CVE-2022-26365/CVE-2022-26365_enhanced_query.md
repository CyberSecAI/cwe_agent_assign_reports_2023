# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-26365

# Vulnerability Description

    Linux disk/nic frontends data leaks T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Linux Block and Network PV device frontends dont zero memory regions before sharing them with the backend (CVE-2022-26365, CVE-2022-33740). Additionally the granularity of the grant table doesnt allow sharing less than a 4K page, leading to **unrelated data residing in the same 4K page** as data shared with a backend being accessible by such backend (CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742).
