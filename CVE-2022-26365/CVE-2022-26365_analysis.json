Additionally, the parent relationship between CWE-212 and CWE-1258 was considered since there is exposure of sensitive data as a result of the **failure to remove data before transfer**. CWE-212 is a Base level CWE which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n    cwe1258[\"CWE-1258: Redundant Data Exposure\"]\n    cwe669[\"CWE-669: Incorrect Behavior on Memory Allocation Error\"]\n\n    cwe1258 -->|CHILDOF| cwe212\n    cwe212 -->|CHILDOF| cwe669\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe212 primary\n    class cwe1258 secondary\n    class cwe669 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to zero memory regions before sharing them**, leading to **information disclosure** and **unrelated data residing in the same 4K page** being accessible.\n  - Root Cause: **Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer** (CWE-212)\n  - Impact: Exposure of sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis focused on the provided keyphrases and their relationship to potential CWEs. The primary **root cause** identified is the **failure to zero memory regions before sharing them with the backend**, directly aligning with **CWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer)**. This CWE accurately captures the essence of the vulnerability, where sensitive information is not properly removed before being made accessible to unauthorized actors. The high retriever score for CWE-212 across multiple keyphrases further supports this selection.\n\nCWE-1258 Redundant Data Exposure was considered as a secondary weakness because the **failure to properly sanitize memory before sharing it results in redundant data exposure**.\n\nThe final decision is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description, particularly the phrase **\"don't zero memory regions before sharing them with the backend\"**, which clearly indicates **improper removal of sensitive information**. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, providing a clear and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
