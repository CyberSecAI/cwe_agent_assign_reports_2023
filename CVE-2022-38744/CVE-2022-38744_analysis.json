It's a child of CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource). The secondary CWE, CWE-306, is a Base-level weakness describing the absence of authentication for critical functions, a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication). The choice of CWE-400 reflects the DoS impact, while CWE-306 accounts for the lack of authentication that enables the attack.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe400 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n    class cwe664,cwe287 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing authentication** (CWE-306) which leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400), eventually resulting in a denial-of-service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitial analysis focused on the denial-of-service impact and the unauthenticated attack vector. The Retriever results suggested CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) and CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) as relevant.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"An **unauthenticated attacker** with network access to a victims Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk Alarm and Events service could open a connection, causing the service to fault and **become unavailable**.\"\n\nThe **lack of authentication** allows an attacker to open a connection, which then causes the service to fault and become unavailable. This aligns with CWE-306, Missing Authentication for Critical Function, since the service lacks proper authentication for accepting connections.\n\nThe \"service to fault and become unavailable\" points towards a **denial-of-service** condition. This is due to the service's resources being exhausted or otherwise rendered unusable by the attacker's connection. This aligns with CWE-400, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, as the service does not properly control the resources used when establishing connections.\n\nCWE-400 is chosen as the primary weakness because the vulnerability's impact is a denial-of-service condition resulting from uncontrolled resource consumption. CWE-306 is a secondary weakness because the **lack of authentication** is the enabler of the resource consumption.\n\nBoth CWEs are chosen because they provide the best level of specificity based on the available information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n*Was considered but not selected because this CWE is too generic and doesn't specifically address the **missing authentication** or **resource consumption** aspects of the vulnerability.*\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Was considered but not selected because the vulnerability doesn't seem to rely on untrusted inputs for a security decision, but rather **lacks authentication** altogether.*\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Was considered but not selected because the vulnerability is not about the exposure of sensitive information, but rather about the **lack of authentication** leading to a **denial-of-service**.*\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Was considered but not selected because the vulnerability does not seem to have an incorrect implementation, but rather a **missing implementation of authentication**.*\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
