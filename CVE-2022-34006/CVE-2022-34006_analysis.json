The secondary CWE, CWE-250 **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**, is a child of CWE-269 **Improper Privilege Management**. Selecting CWE-276 is more specific and accurately reflects the **incorrect default permissions** set during the installation of Microsoft SQL Express.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe276[\"CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe250[\"CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n\n    cwe276 -->|CHILDOF| cwe732\n    cwe250 -->|CHILDOF| cwe269\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe276 primary\n    class cwe250 secondary\n    class cwe732,cwe269 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect default permissions** (CWE-276) assigned to the SQL instance during installation, leading to **execution with unnecessary privileges** (CWE-250) because BUILTIN\\Users were granted sysadmin privileges, allowing unprivileged users to execute commands as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **incorrect SQL Server configuration** during installation. The vulnerability description indicates that Microsoft SQL Express 2019 installs with an SQL instance running as SYSTEM with BUILTIN\\Users as sysadmin, allowing unprivileged Windows users to execute commands locally as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.\n\nThe Retriever Results highlighted several potential CWEs, including CWE-250, CWE-259, CWE-276, and CWE-269.\n\nThe final decision was to assign CWE-276 **Incorrect Default Permissions** as the primary CWE, as it most accurately describes the root cause of the vulnerability: the **incorrect configuration** of SQL Server during installation that grants excessive privileges to unprivileged users. The supporting evidence is the **weakness** described as **SQL Server configuration**.\n\nCWE-250 **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges** was selected as a secondary CWE because the **incorrect permissions** lead to the SQL instance running with higher privileges than necessary.\n\nCWE-276 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-259 **Use of Hard-coded Password**: This CWE was considered but not selected because the vulnerability does not involve a hard-coded password.\n*   CWE-269 **Improper Privilege Management**: This CWE was considered but not selected as it is a more general class, and CWE-276 provides a more specific description of the **incorrect permissions** being the root cause.\n*   CWE-732 **Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource**: This CWE was considered, but it's a Class level CWE, making it less specific than CWE-276, which is a Base level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
