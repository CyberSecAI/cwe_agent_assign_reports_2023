## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause** of **session cookie not signed**. This leads to the ability to modify session data and ultimately escalate privileges to gain admin access.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified CWE-290 as the primary weakness due to the ability to bypass authentication through spoofing. The vulnerability description and CVE reference summary support this by stating that session data is not properly verified, allowing attackers to modify it. The retriever results also list CWE-290 as the top candidate.

CWE-290 is a Base level, which aligns with the guidance to prefer lower-level CWEs. The description of CWE-290 matches the vulnerability's characteristics: "This attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks." The **impact** is significant, as a malicious actor can modify session data to gain unauthorized access and escalate privileges.

CWE-613 is included as a secondary weakness because the **insufficient session expiration** contributes to the overall vulnerability. If sessions expired correctly, the window of opportunity for an attacker to exploit the spoofed session would be reduced.

CWE-287 was considered but classified as a secondary concern because it is a more general class of improper authentication. CWE-290 provides a more specific description of the spoofing attack.

The final decision is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description, the retriever results, and the CWE specifications, which support the selection of CWE-290 as the primary weakness and CWE-613 as a contributing factor. The confidence in this assessment is high (0.8) due to the clear alignment between the vulnerability details and the selected CWEs.

Relevant CWE Information:
- **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** **rootcause:** **session cookie not signed**

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-23131

## Vulnerability Description
In the case of instances where the SAML SSO authentication is enabled (non-default), session data can be modified by a malicious actor, because a user login stored in the session was not verified. Malicious unauthenticated actor may exploit this issue to escalate privileges and gain admin access to Zabbix Frontend. To perform the attack, SAML authentication is required to be enabled and the actor has to know the username of Zabbix user (or use the guest account, which is disabled by default).

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **session cookie not signed**
- **impact:** modify session data and escalate privileges and gain admin access
- **vector:** unauthenticated privilege escalation
- **attacker:** malicious actor
- **product:** Zabbix Frontend

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from unsafe client-side session storage in Zabbix Frontend when SAML SSO authentication is enabled. Session data, including user login information, was not being properly verified, allowing for manipulation by malicious actors.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of server-side validation of session data stored client-side when SAML authentication is in use. This allows an attacker to modify the session data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can modify session data to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the Zabbix Frontend. This can lead to privilege escalation and potential instance takeover, including gaining admin access.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves exploiting the client-side session storage vulnerability. The attacker needs to know the username of a Zabbix user or utilize the guest account (if enabled). The attacker then modifies the session data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have knowledge of a valid Zabbix username or use a guest account if enabled. The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify client-side session data. SAML authentication must be enabled on the targeted Zabbix instance.

- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.




## CWE-384: Session Fixation
**Abstraction:** Compound
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Authenticating a user, or otherwise establishing a new user session, without invalidating any existing session identifier gives an attacker the opportunity to steal authenticated sessions.

### Extended Description


Such a scenario is commonly observed when:


  - A web application authenticates a user without first invalidating the existing session, thereby continuing to use the session already associated with the user.

  - An attacker is able to force a known session identifier on a user so that, once the user authenticates, the attacker has access to the authenticated session.

  - The application or container uses predictable session identifiers.

In the generic exploit of session fixation vulnerabilities, an attacker creates a new session on a web application and records the associated session identifier. The attacker then causes the victim to associate, and possibly authenticate, against the server using that session identifier, giving the attacker access to the user's account through the active session.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.
**Comments:** While attack-oriented composites are supported in CWE, they have not been a focus of research. There is a chance that future research or CWE scope clarifications will change or deprecate them. Perform root-cause analysis to determine which weaknesses allow session fixation to occur, and map to those weaknesses. For example, predictable session identifiers might enable session fixation attacks to succeed; if this occurs, they might be better characterized as randomness/predictability weaknesses.
**Reasons:**
- Other


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Other attack vectors include DNS poisoning and related network based attacks where an attacker causes the user to visit a malicious site by redirecting a request for a valid site. Network based attacks typically involve a physical presence on the victim's network or control of a compromised machine on the network, which makes them harder to exploit remotely, but their significance should not be overlooked. Less secure session management mechanisms, such as the default implementation in Apache Tomcat, allow session identifiers normally expected in a cookie to be specified on the URL as well, which enables an attacker to cause a victim to use a fixed session identifier simply by emailing a malicious URL.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-2820:** Website software for game servers does not proprerly terminate user sessions, allowing for possible session fixation




## CWE-567: Unsynchronized Access to Shared Data in a Multithreaded Context
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly synchronize shared data, such as static variables across threads, which can lead to undefined behavior and unpredictable data changes.

### Extended Description


Within servlets, shared static variables are not protected from concurrent access, but servlets are multithreaded. This is a typical programming mistake in J2EE applications, since the multithreading is handled by the framework. When a shared variable can be influenced by an attacker, one thread could wind up modifying the variable to contain data that is not valid for a different thread that is also using the data within the variable.


Note that this weakness is not unique to servlets.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** overlaps Unprotected Alternate Channel



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2000-1179:** Router allows remote attackers to read system logs without authentication by directly connecting to the login screen and typing certain control characters.
- **CVE-1999-1454:** Attackers with physical access to the machine may bypass the password prompt by pressing the ESC (Escape) key.
- **CVE-1999-1077:** OS allows local attackers to bypass the password protection of idled sessions via the programmer's switch or CMD-PWR keyboard sequence, which brings up a debugger that the attacker can use to disable the lock.




## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction:** Compound
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

### Extended Description
When a web server is designed to receive a request from a client without any mechanism for verifying that it was intentionally sent, then it might be possible for an attacker to trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server which will be treated as an authentic request. This can be done via a URL, image load, XMLHttpRequest, etc. and can result in exposure of data or unintended code execution.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.
**Comments:** While attack-oriented composites are supported in CWE, they have not been a focus of research. There is a chance that future research or CWE scope clarifications will change or deprecate them. Perform root-cause analysis to determine if other weaknesses allow CSRF attacks to occur, and map to those weaknesses. For example, predictable CSRF tokens might allow bypass of CSRF protection mechanisms; if this occurs, they might be better characterized as randomness/predictability weaknesses.
**Reasons:**
- Other


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

There can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.


**[Theoretical]** 

The CSRF topology is multi-channel:


  - Attacker (as outsider) to intermediary (as user). The interaction point is either an external or internal channel.

  - Intermediary (as user) to server (as victim). The activation point is an internal channel.

- **CVE-2004-1995:** Add user accounts via a URL in an img tag
- **CVE-2004-1967:** Arbitrary code execution by specifying the code in a crafted img tag or URL




## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.

### Extended Description
Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.
