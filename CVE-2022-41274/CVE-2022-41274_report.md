# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2022-41274

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-668 | Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere | 0.8 | Class | Discouraged | The **misconfigured application endpoints** led to the exposure of sensitive data |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship considered was the ChildOf relationship. CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) is a child of CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime). The abstraction level influenced the selection because while more specific CWEs might exist, the current evidence strongly suggests a resource was exposed to the wrong sphere due to misconfiguration, aligning with the general nature of CWE-668.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **misconfigured application endpoints** which directly leads to the impact of reading sensitive data.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on the **misconfigured application endpoints** as the root cause, leading to the exposure of sensitive data.

The selection of CWE-668 is based on the evidence that **misconfigured application endpoints** allowed an authenticated attacker to read sensitive data. This aligns with CWE-668's description: "The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource."

The graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the parent-child relationship between CWE-668 and CWE-664. While other CWEs were considered, CWE-668 best fits the specific scenario described in the vulnerability description.

The selected CWE is at the Class level of specificity. While more specific CWEs could potentially apply, the current evidence does not provide enough detail to justify a more granular classification.

**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was considered but not chosen because it is discouraged by MITRE as it is often misused and represents an impact rather than a root cause. CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) were also considered, but the provided information does not suggest a missing or incorrect authorization mechanism, but rather a **misconfiguration** that led to exposure.
