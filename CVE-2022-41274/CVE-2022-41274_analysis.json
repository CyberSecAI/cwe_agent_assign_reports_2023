CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) is a child of CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime). The abstraction level influenced the selection because while more specific CWEs might exist, the current evidence strongly suggests a resource was exposed to the wrong sphere due to misconfiguration, aligning with the general nature of CWE-668.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\"]\n\n    cwe668 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe668 primary\n    class cwe664 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **misconfigured application endpoints** which directly leads to the impact of reading sensitive data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **misconfigured application endpoints** as the root cause, leading to the exposure of sensitive data.\n\nThe selection of CWE-668 is based on the evidence that **misconfigured application endpoints** allowed an authenticated attacker to read sensitive data. This aligns with CWE-668's description: \"The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the parent-child relationship between CWE-668 and CWE-664. While other CWEs were considered, CWE-668 best fits the specific scenario described in the vulnerability description.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the Class level of specificity. While more specific CWEs could potentially apply, the current evidence does not provide enough detail to justify a more granular classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
