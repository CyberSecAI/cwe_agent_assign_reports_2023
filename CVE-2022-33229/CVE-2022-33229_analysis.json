The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a \"**buffer over-read**\", which aligns with CWE-126's definition of reading memory locations after the targeted buffer. CWE-126 is a child of CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), which is a more general case.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n\n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe125\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe126 primary\n    class cwe125 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves a **buffer over-read** leading to information disclosure while processing IPv4 packets in a modem.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description and retriever results, points towards CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read) as the primary weakness. The description explicitly states \"**buffer over-read**,\" which directly matches CWE-126. The retriever results also rank CWE-126 as the top candidate.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"Information disclosure due to **buffer over-read** in Modem while using static array to process IPv4 packets.\" This statement provides direct evidence for classifying the vulnerability as CWE-126.\n\nCWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) was considered as a more general classification, but CWE-126 is a more specific variant that better describes the vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-126 is at the optimal level of specificity because it precisely captures the nature of the **buffer over-read**, which is the root cause of the information disclosure.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly

larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation.
