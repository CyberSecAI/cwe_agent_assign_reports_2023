While CWE-400 describes the general problem, CWE-770 and CWE-789 provides a more specific description of the vulnerability, which is the allocation of resources without limits, which results in excessive memory allocation. CWE-789 is chosen as the primary CWE because it specifically talks about excessive memory allocation based on an untrusted size value. The other important relationship is CANPRECEDE between CWE-789 and CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference)\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n    \n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe789 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe476\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe789 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **attacker** providing a **malformed TIFF image**. The `DecodeConfig` function attempts to allocate memory based on the size values specified in the image without proper validation (**improper input validation**). This results in **excessive memory allocation** (CWE-789) leading to **denial of service**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, several CWEs were considered based on the \"Retriever Results,\" but the final decision was heavily influenced by the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which specifically mentioned **uncontrolled resource consumption** due to excessive memory allocation.\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states: \"The vulnerability stems from an **uncontrolled resource consumption** issue within the `golang.org/x/image/tiff` package. Specifically, the `DecodeConfig` function within the TIFF decoder is vulnerable to **excessive memory allocation** when processing maliciously crafted TIFF images. The decoder attempts to pre-allocate large slices before reading, which an attacker can exploit to exhaust available memory.\"\n\nThis directly supports the selection of CWE-789 (**Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value**) as the primary weakness. The description of CWE-789 states: \"The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\" This aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description.\n\nCWE-400 (**Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**) and CWE-770 (**Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**) were considered because the vulnerability leads to resource exhaustion. However, they are less specific than CWE-789, which pinpoints the root cause to the excessive memory allocation due to an untrusted size value. Therefore, CWE-789 is the most appropriate choice.\n\nThe selection of CWE-789 is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is preferred. The mapping guidance for CWE-789 allows its usage and notes that one should carefully read the name and description to ensure that the mapping is an appropriate fit.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n#
