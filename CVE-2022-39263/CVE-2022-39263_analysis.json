CWE-1390 is \"Weak Authentication,\" which is a more specific type of \"Improper Authentication\" (CWE-287). Both are class-level CWEs. I am selecting the parent because there is no base level CWE that matches the description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe1390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe1390 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is:\n1.  **ROOTCAUSE:** **Improper token verification** (as stated in the Vulnerability Description Key Phrases).\n2.  **WEAKNESS:** The `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow (as stated in the Vulnerability Description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary).\n3.  **IMPACT:** Account takeover (as stated in the Vulnerability Description Key Phrases).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nMy analysis indicates that CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) are the most relevant CWEs for this vulnerability.\n\nThe vulnerability lies in the **improper token verification** within the `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter`. The adapter only checked the identifier (email) and not the token when verifying the token in the email callback flow. This constitutes a form of **weak authentication**, as the system **does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct**.\n\nThe analysis relies on the provided information, specifically:\n*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**: \"*rootcause: improper token verification*\", \"*impact: account takeover*\"\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**: \"*The vulnerability lies in the `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter`'s implementation of email verification.
