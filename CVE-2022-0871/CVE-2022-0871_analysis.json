It is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) was considered as a possible alternative. CWE-862 was favored because the description explicitly mentioned \"**missing authorization**.\" While the vulnerability also relates to authentication, the core issue described involves the absence of authorization checks after a (potentially flawed) authentication process.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|ChildOf| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing authorization** check, which leads to a potential authentication bypass.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) as the primary candidate due to the explicit mention of \"**missing authorization**\" in the vulnerability description. The CVE reference summary further reinforces this by highlighting the improper handling of PAM authorization. The analysis of the code diff shows that the error handling was improper, leading to a double authentication call, but the root cause is the **missing authorization** check after the first call failed. This indicates that the system does not ensure the user is authorized to perform actions after the first authentication, thus leading to the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) was considered but deemed less specific. While the vulnerability can lead to an authentication bypass, the core issue is the **missing authorization** check after the authentication process, making CWE-862 a more accurate representation of the root cause.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The CWE's description aligns well with the vulnerability's details, and the mapping guidance allows for its use with review. While a base-level CWE would be preferred, there is no base-level child of CWE-862 that fits the description better.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions is not set, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
