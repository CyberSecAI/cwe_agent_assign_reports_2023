Since the vulnerability description specifically mentions the absence of a salt, the more specific variant, CWE-759, is chosen over its base CWE. Additionally, the relationship of CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) as a peer of CWE-523 (Unprotected Transport of Credentials) and child of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) was considered, but the absence of salting is the more direct root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe759[\"CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt\"]\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe759 -->|CHILDOF| cwe916\n    cwe312 -->|PEEROF| cwe759\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe759 primary\n    class cwe312 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of salting of user passwords** (**ROOT CAUSE**), leading to the ability to view unsalted user passwords. This can lead to the **disclosure of sensitive information** (unsalted password hashes) and finally to the **compromise of plaintext passwords via offline attacks** (IMPACT).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** and the **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**. The application stores user passwords without salting them, allowing administrators to view these unsalted password hashes. This directly matches the description of CWE-759 (Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt), as it highlights the **lack of a salt** in the hashing process.\n\nThe selection of CWE-759 is further justified by its Variant level of abstraction, which provides a more specific classification than its parent CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort). While CWE-916 is also relevant, CWE-759 directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) was also considered as a possibility due to the viewing of unsalted passwords by administrators, however, this is not the primary weakness but a secondary impact, making it a weaker candidate.\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately represents the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **absence of a salt** in the password hashing process. This enables offline attacks and compromises the security of user passwords.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction
