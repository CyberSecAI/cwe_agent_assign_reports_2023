## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis

The primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is the parent-child relationship between CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) and CWE-759 (Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt). Since the vulnerability description specifically mentions the absence of a salt, the more specific variant, CWE-759, is chosen over its base CWE. Additionally, the relationship of CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) as a peer of CWE-523 (Unprotected Transport of Credentials) and child of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) was considered, but the absence of salting is the more direct root cause.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of salting of user passwords** (**ROOT CAUSE**), leading to the ability to view unsalted user passwords. This can lead to the **disclosure of sensitive information** (unsalted password hashes) and finally to the **compromise of plaintext passwords via offline attacks** (IMPACT).

## Summary of Analysis

The analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** and the **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**. The application stores user passwords without salting them, allowing administrators to view these unsalted password hashes. This directly matches the description of CWE-759 (Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt), as it highlights the **lack of a salt** in the hashing process.

The selection of CWE-759 is further justified by its Variant level of abstraction, which provides a more specific classification than its parent CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort). While CWE-916 is also relevant, CWE-759 directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability.

CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) was also considered as a possibility due to the viewing of unsalted passwords by administrators, however, this is not the primary weakness but a secondary impact, making it a weaker candidate.
The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately represents the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **absence of a salt** in the password hashing process. This enables offline attacks and compromises the security of user passwords.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses default credentials (such as passwords or cryptographic keys) for potentially critical functionality.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
