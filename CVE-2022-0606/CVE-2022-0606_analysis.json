There is also a potential out-of-bounds write as indicated in the description as **heap corruption**, which relates to **CWE-787**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    \n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **Use After Free** (**CWE-416**), potentially leading to **heap corruption** which can be represented as an out-of-bounds write (**CWE-787**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment correctly identified **CWE-416 (Use After Free)** as the primary weakness, aligning with the vulnerability description that explicitly states \"**Use after free** in ANGLE... allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit **heap corruption**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further reinforces this, stating the root cause as \"Use after free\". The retriever results also highlight **CWE-416** as the top combined result.\n\nThe description also indicates **heap corruption**, which is often caused by out-of-bounds writes. Thus, **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)** was also considered.\n\nThe final decision is based heavily on the provided evidence, primarily the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. **CWE-416** is selected as the primary CWE because it is explicitly mentioned as the root cause. The graph relationships also support the consideration of **CWE-787** as a secondary CWE, as **Use After Free** can precede an out-of-bounds write. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with **CWE-416** being a Variant and **CWE-787** being a Base.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
