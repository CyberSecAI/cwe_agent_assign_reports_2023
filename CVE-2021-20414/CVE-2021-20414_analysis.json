CWE-307 is a child of CWE-799, representing a more specific case related to authentication attempts. While CWE-307 is more specific (Base), the description mentions a general lack of limiting interactions, not just authentication. Therefore, the higher-level CWE-799 is more appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe799[\"CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\"]\n    cwe307[\"CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts\"]\n\n    cwe307 -->|CHILDOF| cwe799\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe799 primary\n    class cwe307 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause** of \"**not properly limiting the number of interactions**,\" leading to the impact of a user being able to brute force **sensitive information**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis focuses on the **root cause** identified in the vulnerability description: \"**not properly limiting the number of interactions**\". This directly aligns with CWE-799 (Improper Control of Interaction Frequency), which describes a product's failure to adequately limit interactions with an actor.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"IBM Guardium Data Encryption (GDE) 3.0.0.2 could allow a user to bruce force **sensitive information** due to **not properly limiting the number of interactions**.\" This statement provides direct evidence that the product does not properly limit interactions, leading to a brute-force vulnerability.\n\nCWE-799's description matches this scenario: \"The product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\" The description also includes \"brute force\" as an alternative term, further strengthening the match.\n\nCWE-307 (Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts) was considered because brute-forcing often involves authentication. However, the description doesn't explicitly mention authentication attempts; it refers to a general lack of limiting interactions. Therefore, CWE-799 is a better fit as it captures the broader issue.\n\nThe selection of CWE-799 is at the optimal level of specificity. While it's a Class-level CWE, its description accurately reflects the **root cause** described in the vulnerability. The guidance recommends examining child entries for a better fit, but in this case, the broader scope of CWE-799 is more appropriate than its child, CWE-307.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
