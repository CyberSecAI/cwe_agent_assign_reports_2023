# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2021-20414

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-799 | Improper Control of Interaction Frequency | 1.0 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE |
| CWE-307 | Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-799, which is a Class-level CWE. CWE-307 is a child of CWE-799, representing a more specific case related to authentication attempts. While CWE-307 is more specific (Base), the description mentions a general lack of limiting interactions, not just authentication. Therefore, the higher-level CWE-799 is more appropriate.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause** of "**not properly limiting the number of interactions**," leading to the impact of a user being able to brute force **sensitive information**.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis focuses on the **root cause** identified in the vulnerability description: "**not properly limiting the number of interactions**". This directly aligns with CWE-799 (Improper Control of Interaction Frequency), which describes a product's failure to adequately limit interactions with an actor.

The vulnerability description states: "IBM Guardium Data Encryption (GDE) 3.0.0.2 could allow a user to bruce force **sensitive information** due to **not properly limiting the number of interactions**." This statement provides direct evidence that the product does not properly limit interactions, leading to a brute-force vulnerability.

CWE-799's description matches this scenario: "The product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests." The description also includes "brute force" as an alternative term, further strengthening the match.

CWE-307 (Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts) was considered because brute-forcing often involves authentication. However, the description doesn't explicitly mention authentication attempts; it refers to a general lack of limiting interactions. Therefore, CWE-799 is a better fit as it captures the broader issue.

The selection of CWE-799 is at the optimal level of specificity. While it's a Class-level CWE, its description accurately reflects the **root cause** described in the vulnerability. The guidance recommends examining child entries for a better fit, but in this case, the broader scope of CWE-799 is more appropriate than its child, CWE-307.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information without properly limiting read or write access by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
