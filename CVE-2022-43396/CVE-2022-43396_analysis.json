CWE-78 represents the OS command injection that results from the bypass of the blacklist, which is a consequence of CWE-184. Both are Base level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe184[\"CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\"]\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command\"]\n    cwe184 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe78\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe184 primary\n    class cwe78 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incomplete blacklist** (CWE-184), which allows a user to **bypass the filter**. This leads to **OS command injection** (CWE-78), where the user can control the command being executed.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly states that the **root cause** is a **bypass of the blacklist to filter user input commands**. The primary CWE is therefore CWE-184, Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs. The impact is OS command injection (CWE-78), as the user can control the command by controlling the `kylin.engine.spark-cmd` parameter. The abstraction level of both selected CWEs is Base, which is the preferred level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a query intended to access or manipulate data in a data store such as a database, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that can modify the intended logic of the query.\n**Not Used:** This CWE is specific to data query logic and not applicable here.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n**Not Used:** This CWE is not applicable, as it focuses on unsafe equivalence in input rather than a blacklist bypass.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n**Used:** The vulnerability description states: \"In the fix for CVE-2022-24697, a blacklist is used to filter user input commands. But there is a risk of being bypassed.\" This aligns directly with the description of CWE-184.\n**Rationale:** \"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\"\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n**Not Used:** Too broad; CWE-78 is more specific.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n**Not Used:** The vulnerability description indicates the use of a blacklist and not an allowlist.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n**Not Used:** While applicable, it's less specific than CWE-184, which directly addresses the incomplete blacklist.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n**Not Used:** Too broad; CWE-78 is more specific.\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n**Not Used:** This is specific to expression language statements and not applicable here.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n**Not Used:** This is specific to XSS and not applicable here.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n**Not Used:** This is not the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 7366.00\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n**Not Used:** Though related to command injection, it's more about argument handling, not a bypassed blacklist.\n\n## CWE-1427: Improper Neutralization of Input Used for LLM Prompting\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 7050.94\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses externally-provided data to build prompts provided to\nlarge language models (LLMs), but the way these prompts are constructed\ncauses the LLM to fail to distinguish between user-supplied inputs and\ndeveloper provided system directives.\n**Not Used:** This is specific to LLM prompting, not relevant to the described vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 7005.61\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.\n**Not Used:** Not related to path traversal.\n\n## CWE-7",
