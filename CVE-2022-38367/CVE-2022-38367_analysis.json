Also, the ChildOf relationship between CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and also to CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). While CWE-284 is a high-level Pillar, the vulnerability clearly indicates a **lack of authorization checks**, pushing towards CWE-862. The Retriever Results also suggest considering CWE-306, which reflects **missing authentication**, a closely related concept.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n    class cwe284,cwe285,cwe287 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization check**. This leads directly to the impact of an unauthenticated user being able to export all users from Jira.\n\nMissing Authorization -> Unauthenticated User Exports Jira Users\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed strongly towards CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) because the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** include \"**does not perform authorization checks**\" as the root cause. The retriever results reinforce this, with CWE-862 being a top candidate.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is: \"The Netic User Export add-on before 2.0.6 for Atlassian Jira **does not perform authorization checks**. This might allow an unauthenticated user to export all users from Jira by making an HTTP request to the affected endpoint.\"\n\nCWE-862 is a Class-level CWE, and per the mapping guidance, a Base-level CWE is preferred. However, there isn't a more specific child CWE of CWE-862 that better captures the essence of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) was also considered since the attacker is unauthenticated. It could be argued that exporting all users is a critical function that requires authentication, but since authorization is explicitly mentioned, CWE-862 is the more direct fit. However, the fact that the user is unauthenticated should at least be noted as a secondary weakness.\n\nTherefore, CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is the most appropriate primary CWE, with CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) as a secondary consideration, based on the information provided and relationship analysis.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity

vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements

more appropriate\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application

an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.\n\n**Mapping

CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
