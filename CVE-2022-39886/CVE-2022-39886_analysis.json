CWE-285 is a child of the Pillar CWE-284: Improper Access Control. CWE-863 is a child of CWE-285. The abstraction levels influenced the decision to choose CWE-285 as the primary since it is a Class and a better fit than the Pillar.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of weaknesses starts with **improper access control** leading to unauthorized access to device information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **improper access control** vulnerability. The retriever results suggested CWE-280, CWE-284 and CWE-285 as potential candidates.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"**Improper access control** vulnerability in IpcRxServiceModeBigDataInfo in RIL prior to SMR Nov-2022 Release 1 allows local attacker to access Device information.\"\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"*   **Root Cause:** An improper access control vulnerability exists in the `IpcRxServiceModeBigDataInfo` function within the Radio Interface Layer (RIL).\" and \"*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability lies in insufficient access control checks within the RIL component. This allows unauthorized access to device information.\"\n\nGiven the information and guidance, the decision was to select CWE-285 Improper Authorization as the primary CWE. This is because the vulnerability stems from incorrect authorization checks, allowing unauthorized access to device information. While CWE-284 is more general, CWE-285 is a Class level CWE and more descriptive of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-863 Incorrect Authorization was considered as a possibility, but decided it was not a fit since it is a Class level CWE and the description says \"*The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.*\" There is no information in the description that suggests an authorization check was performed but done incorrectly.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
