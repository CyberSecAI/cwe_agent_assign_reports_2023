## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The analysis identified a primary weakness related to logging sensitive information (CWE-532) alongside contributing factors related to **insecure permissions** (CWE-732) and potentially weak hashing (CWE-916). CWE-532 is a base-level weakness describing the **insertion of sensitive information** into log files. CWE-732, a class-level weakness, covers **incorrect permission assignment**, which directly relates to the **insecure access permissions** on the log files. CWE-916, another base-level weakness, addresses the potential for **insufficient computational effort** in password hashing, potentially enabling easier brute-force attacks.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **insertion of password hashes** into log files (CWE-532). The log files have **insecure access permissions** (CWE-732). The password hashes might not provide sufficient computational effort making them more prone to brute-force attacks (CWE-916). The impact is a local attacker can attempt offline brute-force attacks.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on the fact that Confd log files contain local users, including roots, SHA512crypt password hashes with **insecure access permissions**. This allows a local attacker to attempt off-line brute-force attacks against these password hashes in Sophos UTM before version 9.710.

The primary weakness is CWE-532, which describes the **insertion of sensitive information** into log files. This is directly supported by the vulnerability description, which mentions that Confd log files contain password hashes. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" states: "Confd log files contained local users', including root's, SHA512crypt password hashes with **insecure access permissions**."

CWE-732, **Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource**, is included as a secondary weakness because the log files have **insecure access permissions**, allowing unauthorized access. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" supports this by explicitly stating: "Insecure access permissions on confd log files."

CWE-916, **Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort**, is a secondary weakness because the SHA512crypt password hashes may be vulnerable to brute-force attacks due to insufficient computational effort. This is implied by the vulnerability description stating that a local attacker could attempt off-line brute-force attacks against the exposed password hashes.

The selected CWEs are at an optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root causes and contributing factors described in the vulnerability description.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.81
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an algorithm or scheme that produces insufficient entropy, leaving patterns or clusters of values that are more likely to occur than others.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-335: Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) but does not correctly manage seeds.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
To fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.
