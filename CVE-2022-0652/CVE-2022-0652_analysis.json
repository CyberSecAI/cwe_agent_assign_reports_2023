CWE-532 is a base-level weakness describing the **insertion of sensitive information** into log files. CWE-732, a class-level weakness, covers **incorrect permission assignment**, which directly relates to the **insecure access permissions** on the log files. CWE-916, another base-level weakness, addresses the potential for **insufficient computational effort** in password hashing, potentially enabling easier brute-force attacks.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe328\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe732,cwe916 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insertion of password hashes** into log files (CWE-532). The log files have **insecure access permissions** (CWE-732). The password hashes might not provide sufficient computational effort making them more prone to brute-force attacks (CWE-916). The impact is a local attacker can attempt offline brute-force attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the fact that Confd log files contain local users, including roots, SHA512crypt password hashes with **insecure access permissions**. This allows a local attacker to attempt off-line brute-force attacks against these password hashes in Sophos UTM before version 9.710.\n\nThe primary weakness is CWE-532, which describes the **insertion of sensitive information** into log files. This is directly supported by the vulnerability description, which mentions that Confd log files contain password hashes. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states: \"Confd log files contained local users', including root's, SHA512crypt password hashes with **insecure access permissions**.\"\n\nCWE-732, **Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource**, is included as a secondary weakness because the log files have **insecure access permissions**, allowing unauthorized access. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" supports this by explicitly stating: \"Insecure access permissions on confd log files.\"\n\nCWE-916, **Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort**, is a secondary weakness because the SHA512crypt password hashes may be vulnerable to brute-force attacks due to insufficient computational effort. This is implied by the vulnerability description stating that a local attacker could attempt off-line brute-force attacks against the exposed password hashes.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root causes and contributing factors described in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
