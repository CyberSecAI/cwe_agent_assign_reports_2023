## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **hard-coded cryptographic key** (CWE-321) used by the software. This leads to a compromise of the confidentiality of stored data.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis strongly pointed towards CWE-321, supported by the vulnerability description key phrases and retriever results. The final decision is based on the specific mention of a "**shared and hard-coded encryption key**" in the vulnerability description, making CWE-321 the most accurate and specific classification.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.81
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.81
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
To fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-836: Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product records password hashes in a data store, receives a hash of a password from a client, and compares the supplied hash to the hash obtained from the data store.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a one-way cryptographic hash against an input that should not be reversible, such as a password, but the product does not also use a salt as part of the input.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an algorithm or scheme that produces insufficient entropy, leaving patterns or clusters of values that are more likely to occur than others.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

### CWE Justifications

*   **CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key**
    *   **How the vulnerability's details match the CWE's characteristics:** The vulnerability description explicitly states the use of a "**shared and hard-coded encryption key**" to store data. This aligns perfectly with the CWE-321 description, which highlights the risks associated with using hard-coded cryptographic keys, specifically that "encrypted data may be recovered."
    *   **Security Implications and Potential Impact:** The **hard-coded key** allows unauthorized access to the encrypted data, leading to potential information disclosure and compromise of sensitive information.
    *   **Parent-Child Relationships:** CWE-321 is a variant of CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials), which in turn is a child of CWE-1391 (Use of Weak Credentials).
    *   **Whether the weakness is primary or secondary in the vulnerability:** This is the primary weakness.
    *   **How the official MITRE mapping guidance influenced your decision:** The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-321 states that it is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is preferred. It also advises to "Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit," which it is in this case.
    *   **Confidence:** 1.0

*   **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials**
    *   **How the vulnerability's details match the CWE's characteristics:** While CWE-321 is more
