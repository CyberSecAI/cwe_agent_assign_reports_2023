There is a parent relationship from CWE-862 to CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and also CWE-284. The other CWE that was strongly considered was CWE-668, since the lack of authorization leads to the exposure of resource to the wrong control sphere. CWE-668 is a Class and is discouraged. The relationship between CWE-862 and CWE-668 is that CWE-862 can PRECEDE CWE-668.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe862 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe668\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe668,cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with the **missing authorization** check (CWE-862). This leads to the **exposure of resource to the wrong sphere** (CWE-668), allowing attackers to obtain sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description states that the \"Jenkins Build-Publisher Plugin 1.22 and earlier **does not perform a permission check** in an HTTP endpoint.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section states that the **Root cause** is a \"Missing permission check in an HTTP endpoint\". This vulnerability allows \"attackers with Overall/Read permission to obtain names and URLs of Jenkins servers that the plugin is configured to publish builds to, as well as builds pending for publication to those Jenkins servers.\"\n\nCWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is a Class-level CWE whose description states: \"The product **does not perform an authorization check** when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\" This aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description.\n\nCWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) is a Class-level CWE whose description states: \"The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\" This is a consequence of the **missing authorization check**. MITRE discourages the usage of this CWE, since it is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead.\n\nI am confident that CWE-862 is the primary CWE for this vulnerability, with CWE-668 as a secondary consideration.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:",
