# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2022-28374

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CWE-78** | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| **CWE-184** | Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-78, which represents the core issue of injecting OS commands due to **improper input sanitization**. CWE-78 is a base-level CWE, providing a good level of specificity. CWE-184 (Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs) is related because the lack of complete sanitization implies an incomplete list of disallowed inputs.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper input sanitization** (CWE-78), leading to the ability to inject shell metacharacters. This results in remote code execution as root.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference. The core weakness is the **improper input sanitization** that allows for OS command injection.

The vulnerability description states: "Verizon 5G Home LVSKIHP OutDoorUnit (ODU) 3.33.101.0 **does not property sanitize user-controlled parameters** within the DMACC URLs on the Settings page of the Engineering portal. An authenticated remote attacker on the local network can inject shell metacharacters into /usr/lib/lua/5.1/luci/controller/admin/settings.lua to achieve remote code execution as root."

The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: "The ODU (Outdoor Unit) firmware (version 3.33.101.0) **fails to properly sanitize user-controlled parameters** within the DMACC URLs on the Engineering page... The lack of sanitization allows for the injection of shell metacharacters into the DMACC URL fields... By injecting malicious shell commands, an attacker can achieve remote code execution as the root user on the ODU device. This grants full control over the device."

CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command) is the most relevant CWE as it directly addresses the root cause of **improper input sanitization** leading to command injection.

CWE-184 (Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs) is also applicable because the sanitization is incomplete, implying an incomplete list of disallowed inputs.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-78 being a base-level CWE and CWE-184 providing additional context to the **improper sanitization**.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected:* While the CVE mentions the use of hardcoded credentials for accessing the engineering interface, this is a separate vulnerability and not the direct cause of the command injection.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

*Not Selected:* CWE-74 is a more general class. CWE-78 is a more specific base case.

## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* While the CVE mentions the use of hardcoded credentials for accessing the engineering interface, this is a separate vulnerability and not the direct cause of the command injection.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* Not relevant to the vulnerability.

## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected:* Not relevant to the vulnerability.

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* Not relevant to the vulnerability.

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected:* Not relevant to the vulnerability.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* Not relevant to the vulnerability.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level
