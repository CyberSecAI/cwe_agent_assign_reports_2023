CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). This indicates that CWE-862 is a more specific type of access control issue, focusing specifically on the **missing** authorization check. While CWE-284 could broadly apply, CWE-862 provides a more precise classification given the provided information. CWE-668 is a peer of CWE-285 and could be a secondary candidate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe862 --|PEEROF| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing permission check** (CWE-862), leading to local information disclosure. This is a direct cause-and-effect relationship.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly suggests CWE-862 due to the explicit mention of a \"**missing permission check**\" in the vulnerability description. The primary CWE match from similar CVE descriptions also points to CWE-862. While other CWEs like CWE-668 might seem relevant at first glance, they describe the consequence (information disclosure) rather than the root cause (**missing** authorization).\n\nThe evidence for CWE-862 is primarily based on the \"**rootcause: missing permission check**\" phrase within the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section.\n\nThe relationship graph reinforces the selection of CWE-862 because it\u2019s a specific type of access control issue. The abstraction level of CWE-862 as a Class is acceptable, but it is `Allowed-with-Review` because it might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate. However, there are no more specific CWEs that would be a better fit.\n\nCWE-668 is considered as a secondary weakness because the impact of the **missing permission check** is local information disclosure.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives a complex input with multiple elements or fields that must be consistent with each other, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually consistent.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive -
