It serves as a parent to more specific CWEs. The vulnerability involves exposing sensitive information, which leads to privilege escalation. Given the information exposure and subsequent privilege escalation, CWE-269 **Improper Privilege Management** is considered as a related weakness.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    \n    cwe269 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe269 secondary\n    class cwe284,cwe668 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **exposure of sensitive information**, which then leads to **privilege escalation**.\n\nExposure of Sensitive Information -> Improper Privilege Management -> Privilege Escalation\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-200 **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description key phrases and the CVE reference summary which states \"**Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** vulnerability\". The vulnerability allows an attacker with a guest account to escalate privileges in Apache ShardingSphere ElasticJob-UI.\n\nThe selection of CWE-200 is based on the evidence provided, which explicitly mentions the \"**Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**.\" The retriever results also listed CWE-200 as the top candidate with a similarity score of 0.362.\n\nThe analysis also considered that the exposure of sensitive information leads to privilege escalation, suggesting a secondary weakness related to privilege management. Therefore, CWE-269 **Improper Privilege Management** was identified as a secondary CWE.\n\nThe choice of CWE-200 is at the class level, while it's generally preferred to use base or variant levels, the evidence supports this classification. The MITRE mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-200. However, the description specifically states the **rootcause** as \"**Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**\" which is in line with CWE-200.\nThe evidence clearly points to an exposure issue, making CWE-200 a relevant despite the general discouragement.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
