# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2022-24382

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Discouraged |
| CWE-1256 | Improper Restriction of Software Interfaces to Hardware Features | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE identified is CWE-20 **Improper Input Validation**, which is a Class-level CWE. While it's discouraged to map directly to Class-level CWEs, the available information strongly points to this weakness as a contributing factor. The secondary CWE identified is CWE-1256 **Improper Restriction of Software Interfaces to Hardware Features**, which is a Base-level CWE, and a child of CWE-285.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20) which leads to potential escalation of privileges. The attacker is a privileged user with local access.
- **Root Cause**: CWE-20 **Improper Input Validation** in firmware.
- **Impact**: Escalation of Privilege.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified **Improper Input Validation** as the root cause, aligning with the description and key phrases. The Retriever Results also listed CWE-20 **Improper Input Validation** as a candidate, although it is discouraged due to its high-level Class abstraction. The description states "**Improper input validation** in firmware for some Intel(R) NUCs may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this: "**Root Cause:** Improper input validation in the firmware of some Intel NUCs."

The primary assessment is based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary. The graph relationships highlight that CWE-20 is a class-level weakness, and more specific child CWEs should be considered if available. However, based on the current evidence, a more specific CWE related to the type of input or validation is not apparent. I considered CWE-1256 because the vulnerability is in firmware for Intel NUCs, which could involve hardware features; however, the evidence only points to improper input validation, not specifically to issues with hardware interface restrictions, so I rated this as a secondary candidate.

The selected CWEs are at the most optimal level of specificity given the available evidence. While CWE-20 is a class, more specific details about the exact nature of the improper validation are not provided in the description.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
Not selected because there is no evidence to suggest that the input involves unsafe equivalence.

## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management
Not selected because the vulnerability is more directly related to input validation rather than control flow management.

## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
Not selected because the vulnerability focuses on input validation, not exceptional conditions.

## CWE-1173: Improper Use of Validation Framework
Not selected because the description doesn't specify whether a validation framework was used improperly or not used at all.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
Not selected because the description doesn't indicate that a security decision relies on untrusted inputs.
