## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-29457:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in the "schedule report" functionality of multiple ManageEngine applications (specifically identified as ADSelfService Plus, but also present in ADManager Plus, ADAudit Plus, and Exchange Reporter Plus). The applications allow users (with sufficient privileges) to specify a storage path for report exports. By manipulating this path to a network share (SMB server), the server hosting the ManageEngine application attempts to authenticate to the attacker-controlled SMB server using NTLMv2, leaking the NTLMv2 hash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the storage path provided by the user. Specifically, it doesn't restrict the use of UNC paths, which enables SMB redirection.
*   **Front-End Bypass:** Character restrictions on the storage path are only enforced by the front-end. These can be easily bypassed using a proxy tool like Burp Suite.
*  **NTLMv2 Hash Disclosure:** The server attempts NTLM authentication with an attacker controlled server exposing the hash over the network.
*   **SMB Authentication:** The applications use SMB for file sharing, making them vulnerable to NTLM relay attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **NTLMv2 Hash Capture:** An attacker can capture the NTLMv2 hash of the user account under which the ManageEngine application runs. This could be a domain user or the computer account.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**
    *   The captured NTLMv2 hash can be relayed to other servers in the Active Directory environment where SMB signing or LDAP signing is disabled. If the account has admin privileges, this can lead to full domain compromise.
    *  If the application runs as a service on a Domain Controller, the NTLMv2 hash of the Domain Controller can be captured and relayed to gain high privileges.
    *   If the compromised user has sufficient privileges, dumping local user hashes and remote command execution is possible.
*   **Lateral Movement**: If the application runs on a server, the attacker can leverage the captured hash to move laterally within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** An attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable server, where the application is installed, and to a controlled SMB server.
*   **SMB:** The attack leverages SMB protocol for authentication to an attacker controlled server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication to the application:** An attacker needs to have valid credentials to log in to the affected ManageEngine application. For some applications, this could be as low as operator/technician level credentials that have the "schedule report" functionality.
*   **SMB server:** The attacker needs to set up an SMB server to capture NTLMv2 hashes.
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable ManageEngine application server and the SMB server.
*   **NTLM Relay Tools:** The attacker needs to use tools such as `ntlmrelayx` to relay the captured NTLMv2 hash to other servers.
*   **Understanding of Active Directory:** Familiarity with NTLM relay techniques and Active Directory environments is beneficial.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in multiple ManageEngine products.
*   The vulnerability was patched in ADSelfService Plus build 6121.
*   The patch restricts the usage of UNC paths for non-admin users.
*   Admin users are still vulnerable even after the patch if they use UNC paths.
* The provided exploit code demonstrates how to leverage the vulnerability and is provided in the document.

- **CVE-2001-1483:** Enumeration of valid usernames based on inconsistent responses
- **CVE-2001-1528:** Account number enumeration via inconsistent responses.




## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

### Extended Description
Web applications susceptible to direct request attacks often make the false assumption that such resources can only be reached through a given navigation path and so only apply authorization at certain points in the path.

### Alternative Terms
forced browsing: The "forced browsing" term could be misinterpreted to include weaknesses such as CSRF or XSS, so its use is discouraged.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-862
ChildOf -> CWE-862
ChildOf -> CWE-288
ChildOf -> CWE-424
CanPrecede -> CWE-471
CanPrecede -> CWE-98

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Overlaps Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID), authorization errors, container errors; often primary to other weaknesses such as XSS and SQL injection.

**[Theoretical]** "Forced browsing" is a step-based manipulation involving the omission of one or more steps, whose order is assumed to be immutable. The application does not verify that the first step was performed successfully before the second step. The consequence is typically "authentication bypass" or "path disclosure," although it can be primary to all kinds of weaknesses, especially in languages such as PHP, which allow external modification of assumed-immutable variables.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29238:** Access-control setting in web-based document collaboration tool is not properly implemented by the code, which prevents listing hidden directories but does not prevent direct requests to files in those directories.
- **CVE-2022-23607:** Python-based HTTP library did not scope cookies to a particular domain such that "supercookies" could be sent to any domain on redirect.
- **CVE-2004-2144:** Bypass authentication via direct request.




## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1390
ChildOf -> CWE-287
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30018:** A messaging platform serializes all elements of User/Group objects, making private information available to adversaries
- **CVE-2022-29959:** Initialization file contains credentials that can be decoded using a "simple string transformation"
- **CVE-2022-35411:** Python-based RPC framework enables pickle functionality by default, allowing clients to unpickle untrusted data.




## CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly protect an assumed-immutable element from being modified by an attacker.

### Extended Description
This occurs when a particular input is critical enough to the functioning of the application that it should not be modifiable at all, but it is. Certain resources are often assumed to be immutable when they are not, such as hidden form fields in web applications, cookies, and reverse DNS lookups.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-664

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** MAID issues can be primary to many other weaknesses, and they are a major factor in languages that provide easy access to internal program constructs, such as PHP's register_globals and similar features. However, MAID issues can also be resultant from weaknesses that modify internal state; for example, a program might validate some data and store it in memory, but a buffer overflow could overwrite that validated data, leading to a change in program logic.

**[Theoretical]** There are many examples where the MUTABILITY property is a major factor in a vulnerability.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-1757:** Relies on $PHP_SELF variable for authentication.
- **CVE-2005-1905:** Gain privileges by modifying assumed-immutable code addresses that are accessed by a driver.




## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
XSPA: Cross Site Port Attack
SSRF: Server-Side Request Forgery

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-441
ChildOf -> CWE-610

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** CWE-918 (SSRF) and CWE-611 (XXE) are closely related, because they both involve web-related technologies and can launch outbound requests to unexpected destinations. However, XXE can be performed client-side, or in other contexts in which the software is not acting directly as a server, so the "Server" portion of the SSRF acronym does not necessarily apply.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-32786:** Chain: LLM integration framework has prompt injection (CWE-1427) that allows an attacker to force the service to retrieve data from an arbitrary URL, essentially providing SSRF (CWE-918) and potentially injecting content into downstream tasks.
- **CVE-2021-26855:** Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in mail server, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-21973:** Server Side Request Forgery in cloud platform, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-219: Storage of File with Sensitive Data Under Web Root
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product stores sensitive data under the web document root with insufficient access control, which might make it accessible to untrusted parties.

### Extended Description
Besides public-facing web pages and code, products may store sensitive data, code that is not directly invoked, or other files under the web document root of the web server. If the server is not configured or otherwise used to prevent direct access to those files, then attackers may obtain this sensitive data.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-552

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-1835:** Data file under web root.
- **CVE-2005-2217:** Data file under web root.
- **CVE-2002-1449:** Username/password in data file under web root.




## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Marshaling, Unmarshaling: Marshaling and unmarshaling are effectively synonyms for serialization and deserialization, respectively.
Pickling, Unpickling: In Python, the "pickle" functionality is used to perform serialization and deserialization.
PHP Object Injection: Some PHP application researchers use this term when attacking unsafe use of the unserialize() function; but it is also used for CWE-915.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-913
ChildOf -> CWE-913
PeerOf -> CWE-915

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between CWE-502 and CWE-915 need further exploration. CWE-915 is more narrowly scoped to object modification, and is not necessarily used for deserialization.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-12799:** chain: bypass of untrusted deserialization issue (CWE-502) by using an assumed-trusted class (CWE-183)
- **CVE-2015-8103:** Deserialization issue in commonly-used Java library allows remote execution.
- **CVE-2015-4852:** Deserialization issue in commonly-used Java library allows remote execution.
