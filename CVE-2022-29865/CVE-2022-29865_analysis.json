CWE-303 is a child of the Class level CWE-1390, Weak Authentication. CWE-1390 is a more general category, while CWE-303 pinpoints the specific flaw.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe303[\"CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe303 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe303 primary\n    class cwe1390 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **incorrect implementation of the authentication algorithm** (CWE-303). This leads to a **bypass of the application authentication check**, allowing a remote attacker to connect with crafted fake credentials. The impact is unauthorized access, potentially leading to data compromise or system manipulation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-303 as the primary root cause due to the **incorrect implementation of the authentication algorithm**. The vulnerability description states that a remote attacker can **bypass the application authentication check** using crafted fake credentials. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions \"Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm (CWE-303)\" and \"Bypass of application authentication mechanism.\"\n\nThe retriever results also listed CWE-303 as the top candidate with a high score. The CWE description precisely matches the vulnerability's root cause.\n\nCWE-1390, Weak Authentication, was considered as a secondary CWE since the **incorrect implementation** leads to a weakened authentication process. However, CWE-303 provides a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability's root cause.\n\nThe final decision to use CWE-303 as the primary CWE is based on the direct evidence from the vulnerability description, CVE reference links, retriever results, and the CWE's precise match to the root cause. CWE-303 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) as it accurately captures the **incorrect implementation of the authentication algorithm**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate",
