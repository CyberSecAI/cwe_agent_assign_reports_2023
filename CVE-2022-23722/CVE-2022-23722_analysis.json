CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) is a broader classification that encompasses various authentication weaknesses, including unverified password changes. It is a parent of CWE-620. CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) is considered because an existing user is able to reset another user's password which could be seen as bypassing authentication.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe620[\"CWE-620: Unverified Password Change\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n    \n    cwe620 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe288 -->|PEEROF| cwe620\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe620 primary\n    class cwe1390,cwe288 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **lack of proper verification** during the password reset process (CWE-620), leading to the ability for an existing user to reset another user's password, effectively **bypassing authentication** (CWE-288). This highlights a flaw in the authentication mechanism (CWE-1390).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is that the password reset mechanism **does not properly verify** the user's identity before allowing a password reset. This aligns directly with CWE-620's description: \"When setting a new password for a user, the product does not require knowledge of the original password, or using another form of authentication.\" The evidence from the vulnerability description is: \"When a password reset mechanism is configured to use the Authentication API with an Authentication Policy, email One-Time Password, PingID or SMS authentication, an existing user can reset another existing users password.\"\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-620 is a child of CWE-1390, indicating a more specific type of weak authentication. While CWE-1390 could be considered, CWE-620 provides a more precise classification of the vulnerability. CWE-288 is a peer of CWE-620 since the lack of password verification can also be seen as bypassing authentication since an existing user is able to reset another user's password.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the **root cause** of the vulnerability (CWE-620) and its broader implications (CWE-1390 and CWE-288). CWE-620 is the most specific and accurate representation of the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
