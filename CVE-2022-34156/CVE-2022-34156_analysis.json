CWE-295 is also a child of CWE-287 **Improper Authentication**. The Retriever Results and graph-based analysis also highlighted the relevance of CWE-295. Although CWE-300 describes the impact, it is a class-level CWE, and the guidance discourages its use when more specific, root-cause CWEs are available.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe295[\"CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\"]\n    cwe300[\"CWE-300: Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe295 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe300 -->|CHILDOF| cwe923[\"CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\"]\n    cwe923 -->|PARENTOF| cwe300\n    cwe295 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe300\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe295 primary\n    class cwe300 secondary\n    class cwe287,cwe923 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper verification of server certificates** (CWE-295), which allows an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack (CWE-300), leading to eavesdropping on encrypted communication.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis, based on the vulnerability description stating \"**improperly verifies server certificates**,\" strongly suggests CWE-295 **Improper Certificate Validation**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly identifies the application's failure to properly validate server certificates as CWE-295.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-295 can lead to CWE-300 **Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint**, but CWE-300 is a discouraged CWE due to its high level of abstraction. Therefore, CWE-295 is the primary and most specific CWE.\n\nThe selected CWE, CWE-295, is at the base level of specificity, aligning with MITRE's guidance to choose the lowest level that accurately represents the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product communicates with a host that provides a certificate, but the product does not properly ensure that the certificate is actually associated with that host.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n\n\n\n## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product violates well-established principles for secure design.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
