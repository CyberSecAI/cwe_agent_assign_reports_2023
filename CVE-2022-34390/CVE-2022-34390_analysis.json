The retriever results also suggest **CWE-456: Missing Initialization of a Variable** which can lead to **CWE-457**.

The description clearly states a \"**use of uninitialized variable** vulnerability.\" The CVE reference links confirm the root cause is \"**use of an uninitialized variable**.\" This aligns directly with **CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable**.\n\nThe graph relationships highlight that **CWE-457** is a variant, which is the preferred level of abstraction. **CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource** and **CWE-456: Missing Initialization of a Variable** were also considered, however, **CWE-457** best describes the specific vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n\n### Description\nThe code uses a variable that has not been initialized, leading to unpredictable or unintended results.\n\n### Extended Description\nIn some languages such as C and C++, stack variables are not initialized by default. They generally contain junk data with the contents of stack memory before the function was invoked. An attacker can sometimes control or read these contents. In other languages or conditions, a variable that is not explicitly initialized can be given a default value that has security implications, depending on the logic of the program. The presence of an uninitialized variable can sometimes indicate a typographic error in the code.\n\n## CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource\n**Abstraction:** Base\n\n### Description\nThe product uses or accesses a resource that has not been initialized.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a resource has not been properly initialized, the product may behave unexpectedly. This may lead to a crash or invalid memory access, but the consequences vary depending on the type of resource and how it is used within the product.\n\n## CWE-456: Missing Initialization of a Variable\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n\n### Description\nThe product does not initialize critical variables, which causes the execution environment to use unexpected values.\n\n**CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer** and **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation** were considered but are too general given the specific root cause identified. **CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write** could be a potential outcome of using the uninitialized variable, but the root cause is the uninitialized variable.",
