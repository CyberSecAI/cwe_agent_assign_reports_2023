This is the root cause and directly relates to CWE-1285 (Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input).\nThe primary weakness lies in the **improper validation**, leading to the impact of incorrect region mapping.\n\nThe retriever results also suggest CWE-1285 as a strong candidate.\n\nThe relationship analysis highlights that CWE-1285 is a child of CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), which is a more general class. Since the description is specific to memory region validation, CWE-1285 is the appropriate choice.\n\nThe final selection is based on the clear evidence from the vulnerability description and the supporting information from the retriever results and relationship analysis. CWE-1285 is at the optimal level of specificity, accurately representing the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as
