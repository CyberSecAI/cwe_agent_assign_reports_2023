Therefore, CWE-190 is the root cause, and CWE-123 is a consequence of that root cause. Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, making them suitable for direct mapping. CWE-190 can precede CWE-123, reflecting the vulnerability chain.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe123\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe123 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow** (CWE-190). This overflow results in the ability to write arbitrary values to arbitrary memory locations, leading to a **write-what-where** condition (CWE-123). Finally, this condition allows for the potential execution of arbitrary code.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-190 as the primary root cause due to the explicitly stated **integer overflow**. This is supported by the vulnerability description, which states \"A **write-what-where** condition in hermes caused by an **integer overflow**...\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section also highlights that the root cause is an integer overflow, which can be exploited to control memory addresses and write data. The retriever results also listed CWE-190 as the top combined result. The relationship diagram shows how the **integer overflow** can lead to a **write-what-where** condition. The selection of CWE-190 and CWE-123 is based directly on the evidence provided and their relationships within the vulnerability chain. These CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity (Base) and accurately represent the root cause and immediate consequence of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
