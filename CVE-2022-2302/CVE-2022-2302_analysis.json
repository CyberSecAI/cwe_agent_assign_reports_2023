It has hierarchical relationships with CWE-303 **Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm** and CWE-573. CWE-288 **Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel** is a peer and child of several CWEs. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-304 is the most appropriate base-level CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe304[\"CWE-304: Missing Critical Step in Authentication\"]\n    cwe303[\"CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\"]\n    cwe573[\"CWE-573: Improperly Implemented Security Check\"]\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe304 -->|CHILDOF| cwe303\n    cwe304 -->|CHILDOF| cwe573\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe288\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe304 primary\n    class cwe288,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing password verification upon second login** (CWE-304), leading to a remote attacker gaining full access without knowledge of the password. This can also be seen as an Authentication Bypass (CWE-288) due to the alternate login procedure that skips password verification. It can also be viewed as Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306) because the second login skips authentication.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **skipping password verification upon second login** as the key weakness. The retriever results suggested CWE-304 **Missing Critical Step in Authentication** as the top candidate, supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary which stated: \"The vulnerability is caused by a **missing password verification** step in the OPC-UA authentication process... Specifically, after a successful login, subsequent logins **skip password verification**, allowing unauthorized access.\"\n\nThe relationship analysis and the detailed CWE specifications confirmed that CWE-304 is the most accurate and specific classification. CWE-288 **Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel** and CWE-306 **Missing Authentication for Critical Function** are also applicable, but less specific.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the **missing step** in the authentication process (CWE-304), the resulting bypass (CWE-288), and the absence of authentication for a critical function (CWE-306).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product violates well-established principles for secure design.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
