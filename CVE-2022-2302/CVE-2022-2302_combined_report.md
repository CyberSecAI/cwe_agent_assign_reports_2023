## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **missing password verification upon second login** (CWE-304), leading to a remote attacker gaining full access without knowledge of the password. This can also be seen as an Authentication Bypass (CWE-288) due to the alternate login procedure that skips password verification. It can also be viewed as Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306) because the second login skips authentication.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified the **skipping password verification upon second login** as the key weakness. The retriever results suggested CWE-304 **Missing Critical Step in Authentication** as the top candidate, supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary which stated: "The vulnerability is caused by a **missing password verification** step in the OPC-UA authentication process... Specifically, after a successful login, subsequent logins **skip password verification**, allowing unauthorized access."

The relationship analysis and the detailed CWE specifications confirmed that CWE-304 is the most accurate and specific classification. CWE-288 **Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel** and CWE-306 **Missing Authentication for Critical Function** are also applicable, but less specific.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the **missing step** in the authentication process (CWE-304), the resulting bypass (CWE-288), and the absence of authentication for a critical function (CWE-306).

## Vulnerability Description
Multiple Lenze products of the cabinet series skip the password verification upon second login. After a user has been logged on to the device once, a remote attacker can get full access without knowledge of the password.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **skip password verification upon second login**
- **impact:** get full access without knowledge of password
- **attacker:** remote attacker
- **product:** Lenze products of the cabinet series

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2302:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a missing password verification step in the OPC-UA authentication process on Lenze machine controllers. Specifically, after a successful login, subsequent logins skip password verification, allowing unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Critical Step in Authentication (CWE-304):** The system fails to properly re-verify user credentials on subsequent login attempts after an initial successful authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain full access to the OPC-UA interface without needing valid credentials after an initial legitimate login.
- **Full control:** The attacker would be able to use the OPC UA interface to read/write data.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is conducted remotely over the network, exploiting the OPC-UA server.
- **Second login:** The attack relies on the fact that after one legitimate login, a second login can bypass password verification.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the affected Lenze device.
- **Initial access:** The attacker doesn't need initial credentials, but a successful login is required for the vulnerability to become exploitable.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is not in the OPC-UA protocol itself, but in the interface to the product's firmware.
- The vulnerability is only exploitable if user management is activated on the machine controller, the OPC-UA server is in use, and data is being transferred via a symbol configuration. These conditions are not enabled by default.
- The CVSS score is 9.8, indicating a critical severity with high impact.
- The affected versions are V01.07.00.2757 and prior versions for the cabinet c520, c550 and c750 models, and the fixed version is V01.08.01.3021

This content provides more detail than the basic CVE description, which simply states that it involves a missing step in authentication.

## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
According to WASC, "Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization."

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-672
ChildOf -> CWE-672
CanPrecede -> CWE-287

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.






## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.

- **CVE-2022-29951:** TCP-based protocol in Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) has no authentication.
- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.




## CWE-1393: Use of Default Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses default passwords for potentially critical functionality.

### Extended Description
It is common practice for products to be designed to use default passwords for authentication. The rationale is to simplify the manufacturing process or the system administrator's task of installation and deployment into an enterprise. However, if admins do not change the defaults, then it makes it easier for attackers to quickly bypass authentication across multiple organizations. There are many lists of default passwords and default-password scanning tools that are easily available from the World Wide Web.

### Alternative Terms

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-798
ChildOf -> CWE-798
ChildOf -> CWE-798

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The main difference between the use of hard-coded passwords and the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys is the false sense of security that the former conveys. Many people believe that simply hashing a hard-coded password before storage will protect the information from malicious users. However, many hashes are reversible (or at least vulnerable to brute force attacks) -- and further, many authentication protocols simply request the hash itself, making it no better than a password.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29960:** Engineering Workstation uses hard-coded cryptographic keys that could allow for unathorized filesystem access and privilege escalation
- **CVE-2022-30271:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used by default.
- **CVE-2020-10884:** WiFi router service has a hard-coded encryption key, allowing root access




## CWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product is composed of a server that relies on the client to implement a mechanism that is intended to protect the server.

### Extended Description
When the server relies on protection mechanisms placed on the client side, an attacker can modify the client-side behavior to bypass the protection mechanisms, resulting in potentially unexpected interactions between the client and server. The consequences will vary, depending on what the mechanisms are trying to protect.

### Alternative Terms
