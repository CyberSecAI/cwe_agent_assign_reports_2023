CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-787, specifying that the out-of-bounds write occurs in the heap. The other major relationship was that CWE-122 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-119 is a more general class of weakness, while CWE-122 specifies the location of the buffer (heap).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe122 primary\n    class cwe787,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **heap buffer overflow** and can lead to code execution or denial of service.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Heap buffer overflow** (CWE-122) due to improper handling of string operations.\n  - **Impact:** Code execution or denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points to a heap-based buffer overflow, as confirmed by the vulnerability description and the supporting evidence. The vulnerability occurs in the `mjs` JavaScript engine when processing JavaScript code involving `JSON.stringify` and `indexOf`, leading to an out-of-bounds write during string manipulation.\n\nThe evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section explicitly states: \"A **heap-buffer-overflow** occurs within the `mjs` JavaScript engine when processing a specific JavaScript code snippet involving `JSON.stringify` and `indexOf`. The overflow happens during the string search operation (`mg_strstr`).\"\n\nThe retriever results also support this classification, with CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) being a relevant candidate.\n\nBased on this evidence, I am confident that CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability. It is a variant-level CWE, providing sufficient specificity and aligning well with the provided vulnerability details.\n\nCWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) was considered, but it is a more general class of weakness. Since the vulnerability is specifically a heap-based buffer overflow, CWE-122 is a more precise and appropriate classification.\n\nCWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) was also considered, but it does not directly describe the buffer overflow. While integer overflows can sometimes lead to buffer overflows, the primary weakness in this case is the heap buffer overflow itself.\nCWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) was considered, but the description mentions an out-of-bounds write which means the correct mapping should be CWE-122.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially
