CWE-259 (**Use of Hard-coded Password**) is a variant of CWE-798, representing a more specific case. CWE-1390 (**Weak Authentication**) is a class that CWE-798 can fall under. CWE-384 (**Session Fixation**) can be caused by **improper** generation of session tokens. The relationships between these CWEs help to refine the classification based on the available information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe384[\"CWE-384: Session Fixation\"]\n\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe384 -->|REQUIRES| cwe472[\"CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Data\"]\n    cwe384 -->|REQUIRES| cwe346[\"CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\"]\n    cwe384 -->|REQUIRES| cwe441[\"CWE-441: Unintended Proxy or Intermediary\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe798 primary\n    class cwe259,cwe1390,cwe384 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of hard-coded credentials** (CWE-798) or a **null/empty hash** for the guest user. This allows an attacker to **self-sign session cookies**, leading to **authentication bypass** and the ability to **login as guest**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the vulnerability description indicating that an attacker can **self-sign session cookies** by knowing the target's MAC address and the user's password hash, and guest users can be abused using a null/empty hash. The retriever results pointed to CWE-798 (**Use of Hard-coded Credentials**) and CWE-259 (**Use of Hard-coded Password**), as well as CWE-1390 (**Weak Authentication**) and CWE-384 (**Session Fixation**).\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary reveals the application uses a weak custom encryption function (`tos_encrypt_str`) with a **hardcoded key** to generate session tokens, allowing an attacker to craft a valid session token for any user, especially the guest user which by default has a null password hash. Given the root cause is the **use of hard-coded credentials** for session token generation, CWE-798 is the most appropriate primary classification.\n\nCWE-259 (**Use of Hard-coded Password**) is a more specific variant of CWE-798, but since the credentials are used to sign cookies, it is not exactly a password, so CWE-798 is still better.\n\nCWE-384 (**Session Fixation**) is also considered because the attacker is effectively fixing the session by crafting the cookies. However, the root cause is the **hard-coded key** and **null password hash**, not the session fixation itself.\n\nCWE-1390 (**Weak Authentication**) is a general class, and a more specific CWE is preferred, so CWE-798 is a better fit.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately reflect the underlying weaknesses contributing to the vulnerability. CWE-798 directly addresses the **use of hard-coded credentials**, while CWE-259 and CWE-384 provide additional context.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n## Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThis attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:",
