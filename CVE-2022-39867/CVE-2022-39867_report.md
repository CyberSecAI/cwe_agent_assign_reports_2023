# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2022-39867

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-925 | Improper Verification of Intent by Broadcast Receiver | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 0.7 | Pillar | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-925, which is a Variant of CWE-940 (Improperly Transmitted Message). CWE-284 is a high-level Pillar that is generally discouraged, but it reflects the high-level nature of the **improper access control** issue. The variant CWE-925 is more specific and deals directly with improper intent verification in Broadcast Receivers.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is as follows:
1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper access control** in `cloudNotificationManager.java` due to **improper verification of intent**.
2.  **Attack Vector:** Exploitation of `SHOW_PERSISTENT_BANNER` broadcast.
3.  **Impact:** Attackers can access sensitive information.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on the **improper access control** vulnerability reported in the `cloudNotificationManager.java` file of the SmartThings application. The key evidence supporting this assessment is the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** which states "**rootcause:** **Improper access control**" and "**impact:** access sensitive information via SHOW_PERSISTENT_BANNER broadcast".

The primary CWE match from similar CVE descriptions was CWE-NVD-Other, which is too generic. The top CWEs included CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere), which is a Class-level CWE and discouraged for use. The Retriever Results suggested CWE-925 (Improper Verification of Intent by Broadcast Receiver) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).

CWE-284 is a Pillar-level CWE, and the guidance discourages its use because it's too high-level and not useful for trend analysis. The retriever suggests more specific descendants of CWE-284. CWE-925 is a Variant-level CWE that deals specifically with the improper verification of intent by a broadcast receiver, which aligns well with the vulnerability description mentioning the `SHOW_PERSISTENT_BANNER` broadcast and the CVE reference links content summary that discusses the handling of implicit broadcasts.

Therefore, CWE-925 is chosen as the primary CWE because it accurately captures the **root cause** of the vulnerability (improper intent verification) at the appropriate level of specificity (Variant). CWE-284 is retained as a secondary CWE to acknowledge the high-level **improper access control** issue, although it is generally discouraged.

The evidence provided supports this conclusion, and the relationship analysis confirms that CWE-925 is a more specific representation of the vulnerability than the more generic CWE-284.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as "/abs/path" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-29: Path Traversal: '\..\filename'
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize '\..\filename' (leading backslash dot dot) sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-24: Path Traversal: '../filedir'
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize "../" sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an externally controlled name or reference that resolves to a resource that is outside of the intended control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes
