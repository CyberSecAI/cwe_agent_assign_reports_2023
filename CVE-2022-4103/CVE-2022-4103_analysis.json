CWE-352 (CSRF) and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) are related, both stemming from inadequate security measures. CWE-352 is a compound CWE that requires multiple conditions to be met, while CWE-862 is a class-level CWE. The choice to include both reflects the multiple security failures.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n    class cwe285 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with **missing authorization and CSRF checks**, leading to the impact of authenticated users being able to create arbitrary posts with arbitrary titles.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **missing authorization and CSRF checks** as the root cause. The retriever results and the vulnerability description key phrases both strongly support this assessment. The selection of CWE-352 and CWE-862 is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary, which explicitly mention the **lack of authorization and CSRF protection**. The hierarchical relationships and mapping guidance were considered to ensure the selection of the most appropriate and specific CWEs.\n\nThe vulnerability description states, \"The Royal Elementor Addons WordPress plugin before 1.3.56 **does not have authorisation and CSRF checks** when creating a template, and does not ensure that the post created is a template. This could allow any authenticated users, such as subscriber to create a post (as well as any post type) with an arbitrary title.\"\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary states, \"The plugin lacks authorization and CSRF checks when creating a template, and does not validate that the created post is a template.\"\n\nThese quotes demonstrate that the assessment is based on the provided evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
