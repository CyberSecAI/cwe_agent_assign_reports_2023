## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that impacted my decision was the parent-child relationship between CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). CWE-862 and CWE-863 are children of CWE-285. The vulnerability description clearly indicates a **missing permission check**, which aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-862.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events in this vulnerability is as follows:

1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing authorization** check in the Publish Over FTP Plugin.
2.  **Vulnerability:** Attackers with Overall/Read permissions can bypass intended access restrictions.
3.  **Impact:** Attackers can connect to an FTP server using attacker-specified credentials.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which the description clearly states as **missing permission checks**. This strongly suggests CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). The retriever results also list CWE-862 as the top candidate.

The evidence from the vulnerability description includes:
*   "**Missing permission checks** in Jenkins Publish Over FTP Plugin 1.16 and earlier"
*   "The Publish Over FTP Plugin does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation."

The mapping guidance for CWE-862 suggests reviewing child entries for a better fit. However, none of the child entries of CWE-862 are more appropriate than CWE-862 itself.

CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) was considered because the attacker uses attacker-specified credentials, but the root cause is not a user-controlled key, but the missing permission check. Thus, CWE-639 is a possible, but not as likely.

Therefore, CWE-862 is the most accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability.

## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description


Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.


When access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.


### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.
**Reasons:**

- **CVE-2002-1713:** Home directories installed world-readable.
- **CVE-2001-1550:** World-writable log files allow information loss; world-readable file has cleartext passwords.




## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.


Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.


When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to "sniff" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29519:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends sensitive information in plaintext, including passwords and session tokens.
- **CVE-2022-30312:** Building Controller uses a protocol that transmits authentication credentials in plaintext.
- **CVE-2022-31204:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends password in plaintext.




## CWE-549: Missing Password Field Masking
