Because the hashing mechanism does not rely on a server-supplied key, it is possible for an attacker with sufficient network access to capture the hashed password of a logged on user and use it in a classic Pass-the-Hash style attack.|\n| CWE-916 | Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate.
