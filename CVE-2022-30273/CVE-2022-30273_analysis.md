# Analysis for CVE-2022-30273

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-327 | Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm | 1.0 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-649 | Reliance on Obfuscation or Encryption of Security-Relevant Inputs without Integrity Checking | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is that CWE-327 is a class-level CWE that describes the use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm. The vulnerability description clearly states that the Motorola MDLC protocol uses TEA in ECB mode, which is a known weak cryptographic algorithm. CWE-649 is also related, as it discusses the reliance on encryption without integrity checking, which is a direct consequence of using ECB mode.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **mishandling of message integrity** due to the use of a weak cryptographic algorithm (TEA in ECB mode), which leads to the lack of message integrity and reduced confidentiality. This then exposes the system to potential message manipulation and other attacks.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis correctly identifies CWE-327 as a strong candidate due to the **mishandling of message integrity** using a weak algorithm TEA in ECB mode. The vulnerability description highlights that ECB mode "does not offer message integrity and offers reduced confidentiality." The Retriever results also listed CWE-327 as the top candidate. The supporting evidence from the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms that the root cause is the use of TEA in ECB mode, which is a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm.

CWE-649 is also included because ECB mode lacks integrity checks, allowing for potential message modification.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-327 is a Class, but there isn't a more specific Base CWE that completely captures the **mishandling of message integrity** aspect by employing a risky algorithm, and the CWE description also contains `SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity`. CWE-649 adds the additional context of relying on encryption without integrity checking, which is directly relevant to the vulnerability.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
To fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-649: Reliance on Obfuscation or Encryption of Security-Relevant Inputs without Integrity Checking
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses obfuscation or encryption of inputs that should not be mutable by an external actor, but the product does not use integrity checks to detect if those inputs have been modified.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product violates well-established principles for secure design.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.
