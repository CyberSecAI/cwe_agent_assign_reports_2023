|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-835 | Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-409 | Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data (Data Amplification) | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-674 | Uncontrolled Recursion | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-835, which describes an infinite loop due to an unreachable exit condition. This is a base-level CWE that directly matches the vulnerability description. CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion) and CWE-409 (Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data) were considered as secondary candidates due to the recursive nature of the decompression and the data amplification aspect, respectively. However, CWE-835 is the most specific and accurate representation of the core weakness. The relationship between CWE-674 as a parent of CWE-834 (which in turn is a parent to CWE-835) highlights the broader category of control flow issues that can lead to infinite loops.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper** handling of gzipped files by the phar uncompressor. Specifically, the application **fails to** limit recursion when decompressing files. A crafted "quine" gzip file (a file that contains itself in compressed form) triggers recursive decompression, leading to an **infinite loop** and denial of service.
  - Root Cause: **Improper** handling of compressed data and **missing** recursion limit.
  - Weakness: Infinite recursion.
  - Impact: Denial of service.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the denial-of-service vulnerability in the PHP phar uncompressor. The evidence strongly suggests that the application's **failure to** limit recursion depth when decompressing gzipped files is the core issue.

The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" explicitly states the "**root_cause**" as: "The vulnerability arises from the phar wrapper's behavior when processing gzipped files...the wrapper will recursively try to decompress it again. This can lead to an **infinite loop** and subsequent denial-of-service condition."

The "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" also highlights the "**impact:** infinite loop" and "**vector:** recursively uncompress quines gzip files".

Based on the evidence, CWE-835 (Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')) is the most accurate and specific CWE. It directly addresses the core weakness of the vulnerability.

CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion) was considered because the vulnerability involves recursive decompression. However, CWE-835 is more precise because it specifies the "infinite loop" condition, which is the actual symptom of the vulnerability.

CWE-409 (Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data) was also considered, as the "quine" gzip file can be seen as a form of data amplification. However, the core issue is not the size of the decompressed data but the infinite loop caused by recursive decompression.

The relationships between these CWEs helped refine the selection. CWE-674 is a parent of CWE-834, which in turn is a parent of CWE-835, indicating a hierarchical relationship from general recursion issues to specific infinite loop conditions.

The selection of CWE-835 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly matches the vulnerability's core weakness and impact, and it is a base-level CWE, which is preferred for root cause analysis.

Other CWEs Considered:
- CWE-22, CWE-23, CWE-73: These CWEs relate to path traversal, which is not relevant to this vulnerability. The issue is with file decompression, not file path handling.
- CWE-502: This CWE relates to deserialization, which is not applicable here. The vulnerability is about decompression, not object deserialization.
- CWE-434: This CWE relates to unrestricted file uploads, which is not directly relevant. The vulnerability lies in how uploaded files are processed, not the upload itself.
- CWE-776: This CWE relates to XML entity expansion, which is specific to XML processing and not relevant to gzip decompression.

- **CVE-2016-10707:** Javascript application accidentally changes input in a way that prevents a recursive call from detecting an exit condition.




## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

### Extended Description


Many file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as ".." and "/" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the "../" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as "/usr/local/bin" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.


### Alternative Terms
Directory traversal
Path traversal: "Path traversal" is preferred over "directory traversal," but both terms are attack-focused.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-706
ChildOf -> CWE-706
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add ".txt" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.

**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.

**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing "/" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).

**[Terminology]** 

Like other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use "directory traversal" only to refer to the injection of ".." and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.


Other variants like "absolute pathname" and "drive letter" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve ".." or equivalent.


**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.

**[Research Gap]** 

Incomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that "..\" is vulnerable, but not test "../" which may also be vulnerable.


Any combination of directory separators ("/", "\", etc.) and numbers of "." (e.g. "....") can produce unique variants; for example, the "//../" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama
- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the "\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)




## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Marshaling, Unmarshaling: Marshaling and unmarshaling are effectively synonyms for serialization and deserialization, respectively.
Pickling, Unpickling: In Python, the "pickle" functionality is used to perform serialization and deserialization.
PHP Object Injection: Some PHP application researchers use this term when attacking unsafe use of the unserialize() function; but it is also used for CWE-915.

### Relationships

ChildOf -> CWE-913
PeerOf -> CWE-915

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between CWE-502 and CWE-915 need further exploration. CWE-915 is more narrowly scoped to object modification, and is not necessarily used for deserialization.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-12799:** chain: bypass of untrusted deserialization issue (CWE-502) by using an assumed-trusted class (CWE-183)
- **CVE-2015-8103:** Deserialization issue in commonly-used Java library allows remote execution.
- **CVE-2015-4852:** Deserialization issue in commonly-used Java library allows remote execution.




## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Unrestricted File Upload: Used in vulnerability databases and elsewhere, but it is insufficiently precise. The phrase could be interpreted as the lack of restrictions on the size or number of uploaded files, which is a resource consumption issue.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-669
ChildOf -> CWE-669
PeerOf -> CWE-351
PeerOf -> CWE-436
PeerOf -> CWE-430

### Mapping Guidance

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

This can have a chaining relationship with incomplete denylist / permissive allowlist errors when the product tries, but fails, to properly limit which types of files are allowed (CWE-183, CWE-184).


This can also overlap multiple interpretation errors for intermediaries, e.g. anti-virus products that do not remove or quarantine attachments with certain file extensions that can be processed by client systems.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-5227:** PHP-based FAQ management app does not check the MIME type for uploaded images
- **CVE-2001-0901:** Web-based mail product stores ".shtml" attachments that could contain SSI
- **CVE-2002-1841:** PHP upload does not restrict file types




## CWE-409: Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data (Data Amplification)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles a compressed input with a very high compression ratio that produces a large output.

### Extended Description
An example of data amplification is a "decompression bomb," a small ZIP file that can produce a large amount of data when it is decompressed.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-405

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2009-1955:** XML bomb in web server module
- **CVE-2003-1564:** Parsing library allows XML bomb




## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

### Extended Description


This could allow an attacker to access or modify system files or other files that are critical to the application.


Path manipulation errors occur when the following two conditions are met:

```
		1. An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.
		2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.
```
For example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker.

### Alternative Terms

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** CWE-114 is a Class, but it is listed a child of CWE-73 in view 1000. This suggests some abstraction problems that should be resolved in future versions.

**[Relationship]** 

The external control of filenames can be the primary link in chains with other file-related weaknesses, as seen in the CanPrecede relationships. This is because software systems use files for many different purposes: to execute programs, load code libraries, to store application data, to store configuration settings, record temporary data, act as signals or semaphores to other processes, etc.


However, those weaknesses do not always require external control. For example, link-following weaknesses (CWE-59) often involve pathnames that are not controllable by the attacker at all.


The external control can be resultant from other issues. For example, in PHP applications, the register_globals setting can allow an attacker to modify variables that the programmer thought were immutable, enabling file inclusion (CWE-98) and path traversal (CWE-22). Operating with excessive privileges (CWE-250) might allow an attacker to specify an input filename that is not directly readable by the attacker, but is accessible to the privileged program. A buffer overflow (CWE-119) might give an attacker control over nearby memory locations that are related to pathnames, but were not directly modifiable by the attacker.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)
- **CVE-2008-5748:** Chain: external control of values for user's desired language and theme enables path traversal.
- **CVE-2008-5764:** Chain: external control of user's target language enables remote file inclusion.




## CWE-776: Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses XML documents and allows their structure to be defined with a Document Type Definition (DTD), but it does not properly control the number of recursive definitions of entities.

### Extended Description
If the DTD contains a large number of nested or recursive entities, this can lead to explosive growth of data when parsed, causing a denial of service.

### Alternative Terms
XEE: XEE is the acronym commonly used for XML Entity Expansion.
Billion Laughs Attack
XML Bomb: While the "XML Bomb" term was used in the early years of knowledge of this issue, the XEE term seems to be more commonly used.

## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

### Extended Description
This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.

### Alternative Terms
Zip Slip: "Zip slip" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282]. It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).

- **CVE-2019-20916:** Python package manager does not correctly restrict the filename specified in a Content-Disposition header, allowing arbitrary file read using path traversal sequences such as "../"




## CWE-281: Improper Preservation of Permissions
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not preserve permissions or incorrectly preserves permissions when copying, restoring, or sharing objects, which can cause them to have less restrictive permissions than intended.
