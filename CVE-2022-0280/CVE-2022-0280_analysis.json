CWE-367 is a ChildOf CWE-362 and represents a specific type of **race condition**, where the state of a resource is checked and then used, but the state can change in between. CWE-59 can result from a **race condition** and is often related to symlink issues. CWE-1386 is a child of CWE-59 and describes insecure operations on Windows junctions and mount points, which can be exploited via **race conditions**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe59[\"CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\"]\n    cwe1386[\"CWE-1386: Insecure Operation on Windows Junction / Mount Point\"]\n\n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    cwe367 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe59\n    cwe1386 -->|CHILDOF| cwe59\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe367,cwe59,cwe1386 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition** (CWE-362), specifically a Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability (CWE-367). This **race condition** enables an attacker to replace a file with a symbolic link (CWE-59). The insecure handling of the symlink leads to arbitrary file deletion, potentially causing denial of service and privilege elevation. In a Windows environment, this might involve insecure operations on junctions/mount points (CWE-1386).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability involves a **race condition** in the QuickClean feature of McAfee Total Protection. The core issue is that the product doesn't properly synchronize access to shared resources during file operations, allowing a local user to exploit a **race condition** to create symlinks and delete arbitrary files.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')), as the vulnerability stems from **improper synchronization** in a concurrent environment. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a \"**race condition**,\" making CWE-362 the most appropriate high-level classification.\n\nCWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition) is also relevant because the attacker likely exploits a time window between when the product checks the state of a file and when it uses that file.\n\nCWE-59 (Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')) is applicable since the attack exploits symlinks. The product fails to prevent the filename from resolving to an unintended resource.\n\nCWE-1386 (Insecure Operation on Windows Junction / Mount Point) is also relevant as the exploit involves symlinks on a Windows system, suggesting the possibility of exploiting Windows junctions or mount points.\n\nWhile CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management) and CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) were considered, they were deemed less relevant as the root cause is the **race condition**, not a direct issue with privilege management or permission assignment. Similarly, CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is too generic.\n\nThe selection of CWE-362 as the primary CWE, with CWE-367, CWE-59, and CWE-1386 as secondary CWEs, provides a comprehensive and specific representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
