Its relationships include ChildOf relationships to CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management) and CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime), and CanPrecede relationships to CWE-416 (Use After Free) and CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference). The secondary CWE is CWE-537, a Variant, and a ChildOf to CWE-211 (Information Exposure Through Standard Error). The retriever results pointed to CWE-362 as the best fit, and the vulnerability description mentioned \"race condition\", which aligns perfectly with CWE-362's definition.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe691[\"CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management\"]\n    cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\"]\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe537[\"CWE-537: Java Runtime Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe211[\"CWE-211: Information Exposure Through Standard Error\"]\n\n    cwe362 -->|ChildOf| cwe691\n    cwe362 -->|ChildOf| cwe664\n    cwe362 -->|CanPrecede| cwe416\n    cwe362 -->|CanPrecede| cwe476\n    cwe537 -->|ChildOf| cwe211\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe537 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events begins with a **race condition** (CWE-362) due to **improper synchronization** within the `vow` component. This leads to **information disclosure**.\n  - Root Cause: CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'))\n  - Impact: Information disclosure\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points towards CWE-362 due to the explicit mention of a **race condition** in the vulnerability description and supporting CVE reference links. The vulnerability description states: \"In vow, there is a possible information disclosure due to a **race condition**.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating the root cause as \"**improper synchronization** in the `vow` component leading to a race condition\" and the presence of a \"Race condition\" as a weakness.\n\nWhile CWE-362 is a Class, the provided information doesn't provide sufficient detail to pinpoint a more specific Base or Variant. The mapping guidance for CWE-362 suggests examining children for a better fit, but none of the children CWEs are a better fit based on the description.\n\nCWE-537 (Java Runtime Error Message Containing Sensitive Information) was considered because the vulnerability results in information disclosure. However, it is less directly related to the root cause, which is the **race condition**. The connection is that the race condition *could* potentially lead to sensitive information being exposed in an error message, but this is not explicitly stated. Therefore, CWE-537 is considered a secondary, less confident mapping.\n\nCWE-662 (Improper Synchronization) and CWE-667 (Improper Locking) were also considered because the root cause was described as **improper synchronization**. While **improper synchronization** is likely the reason for the **race condition**, CWE-362 is a better fit because it is more specific, and **race condition** is explicitly mentioned.\n\nThe final decision is to assign CWE-362 as the primary CWE, representing the **race condition** due to **improper synchronization**, with CWE-537 as a secondary consideration due to the resulting information disclosure, even though the evidence for this is weak.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
