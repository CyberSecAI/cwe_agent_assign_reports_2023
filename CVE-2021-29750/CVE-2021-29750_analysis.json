However, without more detailed information about the specific algorithm used, remaining at the class level is appropriate. CWE-327 is a child of CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure) indicating a failure in implementing a security mechanism. It also has a PeerOf relationship with CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n\n    cwe327 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe327 --|PEEROF| cwe311\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe327 primary\n    class cwe693,cwe311 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms** (CWE-327), which leads to the potential ability to decrypt highly sensitive information. The root cause is the selection and implementation of a weak cryptographic algorithm.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability description indicates the **use of weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms**, which directly corresponds to CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating that the root cause is the **use of weak cryptographic algorithms**.\n\nThe primary CWE match from similar CVE descriptions also points to CWE-327. The retriever results list CWE-327 as a strong candidate, but also considers CWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength).\n\nCWE-327 is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly states the **use of weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms**. While CWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength) could also apply, CWE-327 is a slightly better fit as it encompasses broken or risky algorithms, not just those with inadequate strength.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description, the CVE reference links, and the retriever results all support the selection of CWE-327. While a more specific CWE could exist if the exact algorithm was known, the information provided is insufficient to narrow it down further.\n\nCWE-326 was considered as a secondary candidate because it is closely related and also reflects the use of a less-than-ideal encryption approach.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
