This aligns with the evidence presented in the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary, which explicitly mentions the lack of sanitization leading to OS command execution.\n\nThe decision is based on direct evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section: \"The vulnerability stems from the application reading values from a YAML file and directly concatenating them into an `os.system` call.
