This means that an integer overflow can lead to memory corruption issues like out-of-bounds writes.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    \n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow** (**CWE-190**), which leads to heap corruption. Heap corruption often manifests as an **out-of-bounds write** (**CWE-787**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the **root cause** is an **integer overflow** in Mojo within Google Chrome. This aligns perfectly with **CWE-190** [Integer Overflow or Wraparound]. The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** also confirms \"Integer overflow\" as the root cause of the vulnerability. The **impact** of the overflow is potential heap corruption, which could lead to an **out-of-bounds write** (**CWE-787**).\n\nThe **CWE for similar CVE Descriptions** section lists **CWE-190** [Integer Overflow or Wraparound] as the primary CWE match, further solidifying the classification.\n\nThe retriever results also show **CWE-190** [Integer Overflow or Wraparound] as the top combined result with a score of 0.800.\n\nWhile **CWE-787** [Out-of-bounds Write] is a possible consequence of the overflow leading to heap corruption, the description focuses on the **integer overflow** as the root cause. Therefore, **CWE-190** [Integer Overflow or Wraparound] is the primary CWE and **CWE-787** [Out-of-bounds Write] can be considered a secondary candidate.\n\nI am selecting **CWE-190** [Integer Overflow or Wraparound] as the primary CWE because the description explicitly identifies it as the **root cause**. I am also including **CWE-787** [Out-of-bounds Write] as a secondary candidate because the overflow leads to heap corruption which often manifests as an out-of-bounds write.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not selected:\n\n*   **CWE-416** [Use After Free]: While heap corruption can sometimes lead to use-after-free vulnerabilities, the description does not directly mention memory being freed and then reused.\n*   **CWE-122** [Heap-based Buffer Overflow]: While heap corruption is mentioned, the root cause is the integer overflow, not directly a buffer overflow.\n*   **CWE-843** [Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')]: There is no mention of incompatible types being used to access resources.\n*   **CWE-191** [Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)]: The description specifies an *overflow*, not an underflow.\n*   **CWE-451** [User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information]: This vulnerability doesn't involve UI misrepresentation.\n*   **CWE-123** [Write-what-where Condition]: While this *could* be the impact of the heap corruption, it is not explicitly stated.\n*   **CWE-366** [Race Condition within a Thread]: No mention of race conditions.\n*   **CWE-415** [Double Free]: No mention of double freeing memory.",
