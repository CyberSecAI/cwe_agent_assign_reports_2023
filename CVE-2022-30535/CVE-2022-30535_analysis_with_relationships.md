*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship considered was the parent-child relationship between CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) and its potential children. The analysis also considered how CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) fits into the broader context of information security weaknesses. The abstraction levels were assessed to find the most specific, yet accurate, representation of the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events starts with an attacker authorized to create or update ingress objects. Due to **improper access control**, the attacker can then obtain secrets available to the NGINX Ingress Controller, leading to **exposure of sensitive information**. The root cause is the **improper access control**, and the impact is the **exposure of sensitive information**.

## Summary of Analysis
Initially, several CWEs were considered based on the vulnerability description and retriever results, including CWE-400, CWE-732, CWE-269, CWE-863, CWE-290 and CWE-522. However, after careful analysis and consideration of the mapping guidance, CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) were selected as the most appropriate.

The vulnerability description indicates that an attacker with certain privileges (authorized to create/update ingress objects) can obtain secrets, which are sensitive information. This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-200: "The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information."

The retriever results also suggested CWE-200, although it is generally discouraged, in this case, it accurately reflects the impact of the vulnerability. The fact that an authorized user can obtain secrets indicates a problem with access control, leading to the selection of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) as a secondary CWE.

The graph relationships and mapping guidance influenced the decision by highlighting the importance of selecting the most specific CWE possible. While CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE and is discouraged, it accurately represents the impact of the vulnerability and is supported by the evidence.

The final selection of CWEs is based on the provided evidence, the retriever results, and the mapping guidance. The selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, accurately represent the vulnerability, and are supported by the available information.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Rationale for not selecting*: This vulnerability is not related to unsafe equivalence in input.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Rationale for not selecting*: This vulnerability is not directly related to reliance on untrusted inputs.

## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Rationale for not selecting*: This vulnerability is not related to server-side request forgery.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

*Rationale for not selecting*: This vulnerability is not related to injection.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

*Rationale for not selecting*: While related, CWE-668 is too general and CWE-200 is a more specific representation of the vulnerability.

## CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an externally controlled name or reference that resolves to a resource that is outside of the intended control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

*Rationale for not selecting*: This vulnerability is not related to externally controlled references.

## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Rationale for not selecting*: This vulnerability is not related to interaction frequency.

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Rationale for not selecting*: This vulnerability is not related to sensitive information not removed before reuse.

## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives data from an HTTP agent/component
