The analysis also considered how CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) fits into the broader context of information security weaknesses. The abstraction levels were assessed to find the most specific, yet accurate, representation of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe284 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with an attacker authorized to create or update ingress objects. Due to **improper access control**, the attacker can then obtain secrets available to the NGINX Ingress Controller, leading to **exposure of sensitive information**. The root cause is the **improper access control**, and the impact is the **exposure of sensitive information**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, several CWEs were considered based on the vulnerability description and retriever results, including CWE-400, CWE-732, CWE-269, CWE-863, CWE-290 and CWE-522. However, after careful analysis and consideration of the mapping guidance, CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) were selected as the most appropriate.\n\nThe vulnerability description indicates that an attacker with certain privileges (authorized to create/update ingress objects) can obtain secrets, which are sensitive information. This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-200: \"The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\"\n\nThe retriever results also suggested CWE-200, although it is generally discouraged, in this case, it accurately reflects the impact of the vulnerability. The fact that an authorized user can obtain secrets indicates a problem with access control, leading to the selection of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) as a secondary CWE.\n\nThe graph relationships and mapping guidance influenced the decision by highlighting the importance of selecting the most specific CWE possible. While CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE and is discouraged, it accurately represents the impact of the vulnerability and is supported by the evidence.\n\nThe final selection of CWEs is based on the provided evidence, the retriever results, and the mapping guidance. The selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, accurately represent the vulnerability, and are supported by the available information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Rationale for not selecting*: This vulnerability is not related to unsafe equivalence in input.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Rationale for not selecting*: This vulnerability is not directly related to reliance on untrusted inputs.\n\n## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Rationale for not selecting*: This vulnerability is not related to server-side request forgery.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*Rationale for not selecting*: This vulnerability is not related to injection.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
