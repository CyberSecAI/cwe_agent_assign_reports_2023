CWE-787 indicates the out-of-bounds write, and CWE-119 is a more general class describing improper memory buffer restrictions. The relationship highlights that the vulnerability is a specific type of out-of-bounds write that occurs on the stack. Choosing CWE-121 provides the most accurate and specific classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe787,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  The application has **stack-based buffer overflows**.\n2.  An authenticated attacker sends specially crafted requests to trigger the overflow.\n3.  The overflow leads to arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment correctly identified **stack-based buffer overflows** as the root cause, aligning with CWE-121. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"stack-based buffer overflows,\" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this. The retriever results also list CWE-121 as a strong candidate.\n\nThe selection of CWE-121 is based on the following evidence:\n\n*   The vulnerability description states: \"Multiple **stack-based buffer overflows** in the API controllers...\"\n*   The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"**Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple stack-based buffer overflows exist in the API controllers of FortiWeb. **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflows [CWE-121].\"\n\nCWE-119 and CWE-787 were considered because they are parent classes of CWE-121. However, CWE-121 is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\nCWE-120 was considered because it is a type of buffer overflow, but it is not specific to stack-based overflows.\nCWE-190 was considered because integer overflows can sometimes lead to buffer overflows, but there is no direct evidence of an integer overflow in this case.\nCWE-113 was considered, but is specific to HTTP Request/Response splitting.\n\nTherefore, CWE-121 is the optimal choice because it directly reflects the **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerability described in the provided information.",
