CWE-1390 is a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), which is also a Class-level CWE. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-1390 is a more specific classification of the **weak authentication** issue described in the vulnerability. I considered CWE-287 because it is a parent of CWE-1390, but ultimately chose CWE-1390 for its greater specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe1390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1390 primary\n    class cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with **improper handling of the login** process. This leads to **weak authentication**, which allows an unauthenticated attacker to access the application without a valid account.\n\nRoot Cause: **improper handling of the login**\nWeakness: **Weak Authentication (CWE-1390)**\nImpact: Access to the application without a valid account\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, supported by the retriever results, pointed towards CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) as a strong candidate. The vulnerability description clearly states that the \"mobile server component... **improperly handles the log in** for Active Directory accounts... This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to access the application without a valid account.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" further confirms this by stating: \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Weak authentication (CWE-1390). An authentication bypass vulnerability exists that allows unauthorized access.\"\n\nCWE-287 (Improper Authentication) was considered as a parent class of CWE-1390. However, the description specifically points to a **weak authentication** mechanism rather than a complete absence of authentication, making CWE-1390 a more precise fit.\n\nThe final decision to select CWE-1390 is based on the direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the retriever results, which align with the CWE's characteristics. The selection is further reinforced by the CWE's mapping guidance, which allows for its use with review, acknowledging that more specific entries may exist. In this case, no even more specific CWE was identified in the provided data.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
