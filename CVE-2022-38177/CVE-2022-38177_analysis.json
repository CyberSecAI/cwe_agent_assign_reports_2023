It is a child of CWE-772 [Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime] and CWE-404 [Improper Resource Shutdown or Release].\n\nCWE-347 [Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature] is a base-level CWE which is considered as a secondary issue. It is a child of CWE-345 [Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity].\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe772[\"CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n\n    cwe401 -->|CHILDOF| cwe772\n    cwe401 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe401 primary\n    class cwe347 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the attacker spoofing the resolver with responses containing a **malformed ECDSA signature**. This leads to the **improper handling or lack of verification of the signature** and subsequently results in a **memory leak**, eventually causing a denial of service due to resource exhaustion.\n\n1.  Attacker sends spoofed response with **malformed ECDSA signature**.\n2.  Improper or missing verification of the cryptographic signature (CWE-347).\n3.  Memory is allocated but not released (CWE-401).\n4.  Gradual memory erosion leads to denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, supported by the \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" and \"Retriever Results,\" points to CWE-401 [Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime] as the primary weakness. The \"Vulnerability Description\" clearly states that the **malformed ECDSA signature** triggers a **memory leak**, which aligns directly with the description of CWE-401: \"The product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this: \"Memory leak in the ECDSA DNSSEC verification code.\"\n\nCWE-347 [Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature] is considered as a secondary CWE. It is the **malformed ECDSA signature** that leads to the memory leak.\n\nThe selection of CWE-401 [Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime] as the primary CWE and CWE-347 [Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature] as secondary is based on the evidence provided and their respective descriptions. Both CWEs are at appropriate levels of specificity (Variant and Base, respectively).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is a high-level CWE and not specific to the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This CWE is not relevant as the memory is not being reused.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* CWE-401 [Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime] is a child of this CWE and is a better fit for the description.\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* Too generic and doesn't directly relate to memory management.\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* Not relevant;
