CWE-212 is a related weakness as the root cause is the failure to remove the sensitive data before it is sent. CWE-201 is a base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n\n    cwe201 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe212\n    cwe226[\"CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\"]\n    cwe201 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe226\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe212 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to remove protected fields** in the LiveQuery component of Parse Server. This leads to the **insertion of sensitive information into the data sent to the client**, resulting in potential exposure of those fields to unauthorized users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified that the **rootcause** was \"**Parse Server LiveQuery does not remove protected fields in classes**\" and the **vector** was \"passing them to the client.\"\n\nThe vulnerability involves Parse Server LiveQuery failing to remove protected fields, leading to the transmission of this data to the client. This aligns directly with CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data), where sensitive data is included in the transmitted data.\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating that \"Parse Server LiveQuery did not properly remove protected fields in classes before passing data to the client,\" leading to \"Exposure of protected fields to unauthorized clients via LiveQuery.\"\n\nThe best match based on the retriever results is CWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer).\nCWE-201 and CWE-212 have a close relationship, with CWE-201 often following CWE-212.\nThe CWE specifications describe CWE-212 as concerning sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, while CWE-201 describes the sensitive information being sent.\nThe evidence points to the information being sent which makes CWE-201 the primary CWE.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity (Base level) and accurately reflect the nature of the vulnerability, supported by both the vulnerability description and the CVE reference.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
