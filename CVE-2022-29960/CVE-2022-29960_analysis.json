CWE-321 is more specific and accurately reflects the **root cause**, as it directly involves a cryptographic key. CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) is a class-level CWE, while CWE-1240 (Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation) is a base-level CWE related to risky cryptographic implementations and is also considered. Selecting CWE-321 offers a more precise characterization than its parent or related peer Class CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe1240[\"CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\"]\n    \n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe1240 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe321 primary\n    class cwe798,cwe327,cwe1240 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause**: the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys (CWE-321). The impact is potential unauthorized filesystem access and privilege escalation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description clearly states the use of **weak cryptography**, specifically DES with hardcoded cryptographic keys. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the **root cause** as the \"use of hard-coded cryptographic keys.\"\n\nCWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) is selected as the primary CWE because it precisely matches the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" also point towards \"weak cryptography\" as the root cause.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-321, CWE-327 and CWE-1240.\n\nCWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) and CWE-1240 (Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation) are considered as secondary candidates because the use of DES, while not explicitly stated as \"broken\" in the description, is considered weak by modern standards. However, CWE-321 is a more direct match to the described **root cause**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-321 is at the optimal level of specificity (Variant) because it directly addresses the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses default credentials (such as passwords or cryptographic keys) for potentially critical functionality.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1394: Use of Default Cryptographic Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a default cryptographic key for potentially critical functionality.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
