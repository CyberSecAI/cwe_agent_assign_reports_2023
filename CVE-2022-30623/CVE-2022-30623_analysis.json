CWE-565 and CWE-784 are both related to the use of cookies without proper validation. CWE-784 is a Variant of CWE-565 and is more specific to security decisions. CWE-288 is related to CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) via a ChildOf relationship.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n    cwe565[\"CWE-565: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking\"]\n    cwe784[\"CWE-784: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe784 -->|CHILDOF| cwe565\n    cwe288 -->|CHILDOF| cwe306\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe288 primary\n    class cwe565,cwe784 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** that allows the user to **bypass the identification with the username and password** by entering a value in the cookie. This leads to the **bypass of authentication**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-288 as the primary candidate due to the **bypass of authentication** via a cookie. The retriever results and vulnerability description key phrases support this. The vulnerability description states \"The server checks the users cookie in a non-standard way, and a value is entered in the cookie value name of the status and its value is set to true to **bypass the identification with the system using a username and password**.\"\n\nCWE-288 is the most appropriate because the authentication process, which normally requires a username and password, can be bypassed by manipulating the cookie. This is an alternate path that does not require authentication.\n\nCWE-565 and CWE-784 were considered as secondary CWEs because the vulnerability involves reliance on cookies without validation. CWE-784 is a variant of CWE-565 and is more specific to security decisions that rely on cookies without proper validation.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-288 directly addresses the authentication bypass, while CWE-565 and CWE-784 highlight the underlying issue of improper cookie handling.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-784: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of a cookie, but it does not properly ensure that the cookie is valid for the associated user.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-565: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product relies on the existence or values of cookies when performing security-critical operations, but it does not properly ensure that the setting is valid for the associated user.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTwo separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
