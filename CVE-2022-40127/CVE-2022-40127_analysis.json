Also, CWE-78 can be followed by CWE-184, Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs. This highlights the chain of events where **improper neutralization** can lead to OS Command Injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe184[\"CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\"]\n\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe78 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe184\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe184 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper handling of the `run_id` parameter**, which allows an attacker to inject commands. This leads directly to OS Command Injection and the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The key evidence is the statement that the vulnerability allows an attacker to \"execute arbitrary commands via manually provided run_id parameter.\" This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-78, Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection').\n\nThe selection of CWE-78 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the **root cause** of the vulnerability: the ability to inject OS commands due to **improper neutralization** of special elements in the `run_id` parameter.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\nNot Selected: This CWE is not applicable since the vulnerability does not involve validating equivalence of input.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\nNot Selected: This is a Class-level CWE.
