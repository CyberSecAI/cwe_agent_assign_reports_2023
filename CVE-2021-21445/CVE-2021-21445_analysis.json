CWE-113 is related to CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) via a CanPrecede relationship, indicating that request/response splitting can lead to XSS. The weakness is a failure to neutralize CRLF sequences in HTTP headers, leading to potential HTTP Request/Response Splitting, which can further lead to XSS. CWE-20 is a Class-level CWE that is too general, but it reflects the **improper input validation** aspect of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output\"]\n    cwe436[\"CWE-436: Interpretation Conflict\"]\n\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe93\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe436\n    cwe113 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe113 primary\n    class cwe20,cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20), which leads to the inclusion of invalidated data in the HTTP response Content Type header (CWE-113), potentially leading to cross-site scripting (CWE-79) and page hijacking.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment considered CWE-20 due to the stated **improper input validation**. However, CWE-20 is a very broad class. The description mentions the inclusion of invalidated data in the HTTP response Content Type header, which strongly suggests CWE-113 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')). The potential for cross-site scripting (XSS) and page hijacking suggests that the CRLF injection could be used to manipulate the HTTP response.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description includes the phrase \"**improper input validation**\" as the root cause and \"cross-site scripting and page hijacking\" as the impact. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms the **improper input validation** leading to these attacks.\n\nThe selection of CWE-113 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the vulnerability mechanism of CRLF injection in HTTP headers. It accurately captures the **root cause** and the potential for HTTP response splitting, which can lead to further attacks.\nCWE-20 is included as a secondary CWE because it is the general class of the **root cause** (improper input validation), but it is not as specific as CWE-113.\nCWE-79 is included as a secondary CWE because the description mentions that the impact is XSS.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*This CWE was considered, but it is too high-level. CWE-113 is a more specific variant.*\n\n## CWE-838: Inappropriate Encoding for Output Context\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses or specifies an encoding when generating output to a downstream component, but the specified encoding is not the same as the encoding that is expected by the downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because the vulnerability is more about improper neutralization than encoding.*\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because it only covers XSS involving HTML tags. The CRLF injection could lead to other attacks as well.*\n\n## CWE-707: Improper Neutralization\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not ensure or incorrectly ensures that structured messages or data are well-formed and that certain security properties are met before being read from an upstream component or sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because it is too high-level.*\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because the vulnerability is not specifically about unsafe equivalence.*\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because the vulnerability is not specifically about an incomplete list of disallowed inputs.*\n\n## CWE-436: Interpretation Conflict\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nProduct A handles inputs or steps differently than Product B, which causes A to perform incorrect actions based on its perception of B's state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This CWE was not selected, even though it is a parent of CWE-113, because it is too abstract and doesn't capture the specific issue.*\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compart",
