This has a child relationship to CWE-119 **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**, which is a class level CWE. CWE-120 **Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')** is a peer of CWE-787, and both are children of CWE-119. CWE-120 can precede CWE-787. The relationships show how buffer overflows can result in out-of-bounds writes.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe131[\"CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    cwe125 -->|PEEROF| cwe787\n    cwe131 -->|RELATED| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe125,cwe131 secondary\n    class cwe119,cwe120 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing bounds check**, which leads to an **out of bounds write**, and results in remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-787 **Out-of-bounds Write**.\nThe vulnerability description clearly states: \"there is a possible **out of bounds write** due to a **missing bounds check**\". This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-787, which involves writing data beyond the intended boundaries of a memory buffer. The **missing bounds check** is a clear indicator of the root cause. The impact, remote code execution, is a typical consequence of such a write.\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description key phrases is:\n- **rootcause:** **missing bounds check**\n- **weakness:** **out of bounds write**\nThe retriever results did not have CWE-787 in the top results, but instead focused on concurrency and locking issues, which are not directly supported by the provided description.\nCWE-787 is at the base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\nI also considered CWE-125 **Out-of-bounds Read**, since a **missing bounds check** could also lead to reading beyond the intended boundaries of a memory buffer. This is a definite possibility, so I rated it as a secondary candidate with a confidence of 0.8.\n\nI also considered CWE-131 **Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size**, since the **missing bounds check** could also be a result of calculating the wrong buffer size. This is a plausible, but less direct cause, so I rated it as a secondary candidate with a confidence of 0.6.\n\nI rejected CWE-20 **Improper Input Validation** because the vulnerability is more specific than general input validation. Also, CWE-20 is discouraged.\n\nI rejected CWE-667 **Improper Locking**, CWE-362 **Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')**, CWE-413 **Improper Resource Locking** because there is no evidence of concurrency or locking issues in the description.",
