CWE-329 (**Generation of Predictable IV with CBC Mode**) is a Variant of CWE-1204, and represents a more specific case where the weak IV is used with CBC mode. The vulnerability description mentions the use of **non-random IVs**, which directly relates to CWE-1204. Since the description also mentions CBC mode, CWE-329 could also be considered.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1204[\"CWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)\"]\n    cwe329[\"CWE-329: Generation of Predictable IV with CBC Mode\"]\n    cwe330[\"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\"]\n\n    cwe329 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1204\n    cwe1204 -->|CHILDOF| cwe330\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1204 primary\n    class cwe329 secondary\n    class cwe330 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Non-random IVs** are used in the application layer encryption. (CWE-1204)\n2.  **Weakness:** The use of predictable IVs in CBC mode makes the encryption susceptible to attacks. (CWE-329, if applicable)\n3.  **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attackers can tamper with messages.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the use of **non-random IVs**, which directly maps to CWE-1204. The vulnerability description key phrases also highlights \"**non-random IVs**\" as the rootcause. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause is the use of non-random Initialization Vectors (IVs) with Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode.\nThe description supports CWE-1204 as the Base CWE.\nCWE-329 is a potential secondary CWE since it is a Variant of CWE-1204.\n\nI am selecting CWE-1204 as the primary CWE because the root cause is the use of **non-random IVs**.\nI considered CWE-329 because it mentions CBC mode, but the core issue is the **non-random IVs**, making CWE-1204 the more appropriate primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
