These relationships indicate that the vulnerability involves accessing memory that has already been freed. While other CWEs like CWE-366 (Race Condition within a Thread) and CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')) are related to concurrency issues, the description doesn't explicitly mention concurrency. The **heap corruption** mentioned in the description aligns with potential impacts of CWE-416.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource after Expiration\"]\n    cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\"]\n    \n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe664 -->|ParentOf| cwe672\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe825,cwe672 secondary\n    class cwe664 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **use after free** condition (CWE-416), which leads to **heap corruption**. The specific user gestures act as the trigger or exploit vector.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates a **use after free** condition in the Screen Capture component of Google Chrome on Chrome OS. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this with the statement, \"Use after free in Screen Capture.\" This aligns directly with CWE-416 (Use After Free), which is a Variant-level CWE and preferred for mapping. The description also mentions **heap corruption**, which is a common consequence of use-after-free vulnerabilities. The retriever results also list CWE-416 as the top match.\n\nCWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime) was considered because it is a parent of CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiration), which is a parent of CWE-416. However, CWE-664 is too general (Pillar level) and doesn't directly represent the specific vulnerability.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence and the preferred level of abstraction, CWE-416 is the most appropriate mapping.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
