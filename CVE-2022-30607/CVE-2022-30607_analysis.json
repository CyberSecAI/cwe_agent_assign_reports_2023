There is also the child relationship of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) to CWE-668, but the relationship between CWE-522 and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is also present, suggesting authentication issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe522,cwe668,cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **information not properly masked** in the control center UI, leading to the impact of sensitive information exposure.\n  - Root Cause: **Information not properly masked** in the control center UI.\n  - Weakness: Exposure of sensitive information due to **improper masking**.\n  - Impact: An attacker could obtain sensitive information, specifically user IDs across different tenants.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis focuses on identifying the root cause and impact of the vulnerability based on the provided description and CVE reference. The primary CWE is CWE-200, as the main issue is the exposure of sensitive information due to **improper masking**. However, the MITRE guidance discourages using CWE-200, but the description matches the weakness. The weakness might also involve credentials, leading to the inclusion of CWE-522 as a secondary candidate.\n\nThe selection of CWE-200 is based on the vulnerability description stating that a user can obtain sensitive information due to **information not properly masked** in the control center UI. This aligns with CWE-200's description of exposing sensitive information to unauthorized actors. While MITRE discourages the use of CWE-200, the specifics of this vulnerability directly involve the mishandling of sensitive information, making it a relevant choice.\n\nCWE-522 is included as a secondary CWE because the exposed information could potentially include credentials, as the description mentions sensitive information being obtained. However, without explicit mention of credentials, it remains a secondary consideration.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, given the information provided. CWE-200 is a class-level CWE, but it directly addresses the **information exposure** aspect. More specific CWEs could be considered if more details about the exact type of information and the mechanism of exposure were available.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Rationale for Exclusion:* This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is not related to reliance on untrusted inputs in a security decision.\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
