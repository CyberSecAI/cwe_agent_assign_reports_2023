# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-33900

## Vulnerability Description
PHP Object Injection vulnerability in Easy Digital Downloads plugin <= 3.0.1 at WordPress.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **PHP object injection**
- **product:** Easy Digital Downloads plugin
- **version:** <= 3.0.1
- **component:** WordPress

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-33900:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a result of insecure handling of PHP objects within the Easy Digital Downloads plugin. Specifically, it involves a **PHP Object Injection** flaw.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **PHP Object Injection:** The core weakness is the ability to manipulate and inject PHP objects into the application. This occurs due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied data.
   - This type of vulnerability allows for the attacker to control the structure and content of PHP objects that are instantiated by the vulnerable code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could have severe consequences:
  - **Code Injection:** Attackers can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leading to complete compromise of the website.
  - **SQL Injection:** The injected objects could manipulate database queries, leading to unauthorized data access or modification.
   - **Path Traversal:** Attackers might gain access to sensitive files outside the webroot.
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** Malicious object instantiation could crash the system and disrupt the service.
  - **Arbitrary Actions**: In general, an attacker can perform any action the web application is capable of if they can construct a working "POP chain", which takes advantage of various parts of an application's codebase.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the manipulation of user-supplied input that is later deserialized by PHP within the vulnerable plugin. The details of how the plugin accepts and processes this input would be needed to create an attack.
- The `patchstack.com` content suggests this could occur via a crafted object that's passed in a request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to provide crafted input, likely through a web request.
- According to patchstack, a "Shop Manager" level of privilege would be required, but it's possible that this is not a pre-requisite if the vulnerable code can be reached unauthenticated.

**Additional Notes:**
- The `patchstack.com` content also specifies this is a "Low" priority vulnerability. However, the potential impact of PHP object injection can be very high, so this should not be taken to mean it is not dangerous.
- The fix for the vulnerability is to upgrade to version 3.0.2 or later.

**Summary:**
CVE-2022-33900 in the Easy Digital Downloads plugin stems from a PHP Object Injection vulnerability. This vulnerability allows a malicious attacker, with some level of access to the site, to inject arbitrary PHP objects, potentially leading to code execution, SQL injection, path traversal, or denial of service. The vulnerability was addressed in version 3.0.2 of the plugin.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Marshaling, Unmarshaling: Marshaling and unmarshaling are effectively synonyms for serialization and deserialization, respectively.
Pickling, Unpickling: In Python, the "pickle" functionality is used to perform serialization and deserialization.
PHP Object Injection: Some PHP application researchers use this term when attacking unsafe use of the unserialize() function; but it is also used for CWE-915.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-913
ChildOf -> CWE-913
PeerOf -> CWE-915

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between CWE-502 and CWE-915 need further exploration. CWE-915 is more narrowly scoped to object modification, and is not necessarily used for deserialization.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-12799:** chain: bypass of untrusted deserialization issue (CWE-502) by using an assumed-trusted class (CWE-183)
- **CVE-2015-8103:** Deserialization issue in commonly-used Java library allows remote execution.
- **CVE-2015-4852:** Deserialization issue in commonly-used Java library allows remote execution.




## CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component that specifies multiple attributes, properties, or fields that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control which attributes can be modified.

### Extended Description


If the object contains attributes that were only intended for internal use, then their unexpected modification could lead to a vulnerability.


This weakness is sometimes known by the language-specific mechanisms that make it possible, such as mass assignment, autobinding, or object injection.


### Alternative Terms
Mass Assignment: "Mass assignment" is the name of a feature in Ruby on Rails that allows simultaneous modification of multiple object attributes.
AutoBinding: The "Autobinding" term is used in frameworks such as Spring MVC and ASP.NET MVC.
PHP Object Injection: Some PHP application researchers use this term for attacking unsafe use of the unserialize() function, but it is also used for CWE-502.

### Relationships

PeerOf -> CWE-502

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between CWE-502 and CWE-915 need further exploration. CWE-915 is more narrowly scoped to object modification, and is not necessarily used for deserialization.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-3283:** Application for using LLMs allows modification of a sensitive variable using mass assignment.
- **CVE-2012-2054:** Mass assignment allows modification of arbitrary attributes using modified URL.
- **CVE-2012-2055:** Source version control product allows modification of trusted key using mass assignment.




## CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-94

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** "HTML injection" (see CWE-79: XSS) could be thought of as an example of this, but the code is injected and executed on the client side, not the server side. Server-Side Includes (SSI) are an example of direct static code injection.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-0495:** Perl code directly injected into CGI library file from parameters to another CGI program.
- **CVE-2005-1876:** Direct PHP code injection into supporting template file.
- **CVE-2005-1894:** Direct code injection into PHP script that can be accessed by attacker.




## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Unrestricted File Upload: Used in vulnerability databases and elsewhere, but it is insufficiently precise. The phrase could be interpreted as the lack of restrictions on the size or number of uploaded files, which is a resource consumption issue.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-669
ChildOf -> CWE-669
PeerOf -> CWE-351
PeerOf -> CWE-436
PeerOf -> CWE-430

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

This can have a chaining relationship with incomplete denylist / permissive allowlist errors when the product tries, but fails, to properly limit which types of files are allowed (CWE-183, CWE-184).


This can also overlap multiple interpretation errors for intermediaries, e.g. anti-virus products that do not remove or quarantine attachments with certain file extensions that can be processed by client systems.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-5227:** PHP-based FAQ management app does not check the MIME type for uploaded images
- **CVE-2001-0901:** Web-based mail product stores ".shtml" attachments that could contain SSI
- **CVE-2002-1841:** PHP upload does not restrict file types




## CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g. "eval").

### Extended Description
This may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, or at least modify what code can be executed.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-94

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Factors: special character errors can play a role in increasing the variety of code that can be injected, although some vulnerabilities do not require special characters at all, e.g. when a single function without arguments can be referenced and a terminator character is not necessary.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-4181:** Framework for LLM applications allows eval injection via a crafted response from a hosting provider.
- **CVE-2022-2054:** Python compiler uses eval() to execute malicious strings as Python code.
- **CVE-2021-22204:** Chain: regex in EXIF processor code does not correctly determine where a string ends (CWE-625), enabling eval injection (CWE-95), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction:** Compound
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

### Extended Description
When a web server is designed to receive a request from a client without any mechanism for verifying that it was intentionally sent, then it might be possible for an attacker to trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server which will be treated as an authentic request. This can be done via a URL, image load, XMLHttpRequest, etc. and can result in exposure of data or unintended code execution.

### Alternative Terms
Session Riding
Cross Site Reference Forgery
XSRF

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-345
ChildOf -> CWE-345
Requires -> CWE-346
Requires -> CWE-441
Requires -> CWE-642
Requires -> CWE-613

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.
**Comments:** While attack-oriented composites are supported in CWE, they have not been a focus of research. There is a chance that future research or CWE scope clarifications will change or deprecate them. Perform root-cause analysis to determine if other weaknesses allow CSRF attacks to occur, and map to those weaknesses. For example, predictable CSRF tokens might allow bypass of CSRF protection mechanisms; if this occurs, they might be better characterized as randomness/predictability weaknesses.
**Reasons:**
- Other


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

There can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.


**[Theoretical]** 

The CSRF topology is multi-channel:


  - Attacker (as outsider) to intermediary (as user). The interaction point is either an external or internal channel.

  - Intermediary (as user) to server (as victim). The activation point is an internal channel.





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2004-1703:** Add user accounts via a URL in an img tag
- **CVE-2004-1995:** Add user accounts via a URL in an img tag
- **CVE-2004-1967:** Arbitrary code execution by specifying the code in a crafted img tag or URL




## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

### Extended Description


This could allow an attacker to access or modify system files or other files that are critical to the application.


Path manipulation errors occur when the following two conditions are met:

```
		1. An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.
		2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.
```
For example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-642
ChildOf -> CWE-610
ChildOf -> CWE-20
CanPrecede -> CWE-22
CanPrecede -> CWE-41
CanPrecede -> CWE-98
CanPrecede -> CWE-434
CanPrecede -> CWE-59

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** CWE-114 is a Class, but it is listed a child of CWE-73 in view 1000. This suggests some abstraction problems that should be resolved in future versions.

**[Relationship]** 

The external control of filenames can be the primary link in chains with other file-related weaknesses, as seen in the CanPrecede relationships. This is because software systems use files for many different purposes: to execute programs, load code libraries, to store application data, to store configuration settings, record temporary data, act as signals or semaphores to other processes, etc.


However, those weaknesses do not always require external control. For example, link-following weaknesses (CWE-59) often involve pathnames that are not controllable by the attacker at all.


The external control can be resultant from other issues. For example, in PHP applications, the register_globals setting can allow an attacker to modify variables that the programmer thought were immutable, enabling file inclusion (CWE-98) and path traversal (CWE-22). Operating with excessive privileges (CWE-250) might allow an attacker to specify an input filename that is not directly readable by the attacker, but is accessible to the privileged program. A buffer overflow (CWE-119) might give an attacker control over nearby memory locations that are related to pathnames, but were not directly modifiable by the attacker.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)
- **CVE-2008-5748:** Chain: external control of values for user's desired language and theme enables path traversal.
- **CVE-2008-5764:** Chain: external control of user's target language enables remote file inclusion.




## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
SQL injection: a common attack-oriented phrase
SQLi: a common abbreviation for "SQL injection"

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-943
ChildOf -> CWE-74

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** SQL injection can be resultant from special character mismanagement, MAID, or denylist/allowlist problems. It can be primary to authentication errors.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-32530:** SQL injection in security product dashboard using crafted certificate fields
- **CVE-2021-42258:** SQL injection in time and billing software, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-27101:** SQL injection in file-transfer system via a crafted Host header, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

### Extended Description
Most languages and protocols have their own special elements such as characters and reserved words. These special elements can carry control implications. If product does not prevent external control or influence over the inclusion of such special elements, the control flow of the program may be altered from what was intended. For example, both Unix and Windows interpret the symbol < ("less than") as meaning "read input from a file".

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-707

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness can be related to interpretation conflicts or interaction errors in intermediaries (such as proxies or application firewalls) when the intermediary's model of an endpoint does not account for protocol-specific special elements.

**[Relationship]** See this entry's children for different types of special elements that have been observed at one point or another. However, it can be difficult to find suitable CVE examples. In an attempt to be complete, CWE includes some types that do not have any associated observed example.

**[Research Gap]** This weakness is probably under-studied for proprietary or custom formats. It is likely that these issues are fairly common in applications that use their own custom format for configuration files, logs, meta-data, messaging, etc. They would only be found by accident or with a focused effort based on an understanding of the format.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-0677:** Read arbitrary files from mail client by providing a special MIME header that is internally used to store pathnames for attachments.
- **CVE-2000-0703:** Setuid program does not cleanse special escape sequence before sending data to a mail program, causing the mail program to process those sequences.
- **CVE-2003-0020:** Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.




## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

### Extended Description


Improper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.


Most products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" is a structured message containing a command ("GET") with a single argument ("/index.html") and metadata about which protocol version is being used ("HTTP/1.1").


If an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.


### Alternative Terms

Output Validation
Output Encoding

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-707
CanPrecede -> CWE-74

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness is primary to all weaknesses related to injection (CWE-74) since the inherent nature of injection involves the violation of structured messages.

**[Relationship]** 

CWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.


However, input validation is not always sufficient, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a last name is inserted into a query. The name "O'Reilly" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the "'" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise neutralized. In this case, stripping the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.


**[Terminology]** The usage of the "encoding" and "escaping" terms varies widely. For example, in some programming languages, the terms are used interchangeably, while other languages provide APIs that use both terms for different tasks. This overlapping usage extends to the Web, such as the "escape" JavaScript function whose purpose is stated to be encoding. The concepts of encoding and escaping predate the Web by decades. Given such a context, it is difficult for CWE to adopt a consistent vocabulary that will not be misinterpreted by some constituency.

**[Theoretical]** This is a data/directive boundary error in which data boundaries are not sufficiently enforced before it is sent to a different control sphere.

**[Research Gap]** While many published vulnerabilities are related to insufficient output encoding, there is such an emphasis on input validation as a protection mechanism that the underlying causes are rarely described. Within CVE, the focus is primarily on well-understood issues like cross-site scripting and SQL injection. It is likely that this weakness frequently occurs in custom protocols that support multiple encodings, which are not necessarily detectable with automated techniques.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-41232:** Chain: authentication routine in Go-based agile development product does not escape user name (CWE-116), allowing LDAP injection (CWE-90)
- **CVE-2008-4636:** OS command injection in backup software using shell metacharacters in a filename; correct behavior would require that this filename could not be changed.
- **CVE-2008-0769:** Web application does not set the charset when sending a page to a browser, allowing for XSS exploitation when a browser chooses an unexpected encoding.
