CWE-787 is also related to CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) through the ChildOf relationship: CWE-787 is a more specific type of CWE-119.\nCWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is a variant of CWE-787, making it more specific. However, without direct evidence of heap allocation, CWE-787 is preferred.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe122,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a crafted HTML page leading to a **heap buffer overflow** in ANGLE which results in potential heap corruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified a **heap buffer overflow** as the root cause, as stated in the vulnerability description and CVE details: \"Heap **buffer overflow** in ANGLE.\" The primary CWE match based on similar CVE descriptions is CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write).\n\nCWE-787 accurately represents the vulnerability because it describes writing data past the end of the intended buffer. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms the \"**heap buffer overflow**\" as the **weakness**.\n\nCWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) was considered since the overflow occurs in the heap. However, without more explicit evidence confirming the heap allocation mechanism, the broader CWE-787 is chosen.\n\nCWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) was also considered, given its relation to buffer overflows. However, CWE-787 is a more specific and appropriate choice. The MITRE Mapping Guidance discourages the use of CWE-119 when more specific CWEs are available.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-787 is at the optimal level of specificity, accurately capturing the **out-of-bounds write** condition as the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n### Technical Explanation:\nThe vulnerability involves writing data beyond the allocated buffer's boundaries. This can overwrite adjacent memory regions, leading to unpredictable behavior and potentially arbitrary code execution.\n### Security Implications:\nOut-of-bounds writes can corrupt data structures, overwrite function pointers, or inject malicious code, leading to a complete system compromise.\n### Relationship:\nCWE-787 is a base CWE and a parent of CWE-124 (Buffer Underwrite). It is also a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).\n### Mapping Guidance:\nThe official MITRE mapping guidance allows for the use of CWE-787.\n## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\n### Technical Explanation:\nThis is a specific type of buffer overflow where the vulnerable buffer is allocated on the heap. Overwriting data on the heap can lead to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution.\n### Security Implications:\nSimilar to stack-based buffer overflows, heap-based overflows can lead to arbitrary code execution and complete system compromise.\n### Relationship:\nCWE-122 is a variant of CWE-787.\n### Mapping Guidance:\nThe official MITRE mapping guidance allows for the use of CWE-122.\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n### Technical Explanation:\nThis is a general class of vulnerabilities that involve reading or writing outside the intended boundaries of a memory buffer.\n### Security Implications:\nOut-of-bounds access can lead to information disclosure, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution.\n### Relationship:\nCWE-119 is a class CWE and a parent of CWE-787 and CWE-125.\n### Mapping Guidance:\nThe official MITRE mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-119 when more specific CWEs are available.",
