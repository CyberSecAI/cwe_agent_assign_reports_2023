While CWE-674 is a Class, the evidence strongly supports its selection as the primary weakness given the recursive nature described in the vulnerability.\n\nSecondary CWEs, CWE-770 and CWE-789, are related to resource allocation issues that arise from the deserialization process. These CWEs can precede the stack overflow.\n\nCWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data) reflects the unsafe deserialization process that allows manipulation of the input stream and injection of malicious objects.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe674[\"CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    cwe834[\"CWE-834: Excessive Iteration\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe674 -->|CHILDOF| cwe834\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    cwe502 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe674 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe789,cwe502 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **deserialization of untrusted data** (CWE-502), which allows an attacker to manipulate the input stream and inject objects. This leads to **uncontrolled resource allocation** (CWE-770) and **excessive memory allocation** (CWE-789) as the system processes the malicious input. The recursive nature of the injected objects then triggers **uncontrolled recursion** (CWE-674), ultimately causing a **stack overflow** and denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-674 as the primary weakness due to the **uncontrolled recursion** leading to a stack overflow. This is supported by the vulnerability description, which states that the attack uses the hash code implementation for collections and maps to force recursive hash calculation, causing a stack overflow. The **rootcause** is the **stack overflow in XML serialization**.\n\nThe Retriever Results and Complete CWE Specifications were reviewed to confirm this assessment and identify potential secondary weaknesses. CWE-770, CWE-789, and CWE-502 were identified as relevant secondary weaknesses, as they contribute to the vulnerability chain.\n\nThe final selection of CWEs is based on the provided evidence and the relationships between CWEs. CWE-674 is the most specific and accurate representation of the primary weakness, while CWE-770, CWE-789, and CWE-502 capture related aspects of the vulnerability chain. These CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
