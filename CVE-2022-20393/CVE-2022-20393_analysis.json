CWE-190 is a base-level CWE, providing a good level of specificity. CWE-125 is also a base-level CWE. CWE-190 can precede CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), which can then lead to CWE-125.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe125 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow (CWE-190)**, which leads to an **out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)**. The **integer overflow** is the root cause, and the **out-of-bounds read** is the direct consequence.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **integer overflow (CWE-190)** as the primary root cause leading to the **out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)**.
