While the description indicates that sensitive URLs are accessible to unauthenticated users, this is a general category. CWE-598 is a variant of CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) and is a child of CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor). CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE. The relationship between CWE-284 and its potential child CWEs like CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was considered, but the provided evidence doesn't specify whether authorization is entirely missing or incorrectly implemented.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe598[\"CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe598 -->|CHILDOF| cwe201\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe598,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **improper access control** (CWE-284), leading to the exposure of sensitive web URLs. Since the access is via GET request, sensitive information can get exposed via query strings (CWE-598).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is **improper access control**. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions that \"Unauthenticated users can access sensitive web URLs,\" which points to a problem in access control mechanisms.\n\nThe retriever results suggested several CWEs, including CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')), CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function), and CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')). However, these CWEs are not the most appropriate based on the provided evidence. CWE-425 describes a situation where authorization is not adequately enforced on all restricted URLs, which is similar but not exactly the same as **improper access control**. CWE-306 refers to a complete lack of authentication, which is not explicitly stated in the description. CWE-22 involves path traversal, which is not related to the described vulnerability.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was also considered, but it is a high-level CWE and the description notes that it's often misused. The access via GET request leads to CWE-598 (Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings).\n\nThe selected CWEs (CWE-284, CWE-598, and CWE-200) are at an appropriate level of specificity given the available information. Further investigation could reveal whether the **improper access control** is due to missing or incorrect authorization, which would allow for a more specific CWE to be assigned (e.g., CWE-862 or CWE-863). The evidence from the vulnerability description is \"Unauthenticated users can access sensitive web URLs through GET request, which should be restricted to maintenance users only\" and \"**rootcause:** **improper access control**\".\n\nRelevant CWE Information:",
