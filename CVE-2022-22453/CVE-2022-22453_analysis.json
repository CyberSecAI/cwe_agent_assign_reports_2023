CWE-327 and CWE-1240 were considered as possible related CWEs. CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) is a peer of CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data), while CWE-1240 (Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation) is a child of CWE-327. These relationships show a potential chain where a risky algorithm (CWE-327) might stem from a risky implementation (CWE-1240). The abstraction levels influenced the decision to choose CWE-326 as primary, given the limited information, but to include CWE-327 and CWE-1240 as secondary considerations.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe326[\"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe1240[\"CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\"]\n\n    cwe1240 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    cwe326 -->|PEEROF| cwe327\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe326 primary\n    class cwe327,cwe1240 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms** (CWE-326), which can potentially lead to the decryption of highly sensitive information. This chain highlights the initial weakness and its direct impact.\n  - Root Cause: CWE-326 (**weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms**)\n  - Impact: Decrypt highly sensitive information\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the vulnerability description mentioning **weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms**. The retriever results pointed towards CWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength), CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm), and CWE-1240 (Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation).\n\nThe final decision to select CWE-326 as the primary CWE is based on the evidence: \"IBM Security Verify Identity Manager 10.0 uses **weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms** that could allow an attacker to decrypt highly sensitive information.\" This statement directly aligns with the description of CWE-326, which is about using encryption that is \"not strong enough for the level of protection required.\"\n\nCWE-327 and CWE-1240 are included as secondary considerations due to the possibility that the **inadequate encryption strength** stems from either a broken/risky algorithm or a risky implementation of a cryptographic primitive, respectively. However, without more specific details, CWE-326 is the most appropriate primary mapping.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the described weakness without making assumptions about the underlying cause. CWE-326 captures the essence of the problem, while CWE-327 and CWE-1240 represent potential underlying causes that cannot be confirmed with the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
