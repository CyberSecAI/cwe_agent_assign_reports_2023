## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 0.75 | Pillar | Discouraged | This is the Primary CWE |
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.65 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-285 | Improper Authorization | 0.65 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), which is a high-level Pillar. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) are children of CWE-284, representing more specific types of access control issues. The hierarchical relationship indicates that while CWE-284 broadly captures the nature of the vulnerability, CWE-863 and CWE-285 offer more detailed classifications.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain starts with an **improper access control**, leading to the ability for unauthorized attackers to execute arbitrary activity without proper permissions. The root cause is the **improper access control** in the dynamic receiver of ApkInstaller.

## Summary of Analysis
Initially, the vulnerability was identified as stemming from **improper access control**, which allows unauthorized attackers to execute arbitrary activities. The primary assessment considered the high-level nature of this description, aligning it with CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). However, the retriever results suggested more specific CWEs related to authorization, such as CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization).

The evidence from the provided text is:
*   "**Improper access control** vulnerability in dynamic receiver in ApkInstaller prior to SMR MAR-2022 Release allows unauthorized attackers to execute arbitrary activity without a proper permission"
*   "**Root Cause:** The root cause is an "Improper access control vulnerability" in the dynamic receiver of the ApkInstaller application."
*   "**Weaknesses:** The weakness is the lack of proper permission checks when executing an activity in ApkInstaller. This allows unauthorized applications to bypass intended access control."
*   "**Impact:** The impact is that "unauthorized attackers [can] execute arbitrary activity without a proper permission""

The graph relationships influenced the decision to consider CWE-863 and CWE-285 as secondary options, as they are children of CWE-284 and offer more specific classifications related to authorization. While a specific authorization implementation flaw isn't described to confidently select a more specific Base CWE, the Class-level authorization options are good secondary considerations.

The selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, given the available evidence. CWE-284 is a broad classification that captures the overall nature of the vulnerability, while the authorization-related CWEs provide additional context without requiring detailed knowledge of the specific implementation flaws.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges 
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.

## CWE-424: Improper Protection of Alternate Path
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently protect all possible paths that a user can take to access restricted functionality or resources.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 6280.38
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor
