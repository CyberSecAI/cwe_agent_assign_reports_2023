CWE-126 is more specific because it explicitly states that the read is occurring *after* the targeted buffer. CWE-130 (Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency) can lead to out-of-bounds reads, creating a chain.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe130[\"CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\"]\n    \n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe125\n    cwe130 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe126\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe126 primary\n    class cwe125,cwe130 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect boundary checks** (potentially due to **improper handling of length parameter inconsistency**, CWE-130), which leads to a **buffer over-read** (CWE-126), and can result in **arbitrary code execution**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed to CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read) as the primary weakness. The description clearly states a **buffer over-read** due to incorrect boundary checks in the inflections parser within the `libmobi` library. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause is **incorrect boundary checks**, allowing the parser to read beyond allocated memory.\n\nThe selection of CWE-126 is based on the following evidence:\n*   The vulnerability description explicitly states \"**Buffer Over-read**\".\n*   The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"The vulnerability stems from incorrect boundary checks in the inflections parser within the `libmobi` library. This leads to a stack **buffer over-read** when processing corrupt input.\"\n*   The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"The primary weakness is a **buffer over-read** vulnerability in the `mobi_decode_infl` function. **Incorrect bounds checking** allows the parser to read beyond allocated memory when handling specially crafted or corrupt input.\"\n\nCWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) was considered but deemed less specific. While CWE-126 is a child of CWE-125, the description of CWE-126 explicitly mentions reading *after* the buffer, which aligns more closely with the vulnerability description.\n\nCWE-130 (Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency) was also considered because the **incorrect boundary checks** suggest a potential issue with handling length parameters. This CWE could potentially *precede* the **buffer over-read**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause and the immediate consequence of the vulnerability. CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read) is a variant-level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as
