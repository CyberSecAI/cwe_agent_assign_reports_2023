CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119, making it a more specific and appropriate choice given the detailed description of the vulnerability as a heap buffer overflow. Additionally, CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) can lead to buffer overflows if input quantities, such as size, are not validated correctly.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe1284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **improper input validation** (CWE-1284), where the size of the table border is not properly checked. This **lack of validation** leads to a **heap buffer overflow** (CWE-787) when rendering the table row, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution and denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The description clearly indicates a **heap buffer overflow** in the `render_table_row()` function, making CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) a strong candidate. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section further supports this by stating: \"The primary vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow, specifically in the `render_table_row()` function.\"\n\nThe retriever results also pointed to CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). However, the mapping guidance for CWE-119 discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available. Given that a **heap buffer overflow** is explicitly mentioned, CWE-787, a child of CWE-119, is a more appropriate and specific choice.\n\nAdditionally, the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" mentions \"Insufficient Input Validation,\" suggesting that the code does not properly validate the `border` attribute of the HTML `<table>` tag. This led to the consideration of CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) as a secondary CWE, since the border size could be considered a specified quantity.\n\nThe final decision to assign CWE-787 as the primary CWE and CWE-1284 as a secondary CWE is based on the evidence of a **heap buffer overflow** and **insufficient input validation**. Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Why Not Selected**: While related to buffer overflows, the root cause isn't necessarily an incorrect calculation, but rather a missing validation.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Why Not Selected**: There's no evidence of integer underflow.\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Why Not Selected**: While related, the core issue is the out-of-bounds write due to missing validation.\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\n\n**Why Not Selected**: The vulnerability description specifies a heap buffer overflow, which is an out-of-bounds write.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Why Not Selected**: The vulnerability description specifies a heap buffer overflow, which is an out-of-bounds write.\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n**Why Not Selected**: The vulnerability description specifies a heap buffer overflow, which is an out-of-bounds write that goes past the buffer, not before.\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n\n**Why Not Selected**: While possible, there's no specific evidence of an off-by-one error.\n\n## CWE-127: Buffer Under-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations prior to the targeted buffer.\n\n**Why Not Selected**: The vulnerability description specifies a heap buffer overflow, which is an out-of-bounds write.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
