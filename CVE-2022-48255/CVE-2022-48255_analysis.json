CWE-77 is a class which is child of CWE-74. CWE-20 and CWE-184 are related as CWE-184 is a specific type of input validation issue and can precede CWE-78.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: OS Command Injection\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Command Injection\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe184[\"CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe77 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe184 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe78\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe78\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe20,cwe184 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** or an **incomplete list of disallowed inputs**, leading to **OS command injection**, and finally resulting in **remote code execution**.\n  - Improper/Incomplete Input Validation (CWE-20, CWE-184) -> OS Command Injection (CWE-78) -> Remote Code Execution (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified a **system command injection** vulnerability. The evidence includes vulnerability descriptions, key phrases, and CVE reference links summarizing the root cause as **improper filtering of special characters in external input**.\n\nThe primary selection is CWE-78, which accurately describes the vulnerability. The Retriever Results also suggested considering CWE-77, CWE-20, CWE-88, CWE-94, and CWE-184.\n\nCWE-78 is the most specific and appropriate choice due to the presence of **OS command injection**, aligning with the vulnerability description and content summary.\n\nThe final decision is strongly based on the evidence provided, indicating **improper filtering of special characters** leading to **OS command injection**, and the specificity of CWE-78.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
