CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a Class-level CWE, while CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) is a more specific Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-863. Although CWE-639 is a closer match based on the description, the vulnerability description does not include a user-controlled key, so CWE-863 is a better fit. CWE-359 is related as an impact, the exposure of information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe639 -->|ChildOf| cwe863\n    cwe863 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|ChildOf| cwe284\n    cwe359 -->|ChildOf| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe359 secondary\n    class cwe639,cwe285,cwe284,cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Incorrect Access Control**, leading to the exposure of sensitive information.\n\n1.  **Incorrect Access Control** (Root Cause): The asset handling mechanism **fails to properly** restrict access to personal information via web sockets.\n2.  Information Disclosure (Impact): A logged-in attacker can **fetch personal data of other users**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on **Incorrect Access Control** as the root cause, with the exposure of personal data being the impact. The Retriever results suggested several relevant CWEs, including CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key), and CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor).\n\nThe decision to select CWE-863 as the primary CWE is based on the fact that the application performs an authorization check, but the check is not correctly performed. \"Zammads asset handling mechanism has logic to ensure that customer users are not able to see personal information of other users. This logic was not effective when used through a web socket connection\".\n\nCWE-359 is a good secondary candidate because the **impact** of the vulnerability is \"fetch personal data of other users\".\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by illustrating the hierarchical structure, helping to choose the most appropriate level of specificity. CWE-863 is more appropriate than CWE-284 because it describes the authorization check, but the check does not work as designed.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
