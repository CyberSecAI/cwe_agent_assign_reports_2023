CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).

The vulnerability description key phrases also confirm this.\n\nThe retriever results suggest CWE-119 and CWE-190, but the description explicitly mentions \"heap-based\", making CWE-122 the most appropriate choice. CWE-122 is more specific than its parent CWE-787, and is the most accurate representation of the vulnerability. The evidence supports this, and the mapping guidance allows for CWE-122 usage.\n\nThe **Vulnerability Description** states: \"A **heap-based buffer overflow** could occur while parsing TIFF, PICT, TGA, or RLC files.\"\nThe **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** states: \" **weakness:** **heap-based buffer overflow**\"\nThe **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** states: \"A heap-based buffer overflow can occur in the Autodesk Image Processing component while parsing TIFF, PICT, TGA, or RLC files.\"\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
