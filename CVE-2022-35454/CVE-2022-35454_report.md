# Summary
| CWE ID  | CWE Name  | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.7 | Variant | Secondary | Allowed |
| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.4 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-787 (**Out-of-bounds Write**), which is a base-level CWE. CWE-122 (**Heap-based Buffer Overflow**) is a variant of CWE-787, specifying the location of the buffer. CWE-119 (**Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**) is a class-level CWE, which is too general. CWE-122 is more specific than CWE-119 but less specific than CWE-787.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is as follows:
1.  **Heap-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-787)** due to **improper** bounds checking.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis strongly points to a **heap-buffer overflow**, and the primary CWE match confirms CWE-787 (**Out-of-bounds Write**). The description indicates a write operation outside the intended buffer bounds.

The vulnerability description explicitly states "**heap-buffer overflow**," indicating a buffer overflow occurring in the heap memory region. This directly corresponds to CWE-787 (**Out-of-bounds Write**).

The retriever results also suggest CWE-119 (**Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**), CWE-190 (**Integer Overflow or Wraparound**), CWE-122 (**Heap-based Buffer Overflow**), and CWE-125 (**Out-of-bounds Read**). However, CWE-119 is a class-level CWE and too general, as the description clearly indicates a write (**heap-buffer overflow**). CWE-190 is not relevant since there is no indication of integer overflow. CWE-125 indicates a read, and the vulnerability description is a write (**heap-buffer overflow**).

CWE-122 (**Heap-based Buffer Overflow**) is a more specific variant that indicates the location of the buffer, but the root cause is the write itself.

The final decision is to use CWE-787 (**Out-of-bounds Write**) as the primary CWE, as this best describes the **heap-buffer overflow** vulnerability.
