## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission check**, leading to the exposure of credentials stored in Vault.

`Missing Authorization` -> `Exposure of Credentials`

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **missing permission check**. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions this **missing check**, and the CVE reference summary confirms it. This leads directly to the ability to obtain credentials.

The retriever results strongly suggested CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization], and the description of CWE-862 aligns well with the vulnerability: "The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action." The "attacker with Overall/Read permission to obtain credentials stored in Vault with attacker-specified path and keys" is direct evidence that the product does not perform an authorization check.

While CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization] is a Class-level CWE, the evidence doesn't strongly support moving to a more specific Base-level CWE.

CWE-668 [CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere] was considered because the credentials in Vault are exposed to users with insufficient privileges. However, the **missing permission check** is the direct cause, making CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization] more appropriate as the primary CWE. CWE-668 [CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere] is added as a secondary weakness because the end result is that the Vault credentials are exposed to the wrong sphere.

## Vulnerability Description
A **missing permission check** in Jenkins HashiCorp Vault Plugin 354.vdb_858fd6b_f48 and earlier allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to obtain credentials stored in Vault with attacker-specified path and keys.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **missing permission check**
- **impact:** obtain credentials stored in Vault with attacker-specified path and keys
- **attacker:** attackers with Overall/Read permission
- **product:** Jenkins HashiCorp Vault Plugin
- **version:** 354.vdb_858fd6b_f48 and earlier

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-36888:

**CVE-2022-36888**

*   **Vulnerable Component:** HashiCorp Vault Plugin for Jenkins
*   **Affected Versions:** 354.vdb\_858fd6b\_f48 and earlier
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints responsible for testing Vault connections.
*   **Weaknesses:** Missing permission checks on HTTP endpoints related to Vault connection tests.
*  **Impact:** Attackers with Overall/Read permission can obtain credentials stored in Vault by specifying paths and keys. This allows them to retrieve sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, API keys, etc., stored in HashiCorp Vault.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based exploitation via HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.
    *   The attacker needs to be aware of the existence of the vulnerable endpoints and how to interact with them.
    *   The attacker needs knowledge of the paths and keys of the desired credentials stored in Vault.

**Summary:**
The HashiCorp Vault Plugin for Jenkins allows users with Overall/Read permissions to retrieve credentials stored in Vault by sending crafted HTTP requests with specified paths and keys due to the lack of proper permission checks. This could lead to sensitive information disclosure if an attacker obtains valid Vault paths and keys. The fixed version (355.v3b\_38d767a\_b\_a\_8) requires Overall/Administer permission to perform Vault connection tests.

## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description


Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.


When access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.


### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
