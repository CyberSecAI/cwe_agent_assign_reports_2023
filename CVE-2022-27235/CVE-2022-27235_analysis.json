The evidence points towards an authorization issue, making CWE-639 a reasonable candidate, although the description is not specific enough to rule out other possibilities within the access control domain.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe1390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe639,cwe863,cwe1390,cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with a **Broken Access Control** issue. The absence of proper authorization checks allows an unprivileged user to perform actions requiring higher privileges, potentially leading to unauthorized modification of website content or settings.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Broken Access Control** due to lack of authorization checks\n  - **Weakness:** Unprivileged user can execute higher privileged actions\n  - **Impact:** Unauthorized modification of website content, settings, or data\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **Broken Access Control** as the primary issue. The analysis considered the relationships between CWEs, with CWE-284 being a high-level categorization. The retriever results suggested CWE-639, CWE-863, CWE-1390, and CWE-287 as potential matches. Given the available evidence, CWE-284 is too general, and while CWE-639 is a possibility, the lack of specific details makes it difficult to confirm. The final decision is based on the vulnerability description and the retriever results.\n\nThe evidence provided in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states: \"The vulnerability is due to a **Broken Access Control** issue within the 'Social Share Buttons by Supsystic' WordPress plugin. Specifically, there's a lack of proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to perform actions that should require higher privileges.\"\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity based on the provided evidence. While more specific CWEs might exist, the current information is insufficient to make a more precise determination.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* This CWE does not align with the **Broken Access Control** issue described in the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This CWE is not related to the **Broken Access Control** issue.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* While the description mentions missing authentication checks, the primary issue is **Broken Access Control**, not an incorrect implementation of an authentication algorithm.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This CWE is not directly relevant to the **Broken Access Control** issue described.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
