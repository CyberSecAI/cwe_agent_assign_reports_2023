CWE-362 is a Class-level CWE, and the description fits the **race condition** described in the vulnerability. The relationships between CWE-362 and other CWEs, like CWE-667 (Improper Locking), suggest potential causes or related issues. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-415 (Double Free) represent potential impacts of the **race condition**, as mentioned in the vulnerability description (\"unexpected application termination or heap corruption\"). The abstraction levels were considered to choose the most specific CWE possible.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe415[\"CWE-415: Double Free\"]\n\n    cwe667 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    cwe787 <--|CANFOLLOW| cwe362\n    cwe415 <--|CANFOLLOW| cwe362\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe667,cwe787,cwe415 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **race condition** (CWE-362) arising from concurrent execution and improper synchronization. This can lead to memory corruption, manifested as either an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) or a double free (CWE-415), ultimately causing unexpected application termination. The provided information clearly indicates the initial **race condition** and the resulting impacts.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis, supported by the retriever results and the vulnerability description, points to CWE-362 as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description clearly states \"A **race condition** was addressed with improved locking,\" indicating the root cause. The description also mentions \"unexpected application termination or heap corruption,\" which could be linked to memory corruption issues like out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) or double free (CWE-415), but those are impacts. The graph relationships confirm that CWE-667 could be related, as improper locking can lead to **race conditions**.\n\nThe decision to map CWE-362 as the primary weakness is based on the explicit mention of a **race condition** in both the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The other CWEs considered represent potential consequences or contributing factors but are not the direct root cause as clearly indicated in the provided evidence.
