It is related to CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) through ChildOf relationships. The choice of CWE-862 is driven by its direct match to the \"**missing permission check**\" described in the vulnerability. While CWE-862 is a Class, the evidence does not suggest a more specific Base or Variant is needed. The alternative CWEs considered were related to resource handling and initialization, but these did not directly address the **root cause** of authorization bypass.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|ChildOf| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a single point:\n  - **Root Cause:** **Missing permission check** (CWE-862)\n  - **Impact:** Local information disclosure\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the provided vulnerability description, which clearly indicated a **missing permission check** as the **root cause**. This aligns directly with CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). The retriever results and similar CVE descriptions also pointed towards CWE-862 as a strong candidate.\n\nThe analysis considered alternative CWEs from the retriever results, but these were deemed less relevant due to their focus on buffer overflows, resource handling, or other issues not directly related to the authorization failure.\n\nThe final decision to map to CWE-862 was based on the clear evidence of a **missing permission check**, which directly matches the CWE description. The provided information doesn't give rise to a more detailed child CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
