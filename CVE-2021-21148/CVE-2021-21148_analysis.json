CWE-122 (**Heap-based Buffer Overflow**) is a variant of CWE-787, providing more specific information about the location of the buffer. CWE-119 (**Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**) is a class-level CWE that is a parent of both CWE-787 and CWE-122. Choosing CWE-787 provides a balance between specificity and accuracy based on the available information. While CWE-122 is more specific, the description focuses on the out-of-bounds write rather than the heap location, making CWE-787 the better primary choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe122,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **heap buffer overflow** (**ROOTCAUSE**). This leads to a potential exploit of heap corruption and arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed towards CWE-787 (**Out-of-bounds Write**) as the primary weakness, given the description's focus on a **heap buffer overflow**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the root cause as \"**Heap buffer overflow** in the V8 JavaScript engine,\" further solidifying this choice.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-119 (**Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**), CWE-190 (**Integer Overflow or Wraparound**), and CWE-122 (**Heap-based Buffer Overflow**). However, CWE-119 is discouraged due to its generality, and CWE-190 is not directly supported by the evidence. CWE-122 is a strong candidate as a secondary CWE since the buffer is allocated on the heap.\n\nThe decision to prioritize CWE-787 is based on the specific **weakness** identified in the vulnerability description and the supporting evidence from the CVE reference. The graph relationships reinforce the understanding that CWE-787 is a more specific instance of CWE-119, making it a more appropriate choice.\n\nCWE-787 is selected as the primary CWE because it accurately represents the **out-of-bounds write** condition. CWE-122 is added as a secondary CWE to specify the location of the buffer on the heap. CWE-119 is considered but used with caution because it is a more general class of weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in
