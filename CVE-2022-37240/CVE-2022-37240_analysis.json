CWE-113 is more specific, focusing on HTTP headers, which aligns directly with the vulnerability description. CWE-79, while related in terms of potential impact (XSS), is a broader category and less directly tied to the root cause of the HTTP response splitting. The `CanPrecede` relationship between CWE-113 and CWE-79 suggests that the HTTP response splitting could lead to XSS, but the primary weakness is the improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe93\n    cwe113 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe113 primary\n    class cwe93,cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input sanitization**, leading to **HTTP response splitting**. This then allows for arbitrary header injection and potentially XSS (though not directly exploitable in this case due to file downloading).\n\nRoot Cause: **Improper input sanitization** of CRLF sequences.\nWeakness: **HTTP Response Splitting** (CWE-113).\nImpact: Arbitrary Header Injection, Potential XSS (CWE-79).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed towards CWE-113 due to the **improper neutralization** of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"HTTP Response splitting via the format parameter,\" aligning perfectly with CWE-113's focus. While CWE-79 was considered due to its prevalence in similar CVE descriptions and the potential for XSS, the primary issue is the header manipulation enabled by the CRLF injection. The final decision prioritizes CWE-113 as the root cause. The provided information confirms that the vulnerability lies in the **failure to sanitize** carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) characters before including data in outgoing HTTP headers.\nThe selection of CWE-113 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **improper neutralization** of CRLF sequences within HTTP headers, which is the core of the vulnerability.\nCWE-79 is a potential consequence, but the initial flaw is the CRLF injection.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n### Extended Description\nHTTP agents or components may include a web server, load balancer, reverse proxy, web caching proxy, application firewall, web browser, etc. Regardless of the role, they are expected to maintain coherent, consistent HTTP communication state across all components. However, including unexpected data in an HTTP header allows an attacker to specify the entirety of the HTTP message that is rendered by the client HTTP agent (e.g., web browser) or back-end HTTP agent (e.g., web server), whether the message is part of a request or a response.\n\nWhen an HTTP request contains unexpected CR and LF characters, the server may respond with an output stream that is interpreted as \"splitting\" the stream into two different HTTP messages instead of one. CR is carriage return, also given by %0d or \\r, and LF is line feed, also given by %0a or \\n.\n\nIn addition to CR and LF characters, other valid/RFC compliant special characters and unique character encodings can be utilized, such as HT (horizontal tab, also given by %09 or \\t) and SP (space, also given as + sign or %20).\n\nThese types of unvalidated and unexpected data in HTTP message headers allow an attacker to control the second \"split\" message to mount attacks such as server-side request forgery, cross-site scripting, and cache poisoning attacks.\n\nHTTP response splitting weaknesses may be present when:\n\n1.  Data enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request.\n2.  The data is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web user without neutralizing malicious characters that can be interpreted as separator characters for headers.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-93\nCanPrecede -> CWE-79\n\n**Evidence:** The vulnerability description states that the vulnerability is an HTTP Response splitting via the format parameter. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states that the root cause is the **failure to sanitize** carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) characters before including data in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n**Evidence:** The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states that the HTTP Response Splitting vulnerability can be chained with XSS.",
