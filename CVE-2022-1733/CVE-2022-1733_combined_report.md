# Analysis for CVE-2022-1733

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-787, which is a base-level CWE. CWE-787 is a parent of CWE-124 (Buffer Underwrite) and has peer relationships with other buffer-related CWEs. The retriever results suggest CWE-119, CWE-190, and CWE-122 as possibilities, but the explicit mention of a **heap-based buffer overflow** and an **out-of-bounds read** in the vulnerability descriptions, along with the CWE-787 mapping for similar CVEs, makes CWE-787 the most accurate selection as the primary CWE, potentially paired with CWE-125.

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **heap-based buffer overflow** which leads to an **out-of-bounds write**. This can potentially be triggered by reading past the end of the line when C-indenting. The chain is:
1.  **Heap-based Buffer Overflow**/**Out-of-bounds read** (Root Cause)
2.  **Out-of-bounds Write** (CWE-787) (Impact)

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description and similar CVE mappings, pointed towards CWE-787 (**Out-of-bounds Write**) as the primary weakness. The retriever results suggested considering CWE-119 (**Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**), CWE-190 (**Integer Overflow or Wraparound**), and CWE-122 (**Heap-based Buffer Overflow**). However, the specific context of the vulnerability, particularly the reference links indicating an **out-of-bounds read** and a **heap-based buffer overflow** due to reading past the end of a line during C-indenting, strongly supports CWE-787 as the direct result of the buffer overflow.

The final decision is heavily based on the following evidence:

*   The vulnerability description explicitly states "Heap-based Buffer Overflow".
*   The "CWE for similar CVE Descriptions" section lists CWE-787 as the "Primary CWE Match".
*   The CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicates an **out-of-bounds read** and a **heap-based buffer overflow** in `cindent.c` due to reading past the end of the line.

Given this evidence, CWE-787 is the most accurate and specific classification. Additionally, since there is an **out-of-bounds read**, CWE-125 is added as a secondary CWE.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-118
ChildOf -> CWE-20

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist




## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Overflow: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
Wraparound: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
wrap, wrap-around, wrap around: Alternate spellings of "wraparound"

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-20
CanPrecede -> CWE-119

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with "overflow," "underflow," and "wraparound" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called "underflows").


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.

**[Terminology]** 

"Integer overflow" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.


A "wraparound" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.


"Overflow" is sometimes conflated with "wraparound" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.


The "overflow" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use "overflow" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using "underflow" for exceeding the minimum.


Some people use "overflow" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses "underflow" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.


See [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.


**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.




## CWE-1222: Insufficient Granularity of Address Regions Protected by Register Locks
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product defines a large address region protected from modification by the same register lock control bit. This results in a conflict between the functional requirement that some addresses need to be writable by software during operation and the security requirement that the system configuration lock bit must be set during the boot process.

### Extended Description


Integrated circuits and hardware IPs can expose the device configuration controls that need to be programmed after device power reset by a trusted firmware or software module (commonly set by BIOS/bootloader) and then locked from any further modification. In hardware design, this is commonly implemented using a programmable lock bit which enables/disables writing to a protected set of registers or address regions. When the programmable lock bit is set, the relevant address region can be implemented as a hardcoded value in hardware logic that cannot be changed later.


A problem can arise wherein the protected region definition is not granular enough. After the programmable lock bit has been set, then this new functionality cannot be implemented without change to the hardware design.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1220

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use






## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.

### Extended Description
This typically occurs when the pointer or its index is incremented to a position beyond the bounds of the buffer or when pointer arithmetic results in a position outside of the valid memory location to name a few. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-125
ChildOf -> CWE-788

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** These problems may be resultant from missing sentinel values (CWE-463) or trusting a user-influenced input length variable.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-1733:** Text editor has out-of-bounds read past end of line while indenting C code
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated, leading to buffer over-read or heap-based buffer overflow.




## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-788
ChildOf -> CWE-787

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Heap-based buffer overflows are usually just as dangerous as stack-based buffer overflows.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268:** Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).




## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.

### Extended Description
This typically occurs when a pointer or its index is decremented to a position before the buffer, when pointer arithmetic results in a position before the beginning of the valid memory location, or when a negative index is used.

### Alternative Terms
buffer underrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer underrun". "Buffer underflow" is more commonly used, although both terms are also sometimes used to describe a buffer under-read (CWE-127).

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-786
ChildOf -> CWE-787

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This could be resultant from several errors, including a bad offset or an array index that decrements before the beginning of the buffer (see CWE-129).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-24018:** buffer underwrite in firmware verification routine allows code execution via a crafted firmware image
- **CVE-2002-2227:** Unchecked length of SSLv2 challenge value leads to buffer underflow.
- **CVE-2007-4580:** Buffer underflow from a small size value with a large buffer (length parameter inconsistency, CWE-130)




## CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

### Extended Description
A buffer overflow condition exists when a product attempts to put more data in a buffer than it can hold, or when it attempts to put data in a memory area outside of the boundaries of a buffer. The simplest type of error, and the most common cause of buffer overflows, is the "classic" case in which the product copies the buffer without restricting how much is copied. Other variants exist, but the existence of a classic overflow strongly suggests that the programmer is not considering even the most basic of security protections.

### Alternative Terms
Classic Buffer Overflow: This term was frequently used by vulnerability researchers during approximately 1995 to 2005 to differentiate buffer copies without length checks (which had been known about for decades) from other emerging weaknesses that still involved invalid accesses of buffers, as vulnerability researchers began to develop advanced exploitation techniques.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-119
ChildOf -> CWE-119
ChildOf -> CWE-119
ChildOf -> CWE-119
CanPrecede -> CWE-123
ChildOf -> CWE-20

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** There are some indications that this CWE ID might be misused and selected simply because it mentions "buffer overflow" - an increasingly vague term. This CWE entry is only appropriate for "Buffer Copy" operations (not buffer reads), in which where there is no "Checking [the] Size of Input", and (by implication of the copy) writing past the end of the buffer.
**Comments:** If the vulnerability being analyzed involves out-of-bounds reads, then consider CWE-125 or descendants. For root cause analysis: if there is any input validation, consider children of CWE-20 such as CWE-1284. If there is a calculation error for buffer sizes, consider CWE-131 or similar.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** At the code level, stack-based and heap-based overflows do not differ significantly, so there usually is not a need to distinguish them. From the attacker perspective, they can be quite different, since different techniques are required to exploit them.

**[Terminology]** Many issues that are now called "buffer overflows" are substantively different than the "classic" overflow, including entirely different bug types that rely on overflow exploit techniques, such as integer signedness errors, integer overflows, and format string bugs. This imprecise terminology can make it difficult to determine which variant is being reported.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2000-1094:** buffer overflow using command with long argument
- **CVE-1999-0046:** buffer overflow in local program using long environment variable
- **CVE-2002-1337:** buffer overflow in comment characters, when product increments a counter for a ">" but does not decrement for "<"




## CWE-786: Access of Memory Location Before Start of Buffer
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.

### Extended Description
This typically occurs when a pointer or its index is decremented to a position before the buffer, when pointer arithmetic results in a position before the beginning of the valid memory location, or when a negative index is used.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-119
ChildOf -> CWE-119
ChildOf -> CWE-119

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available. It also overlaps existing CWE entries and might be deprecated in the future.
**Comments:** If the "Access" operation is known to be a read or a write, then investigate children of entries such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write and CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read.
**Reasons:**
- Potential Deprecation
- Frequent Misuse



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-2227:** Unchecked length of SSLv2 challenge value leads to buffer underflow.
- **CVE-2007-4580:** Buffer underflow from a small size value with a large buffer (length parameter inconsistency, CWE-130)
- **CVE-2007-1584:** Buffer underflow from an all-whitespace string, which causes a counter to be decremented before the buffer while looking for a non-whitespace character.




## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-20
ChildOf -> CWE-20
CanPrecede -> CWE-789

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2008-1440:** lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop
- **CVE-2008-2374:** lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read




## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.

### Extended Description
If an attacker can manipulate the length parameter associated with an input such that it is inconsistent with the actual length of the input, this can be leveraged to cause the target application to behave in unexpected, and possibly, malicious ways. One of the possible motives for doing so is to pass in arbitrarily large input to the application. Another possible motivation is the modification of application state by including invalid data for subsequent properties of the application. Such weaknesses commonly lead to attacks such as buffer overflows and execution of arbitrary code.

### Alternative Terms
length manipulation
length tampering

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-240
ChildOf -> CWE-119
ChildOf -> CWE-119
CanPrecede -> CWE-805

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This probably overlaps other categories including zero-length issues.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
- **CVE-2009-2299:** Web application firewall consumes excessive memory when an HTTP request contains a large Content-Length value but no POST data.
- **CVE-2001-0825:** Buffer overflow in internal string handling routine allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a length argument of zero or less, which disables the length check.
