# Analysis for CVE-2021-46828

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-772 | Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-775 | Missing Release of File Descriptor or Handle after Effective Lifetime | 0.8 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-772 (Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime), which is a base-level CWE. A more specific variant, CWE-775 (Missing Release of File Descriptor or Handle after Effective Lifetime), was considered as a secondary candidate, since the resource in question is a file descriptor. CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a higher-level class CWE that describes the impact of the resource leak.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **mishandled idle TCP connections**, which leads to **missing poll timeout handling** and **missing EMFILE error handling**. This results in the **exhaustion of file descriptors** and an **svc_run infinite loop**, ultimately causing a denial of service.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on the **mishandling of idle TCP connections** and the resulting **resource exhaustion**. The evidence from the CVE reference links confirms that the **root cause** is the **missing handling of poll timeouts** and `EMFILE` errors. This leads to a situation where the system's open file descriptor limit is reached, causing a denial of service.

CWE-772 (Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime) is the most appropriate primary CWE because it directly addresses the **failure to release resources** (idle TCP connections) after their effective lifetime. The vulnerability description explicitly states that "remote attackers could exhaust the file descriptors of a process... because **idle TCP connections are mishandled**." The **mishandling** leads to these connections not being properly released, aligning perfectly with CWE-772.

CWE-775 (Missing Release of File Descriptor or Handle after Effective Lifetime) is a more specific variant of CWE-772, as it focuses on file descriptors. Given that the vulnerability ultimately leads to the exhaustion of file descriptors, CWE-775 could also be considered. However, the broader issue is the mishandling of TCP connections which leads to the failure to release them, making CWE-772 the more direct mapping.

CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) describes the impact of the vulnerability (denial of service) rather than the **root cause**. While resource exhaustion is a consequence, the underlying issue is the **failure to release resources** after they are no longer needed.

The selection of CWE-772 as the primary CWE is based on the following evidence:

*   The vulnerability description's focus on **mishandled idle TCP connections**.
*   The CVE reference links' emphasis on **missing poll timeout handling** and `EMFILE` errors, preventing proper resource release.
*   The direct alignment of CWE-772's description with the **failure to release resources** after their effective lifetime.

The other CWEs were considered but not used as primary mappings because they either represented the impact (CWE-400) or were more specific instances of the primary weakness (CWE-775).

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-46828

## Vulnerability Description
In libtirpc before 1.3.3rc1, remote attackers could exhaust the file descriptors of a process that uses libtirpc because **idle TCP connections are mishandled**. This can, in turn, lead to an svc_run infinite loop without accepting new connections.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **idle TCP connections are mishandled**
- **impact:** exhaust the file descriptors of a process and svc_run infinite loop without accepting new connections
- **attacker:** remote attackers
- **product:** libtirpc
- **version:** before 1.3.3rc1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46828:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper error handling in the `svc_run` function of the `libtirpc` library. Specifically, two issues were introduced by commit b2c9430f46c4:
    - The `svc_run` function no longer handles poll timeouts.
    - The `rendezvous_request` function no longer handles `EMFILE` errors returned by `accept(2)`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Poll Timeout Handling:** The lack of poll timeout handling allows idle TCP connections to remain in the `ESTABLISHED` state indefinitely.
- **Missing EMFILE Error Handling:** When the number of connections reaches the system's open file descriptor limit (`ulimit -n`), the `accept(2)` system call fails with an `EMFILE` error.  The absence of `EMFILE` error handling causes the `svc_run()` function to get stuck in a tight loop, repeatedly calling `accept(2)` without any mechanism to recover.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By establishing a sufficient number of connections to the vulnerable `libtirpc` service, an attacker can exhaust the process's open file descriptor limit.  This will lead to the service becoming unresponsive and unable to accept any new requests. The RPC service becomes unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by establishing TCP connections to the vulnerable service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to establish TCP connections to the server running the vulnerable `libtirpc` service.
- **Multiple Connection Establishment:** The attacker needs to be able to open enough connections to exhaust the server's file descriptor limits.

**Summary of Findings:**

The vulnerability is caused by the removal of timeout and error handling which can be triggered remotely, leading to resource exhaustion and a denial of service.  The content from Gentoo, Debian, and NetApp all refer to the same underlying issue in libtirpc. Specifically, they identify the missing handling of poll timeout and EMFILE errors as the root cause which are exploited by creating multiple connections. The impact is consistently reported as a denial of service.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** "Resource exhaustion" (CWE-400) is currently treated as a weakness, although it is more like a category of weaknesses that all have the same type of consequence. While this entry treats CWE-400 as a parent in view 1000, the relationship is probably more appropriately described as a chain.

**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. "Resource exhaustion" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2007-0897:** Chain: anti-virus product encounters a malformed file but returns from a function without closing a file descriptor (CWE-775) leading to file descriptor consumption (CWE-400) and failed scans.
- **CVE-2001-0830:** Sockets not properly closed when attacker repeatedly connects and disconnects from server.
- **CVE-1999-1127:** Does not shut down named pipe connections if malformed data is sent.




## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.

### Extended Description


Limited resources include memory, file system storage, database connection pool entries, and CPU. If an attacker can trigger the allocation of these limited resources, but the number or size of the resources is not controlled, then the attacker could cause a denial of service that consumes all available resources. This would prevent valid users from accessing the product, and it could potentially have an impact on the surrounding environment. For example, a memory exhaustion attack against an application could slow down the application as well as its host operating system.


There are at least three distinct scenarios which can commonly lead to resource exhaustion:


  - Lack of throttling for the number of allocated resources

  - Losing all references to a resource before reaching the shutdown stage

  - Not closing/returning a resource after processing

Resource exhaustion problems are often result due to an incorrect implementation of the following situations:

  - Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.

  - Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.



### Alternative Terms
Resource Exhaustion

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-664

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the "technical impact" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is causing resource consumption, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake. Consider children/descendants such as CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling, CWE-771: Missing Reference to Active Allocated Resource, CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool, CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime, CWE-834: Excessive Iteration, CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification), and others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** "Resource consumption" could be interpreted as a consequence instead of an insecure behavior, so this entry is being considered for modification. It appears to be referenced too frequently when more precise mappings are available. Some of its children, such as CWE-771, might be better considered as a chain.

**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. "Resource exhaustion" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.

**[Other]** 

Database queries that take a long time to process are good DoS targets. An attacker would have to write a few lines of Perl code to generate enough traffic to exceed the site's ability to keep up. This would effectively prevent authorized users from using the site at all. Resources can be exploited simply by ensuring that the target machine must do much more work and consume more resources in order to service a request than the attacker must do to initiate a request.


A prime example of this can be found in old switches that were vulnerable to "macof" attacks (so named for a tool developed by Dugsong). These attacks flooded a switch with random IP and MAC address combinations, therefore exhausting the switch's cache, which held the information of which port corresponded to which MAC addresses. Once this cache was exhausted, the switch would fail in an insecure way and would begin to act simply as a hub, broadcasting all traffic on all ports and allowing for basic sniffing attacks.


**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2020-7218:** Go-based workload orchestrator does not limit resource usage with unauthenticated connections, allowing a DoS by flooding the service
- **CVE-2020-3566:** Resource exhaustion in distributed OS because of "insufficient" IGMP queue management, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.

### Extended Description


Code frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.

**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).

- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.




## CWE-403: Exposure of File Descriptor to Unintended Control Sphere ('File Descriptor Leak')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A process does not close sensitive file descriptors before invoking a child process, which allows the child to perform unauthorized I/O operations using those descriptors.

### Extended Description
When a new process is forked or executed, the child process inherits any open file descriptors. When the child process has fewer privileges than the parent process, this might introduce a vulnerability if the child process can access the file descriptor but does not have the privileges to access the associated file.

### Alternative Terms
File descriptor leak: While this issue is frequently called a file descriptor leak, the "leak" term is often used in two different ways - exposure of a resource, or consumption of a resource. Use of this term could cause confusion.

## CWE-775: Missing Release of File Descriptor or Handle after Effective Lifetime
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not release a file descriptor or handle after its effective lifetime has ended, i.e., after the file descriptor/handle is no longer needed.

### Extended Description
When a file descriptor or handle is not released after use (typically by explicitly closing it), attackers can cause a denial of service by consuming all available file descriptors/handles, or otherwise preventing other system processes from obtaining their own file descriptors/handles.

## CWE-774: Allocation of File Descriptors or Handles Without Limits or Throttling
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product allocates file descriptors or handles on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on how many descriptors can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.

### Extended Description
This can cause the product to consume all available file descriptors or handles, which can prevent other processes from performing critical file processing operations.

## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

### Extended Description
When product generates predictable values in a context requiring unpredictability, it may be possible for an attacker to guess the next value that will be generated, and use this guess to impersonate another user or access sensitive information.

### Alternative Terms

**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be primary to many other weaknesses such as cryptographic errors, authentication errors, symlink following, information leaks, and others.

**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.3, CWE-330 and its descendants are being investigated by the CWE crypto team to identify gaps related to randomness and unpredictability, as well as the relationships between randomness and cryptographic primitives. This "subtree analysis" might result in the addition or deprecation of existing entries; the reorganization of relationships in some views, e.g. the research view (CWE-1000); more consistent use of terminology; and/or significant modifications to related entries.

**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, "randomness" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-3692:** PHP framework uses mt_rand() function (Marsenne Twister) when generating tokens
- **CVE-2020-7010:** Cloud application on Kubernetes generates passwords using a weak random number generator based on deployment time.
- **CVE-2009-3278:** Crypto product uses rand() library function to generate a recovery key, making it easier to conduct brute force attacks.
