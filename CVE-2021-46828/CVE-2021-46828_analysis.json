A more specific variant, CWE-775 (Missing Release of File Descriptor or Handle after Effective Lifetime), was considered as a secondary candidate, since the resource in question is a file descriptor. CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a higher-level class CWE that describes the impact of the resource leak.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe772[\"CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe775[\"CWE-775: Missing Release of File Descriptor or Handle after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\"]\n\n    cwe772 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    cwe775 -->|CHILDOF| cwe772\n    cwe772 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe772 primary\n    class cwe775,cwe400 secondary\n    class cwe404 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **mishandled idle TCP connections**, which leads to **missing poll timeout handling** and **missing EMFILE error handling**. This results in the **exhaustion of file descriptors** and an **svc_run infinite loop**, ultimately causing a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **mishandling of idle TCP connections** and the resulting **resource exhaustion**. The evidence from the CVE reference links confirms that the **root cause** is the **missing handling of poll timeouts** and `EMFILE` errors. This leads to a situation where the system's open file descriptor limit is reached, causing a denial of service.\n\nCWE-772 (Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime) is the most appropriate primary CWE because it directly addresses the **failure to release resources** (idle TCP connections) after their effective lifetime. The vulnerability description explicitly states that \"remote attackers could exhaust the file descriptors of a process... because **idle TCP connections are mishandled**.\" The **mishandling** leads to these connections not being properly released, aligning perfectly with CWE-772.\n\nCWE-775 (Missing Release of File Descriptor or Handle after Effective Lifetime) is a more specific variant of CWE-772, as it focuses on file descriptors. Given that the vulnerability ultimately leads to the exhaustion of file descriptors, CWE-775 could also be considered. However, the broader issue is the mishandling of TCP connections which leads to the failure to release them, making CWE-772 the more direct mapping.\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) describes the impact of the vulnerability (denial of service) rather than the **root cause**. While resource exhaustion is a consequence, the underlying issue is the **failure to release resources** after they are no longer needed.\n\nThe selection of CWE-772 as the primary CWE is based on the following evidence:\n\n*   The vulnerability description's focus on **mishandled idle TCP connections**.\n*   The CVE reference links' emphasis on **missing poll timeout handling** and `EMFILE` errors, preventing proper resource release.\n*   The direct alignment of CWE-772's description with the **failure to release resources** after their effective lifetime.\n\nThe other CWEs were considered but not used as primary mappings because they either represented the impact (CWE-400) or were more specific instances of the primary weakness (CWE-775).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
