The retriever results also strongly suggest this CWE. The relationships of CWE-266 to its parent, CWE-269 \"Improper Privilege Management\", and its peer, CWE-286 \"Incorrectly Specified Componen\" were considered, but CWE-266 provides the most specific and accurate classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n\n    cwe266 -->|CHILDOF| cwe269\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe266 primary\n    class cwe269 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward: an **incorrect privilege assignment** (CWE-266) leads directly to a local denial of service.
