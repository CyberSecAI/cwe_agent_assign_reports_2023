This reflects the vulnerability's progression from the **integer overflow** to heap corruption.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe122 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) during buffer reallocation, leading to an under-allocated heap chunk. Subsequent writes based on the original buffer size result in heap memory corruption (CWE-122).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly suggests CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) as the primary CWE due to the explicit mention of \"**integer overflow**\" in the vulnerability description and CVE reference details. The vulnerability description states, \"The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of `yajl` contain an **integer overflow** which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing with large (~2GB) inputs.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms this: \"The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `yajl` library's buffer reallocation logic (`yajl_buf.c#L64`).\"\n\nCWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is a secondary CWE because the **integer overflow** leads to heap corruption by writing to an under-allocated heap chunk.\n\nThe selection of CWE-190 is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference, while the selection of CWE-122 is based on the consequence of the overflow. Both CWEs are at appropriate levels of specificity (Base and Variant, respectively).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
