The analysis did not require analysis of parent-child hierarchical relationships, chain relationships, or peer relationships.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe326[\"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe326 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weak cipher configuration**, leading to a man-in-the-middle attacker being able to read and modify data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis and resulting conclusion are based on the provided evidence, which includes the vulnerability description key phrases and the CVE reference links content summary. The key phrase \"weak cipher configuration\" directly indicates a problem with the encryption strength used by the SSH server. The CVE reference links content summary explicitly states \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Inadequate Encryption Strength (CWE-326).\" This clear and direct evidence supports the selection of CWE-326 as the primary CWE.\n\nThe graph relationships did not influence the final selection as the evidence was strong enough to directly map to CWE-326.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability: the **inadequate encryption strength** of the SSH server's configuration.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n*Rationale for Not Selecting*: This CWE is too high-level and doesn't accurately describe the **root cause** which is related to encryption.\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Rationale for Not Selecting*: This CWE does not describe the vulnerability since the issue is not related to isolation but rather the usage of **weak encryption**.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Rationale for Not Selecting*: The issue is not about verifying data authenticity but about the **weak encryption** algorithm being used.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*Rationale for Not Selecting*: This is not an injection issue but rather the usage of **weak encryption**.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Rationale for Not Selecting*: The vulnerability is not related to a list of disallowed inputs, but to the usage of **weak encryption**.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Rationale for Not Selecting*: This CWE is not related to the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The **root cause** is **weak encryption**, and this CWE is not relevant.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Rationale for Not Selecting*: This CWE is too generic and doesn't describe the specific **weakness**. The **root cause** is **weak encryption**.\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Rationale for Not Selecting*: The vulnerability is not related to improper checking for unusual conditions, but to the usage of **weak encryption**.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Rationale for Not Selecting*: The **root cause** is **weak encryption**, and this CWE is not relevant.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Rationale for Not Selecting*: The **root cause** is **weak encryption**, and this CWE is not relevant.\n\n## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 9862.55\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nTwo separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Rationale for Not Selecting*:",
