This hierarchical relationship indicates that the vulnerability is a specific type of out-of-bounds write that occurs on the stack. The relationships confirm that CWE-121 is the most specific and appropriate choice given the available information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe787,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **stack overflow** in the guestWifiRuleRefresh function, triggered by the qosGuestUpstream and qosGuestDownstream parameters, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).\n  - Root Cause: **Stack overflow** due to improper handling of input parameters.\n  - Impact: Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly suggests CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) as the primary CWE due to the explicit mention of a **stack overflow** in the vulnerability description. The vulnerability description key phrases also highlight **stack overflow** as the weakness. The retriever results also list CWE-121 as the top combined result with a score of 1.0.\n\nThe statement \"Tenda routers G1 and G3 v15.11.0.17(9502)_CN were discovered to contain a **stack overflow** in the function guestWifiRuleRefresh\" directly indicates the presence of a stack-based buffer overflow. The attack vector, \"qosGuestUpstream and qosGuestDownstream parameters,\" suggests that the overflow is likely caused by improper handling or validation of these input parameters.\n\nThe relationship analysis confirms that CWE-121 is a variant of more general buffer overflow weaknesses, making it the most specific and appropriate choice. The mapping guidance for CWE-121 also supports its use as it is at the Variant level of abstraction.\n\nCWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is a more general class of weakness. While it could apply, CWE-121 is more specific because the buffer is located on the stack. Therefore, CWE-119 is not the best choice.\n\nCWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) was considered but is not directly related to the stated **stack overflow** condition. There is no evidence in the description to suggest an integer overflow is involved.\n\nCWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion) was considered but is not directly related to the stated **stack overflow**. Uncontrolled recursion can cause a stack exhaustion, but the description indicates a buffer overflow, not a stack exhaustion.\n\nCWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')) was considered but is not related to the stated **stack overflow**. The description does not describe any command injection.\n\nThe selection of CWE-121 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly reflects the **stack overflow** condition described in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or
