## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of XML round-trip issues**, which can lead to an **incorrect document being produced**. This can be seen as a form of **improper encoding or escaping of output** (CWE-116). In some cases, the improper handling of XML can be related to **XML Entity Expansion** (CWE-776) or **XML External Entity Reference** (CWE-611).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on the fact that the REXML gem before certain versions **does not properly address XML round-trip issues**. This means that after parsing and serializing an XML document, an **incorrect document can be produced**.

The Retriever results suggested several CWEs, including CWE-777 (Regular Expression without Anchors), CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output), and CWE-611 (Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference).

CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output) was chosen as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary both point to issues with how the XML data is handled during parsing and serialization. The "XML round-trip issues" suggest that the encoding or escaping mechanisms are not properly preserving the structure of the XML document.

CWE-776 (Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion')) and CWE-611 (Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference) are included as secondary CWEs because they are related to potential issues that can occur when processing XML documents, especially with external or recursive entities. The vulnerability could potentially involve these issues, depending on the specifics of the crafted XML document.

The selection of CWE-116 is based on the evidence that the XML structure is not being preserved during parsing and serialization, indicating an issue with encoding or escaping. The fact that the vulnerability leads to an "incorrect document" further supports this classification. The evidence for CWE-776 and CWE-611 is less direct, but the potential for these issues to be involved in XML processing vulnerabilities justifies their inclusion as secondary CWEs.

The abstraction level of CWE-116 is Class, while CWE-776 and CWE-611 are Base. Ideally, a more specific Variant of CWE-116 would be preferred, but given the available information, the Class level provides a reasonable fit.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-28965:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `REXML` gem (library) bundled with Ruby.
- When parsing and serializing a crafted XML document, `REXML` can create an incorrect XML document with a different structure than the original. This is an XML round-trip vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML Round-Trip Issue:** The core weakness is the failure of `REXML` to correctly preserve the structure of an XML document during parsing and serialization. This means that the XML output is not guaranteed to match the input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Modification:** Successful exploitation can lead to the addition or modification of data due to the altered XML structure.
- **Context-Dependent Impact:** The severity of the impact depends heavily on the context and how the application uses REXML. It might lead to vulnerabilities in programs relying on REXML.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted XML Document:** The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted XML document as input to a vulnerable application using REXML.
- **Parsing and Serialization:** The vulnerability is triggered during the process of parsing the crafted XML document and subsequently serializing it back into XML.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Supply Malicious XML:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious XML document to an application that uses the vulnerable REXML library.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Ruby Versions:**
    - Ruby 2.5.8 or prior (cannot use `gem update rexml`)
    - Ruby 2.6.6 or prior
    - Ruby 2.7.2 or prior
    - Ruby 3.0.0
    - REXML gem 3.2.4 or prior
- **Mitigation:**
    - Upgrade Ruby to versions 2.6.7, 2.7.3, or 3.0.1 or later.
    - Alternatively, update the `rexml` gem to version 3.2.5 or later (except for Ruby 2.5.8 or prior)
- **NetApp Products:** Although the vulnerability is in Ruby, NetApp explicitly states that their products are not affected. This implies they either do not use the vulnerable versions of ruby/REXML or they have mitigated the issue in other ways.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-777: Regular Expression without Anchors
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a regular expression to perform neutralization, but the regular expression is not anchored and may allow malicious or malformed data to slip through.

### Extended Description
When performing tasks such as validating against a set of allowed inputs (allowlist), data is examined and possibly modified to ensure that it is well-formed and adheres to a list of safe values. If the regular expression is not anchored, malicious or malformed data may be included before or after any string matching the regular expression. The type of malicious data that is allowed will depend on the context of the application and which anchors are omitted from the regular expression.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-625

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).




## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

### Extended Description


Improper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.


Most products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" is a structured message containing a command ("GET") with a single argument ("/index.html") and metadata about which protocol version is being used ("HTTP/1.1").


If an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness is primary to all weaknesses related to injection (CWE-74) since the inherent nature of injection involves the violation of structured messages.

**[Relationship]** 

CWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.


However, input validation is not always sufficient, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a last name is inserted into a query. The name "O'Reilly" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the "'" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise neutralized. In this case, stripping the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.


**[Terminology]** The usage of the "encoding" and "escaping" terms varies widely. For example, in some programming languages, the terms are used interchangeably, while other languages provide APIs that use both terms for different tasks. This overlapping usage extends to the Web, such as the "escape" JavaScript function whose purpose is stated to be encoding. The concepts of encoding and escaping predate the Web by decades. Given such a context, it is difficult for CWE to adopt a consistent vocabulary that will not be misinterpreted by some constituency.

**[Theoretical]** This is a data/directive boundary error in which data boundaries are not sufficiently enforced before it is sent to a different control sphere.

**[Research Gap]** While many published vulnerabilities are related to insufficient output encoding, there is such an emphasis on input validation as a protection mechanism that the underlying causes are rarely described. Within CVE, the focus is primarily on well-understood issues like cross-site scripting and SQL injection. It is likely that this weakness frequently occurs in custom protocols that support multiple encodings, which are not necessarily detectable with automated techniques.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-41232:** Chain: authentication routine in Go-based agile development product does not escape user name (CWE-116), allowing LDAP injection (CWE-90)
- **CVE-2008-4636:** OS command injection in backup software using shell metacharacters in a filename; correct behavior would require that this filename could not be changed.
- **CVE-2008-0769:** Web application does not set the charset when sending a page to a browser, allowing for XSS exploitation when a browser chooses an unexpected encoding.




## CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

### Extended Description


XML documents optionally contain a Document Type Definition (DTD), which, among other features, enables the definition of XML entities. It is possible to define an entity by providing a substitution string in the form of a URI. The XML parser can access the contents of this URI and embed these contents back into the XML document for further processing.


By submitting an XML file that defines an external entity with a file:// URI, an attacker can cause the processing application to read the contents of a local file. For example, a URI such as "file:///c:/winnt/win.ini" designates (in Windows) the file C:\Winnt\win.ini, or file:///etc/passwd designates the password file in Unix-based systems. Using URIs with other schemes such as http://, the attacker can force the application to make outgoing requests to servers that the attacker cannot reach directly, which can be used to bypass firewall restrictions or hide the source of attacks such as port scanning.


Once the content of the URI is read, it is fed back into the application that is processing the XML. This application may echo back the data (e.g. in an error message), thereby exposing the file contents.

## CWE-776: Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses XML documents and allows their structure to be defined with a Document Type Definition (DTD), but it does not properly control the number of recursive definitions of entities.

### Extended Description
If the DTD contains a large number of nested or recursive entities, this can lead to explosive growth of data when parsed, causing a denial of service.

### Alternative Terms
XEE: XEE is the acronym commonly used for XML Entity Expansion.
Billion Laughs Attack
XML Bomb: While the "XML Bomb" term was used in the early years of knowledge of this issue, the XEE term seems to be more commonly used.

## CWE-1322: Use of Blocking Code in Single-threaded, Non-blocking Context
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a non-blocking model that relies on a single threaded process
			for features such as scalability, but it contains code that can block when it is invoked.

### Extended Description


When an attacker can directly invoke the blocking code, or the blocking code can be affected by environmental conditions that can be influenced by an attacker, then this can lead to a denial of service by causing unexpected hang or freeze of the code. Examples of blocking code might be an expensive computation or calling blocking library calls, such as those that perform exclusive file operations or require a successful network operation.


Due to limitations in multi-thread models, single-threaded models are used to overcome the resource constraints that are caused by using many threads. In such a model, all code should generally be non-blocking. If blocking code is called, then the event loop will effectively be stopped, which can be undesirable or dangerous. Such models are used in Python asyncio, Vert.x, and Node.js, or other custom event loop code.

## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.

### Extended Description


Often, complex inputs are expected to follow a particular syntax, which is either assumed by the input itself, or declared within metadata such as headers. The syntax could be for data exchange formats, markup languages, or even programming languages. When untrusted input is not properly validated for the expected syntax, attackers could cause parsing failures, trigger unexpected errors, or expose latent vulnerabilities that might not be directly exploitable if the input had conformed to the syntax.

- **CVE-2022-35411:** Python-based RPC framework enables pickle functionality by default, allowing clients to unpickle untrusted data.




## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.
