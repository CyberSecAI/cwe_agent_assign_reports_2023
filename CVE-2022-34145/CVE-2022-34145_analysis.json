Additionally, CWE-126 is also a ChildOf CWE-788 (Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer). The relationship between CWE-805 and CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) indicates that CWE-805 is related to improper buffer operation restrictions which can lead to over-reads.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe788[\"CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\"]\n    cwe805[\"CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe125\n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe788\n    cwe805 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe126 primary\n    class cwe805 secondary\n    class cwe125,cwe788,cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves a **buffer over-read** leading to a denial of service. The root cause is likely related to how the WLAN host parses frame information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the vulnerability description which states \"Transient DOS due to **buffer over-read** in WLAN Host while parsing frame information\".\n\nThe term \"**buffer over-read**\" directly corresponds to CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read). The description of CWE-126, \"The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer,\" aligns with the provided vulnerability.\n\nThe retriever results also support this, listing CWE-126 as the top combined result with a score of 0.191.\n\nThe relationships highlight how CWE-126 is a specific type of out-of-bounds read, making it a more accurate classification than its parent CWE-125.\n\nCWE-805 (Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value) was considered as a secondary CWE because the **buffer over-read** could be caused by an incorrect length value, which is described in CWE-805 as \"The product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\"\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n* CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound): While integer overflows can lead to buffer overflows, there is no direct evidence of an integer overflow in the vulnerability description.\n* CWE-909 (Missing Initialization of Resource): There is no evidence suggesting missing resource initialization.\n* CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input): While improper input validation of quantity might lead to **buffer over-read**, there is no direct evidence.\n* CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow): Though possible, there is no explicit mention of a heap-based buffer, making CWE-126 a better fit.\n\nThe selection of CWE-126 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the **buffer over-read** condition leading to denial of service.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n- CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value",
