Due to its broad nature, it's often misused, but it aligns with the vulnerability's impact of processing delays to iControl REST requests. CWE-400 has several child CWEs that were also considered, such as CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling), but the provided vulnerability description does not specify the type of resource that is being consumed without control, so the more general CWE-400 seems more appropriate. Another child of CWE-400, CWE-405 (Asymmetric Resource Consumption), was also considered but does not fit the description as well.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe799[\"CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe405[\"CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe405 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe799 -->|PEEROF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe799,cwe770,cwe405 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an authenticated iControl REST user with at least guest role privileges making undisclosed requests. The **IMPACT** of these requests is processing delays to iControl REST requests, suggesting **UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION** by the server.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-400 as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description indicating processing delays due to undisclosed requests. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section highlights \"impact: processing delays to iControl REST requests\", suggesting that the server is experiencing **UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION**. The retriever results also ranked CWE-400 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-799 was considered because it relates to the frequency of interactions, which could be a contributing factor to the resource consumption. However, the description does not focus on rate limiting, so it was not selected as the primary CWE. The final decision to assign CWE-400 is based on the evidence of processing delays indicating a consumption of resources without proper control. CWE-400 is at the Class level of abstraction, but the lack of more specific information prevents selecting a more detailed Base or Variant CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive -
