CWE-367 also has a peer relationship with CWE-386 (Symbolic Name not Mapping to Correct Object). CWE-363 (Race Condition Enabling Link Following) is a child of CWE-367 and can precede CWE-59 (Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')). This chain of relationships helps clarify the specific nature of the TOCTOU vulnerability involving symlinks. CWE-59 is a base level weakness, describing the improper handling of links, which occurs as a result of the TOCTOU condition.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe59[\"CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\"]\n    cwe363[\"CWE-363: Race Condition Enabling Link Following\"]\n    cwe386[\"CWE-386: Symbolic Name not Mapping to Correct Object\"]\n    \n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    cwe363 -->|CHILDOF| cwe367\n    cwe363 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe59\n    cwe367 --|PEEROF| cwe386\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe367 primary\n    class cwe59 secondary\n    class cwe362,cwe363,cwe386 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **TOCTOU vulnerability** (CWE-367) where the software checks a file for malware. Before the action of deleting or quarantining the file is performed, the file is replaced with a symlink. The software then follows the symlink without proper validation (CWE-59), leading to actions on unintended files, potentially resulting in privilege escalation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description and key phrases, strongly indicates a Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly states \"A Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition exists.\" The vulnerability occurs because the software checks a file for malware, but before it can act on the file, it's replaced with a symlink. The software then improperly handles the symlink.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the connection between the TOCTOU condition (CWE-367) and the subsequent improper link resolution (CWE-59). This chain helps to pinpoint the root cause and the resulting weakness.\n\nCWE-367 is selected as the primary CWE because the root cause is a **Time of Check - Time of Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability**. CWE-59 is a secondary CWE because the TOCTOU condition leads to **improper link resolution**. Both CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity (Base level) as they directly represent the root cause and the resulting weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the file is a symbolic link that resolves to a target outside of the intended control sphere. This could allow an attacker to cause the product to operate on unauthorized files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n### Other CWEs Considered But Not Used:\n\n*   **CWE-61 UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following:** This is a compound CWE, and while the vulnerability involves symlinks, the root cause is the TOCTOU condition, making CWE-367 a better fit.\n*   **CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'):** While CWE-367 is a child of CWE-362, CWE-367 is more specific to the TOCTOU scenario.\n*   **CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write:** This CWE is not directly related to the described vulnerability. The issue is not about writing beyond buffer limits but about improper handling of symlinks due to a race condition.\n*   **CWE-1386 Insecure Operation on Windows Junction / Mount Point:** This is specific to Windows, and the description does not provide enough information to determine if Windows junctions or mount points are involved. While symlinks are used, it doesn't directly fit the description of junction/mount point abuse on Windows.\n*   **CWE-363 Race Condition Enabling Link Following:** While this CWE is related, it is less specific than CWE-367, which directly describes the TOCTOU condition.\n*   **CWE-131 Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size:** This CWE is not related to the described vulnerability, which involves race conditions and symlink handling.\n*   **CWE-459 Incomplete Cleanup:** This CWE is not directly related to the vulnerability. The issue is not about failing to clean up resources, but about improper handling of symlinks due to a race condition.\n*   **CWE-379 Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions:** This CWE is not directly related to the vulnerability. The issue is not about creating temporary files with insecure permissions, but about improper handling of symlinks due to a race condition.",
