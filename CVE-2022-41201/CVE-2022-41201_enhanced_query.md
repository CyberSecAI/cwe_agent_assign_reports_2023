# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-41201

# Vulnerability Description

    Due to **lack of proper memory management**, when a victim opens a manipulated Right Hemisphere Binary (.rh, rh.x3d) file received from untrusted sources in SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer - version 9, it is possible that a Remote Code Execution can be triggered when payload forces a **stack-based overflow** or a **re-use of dangling pointer** which refers to overwritten space in memory.
