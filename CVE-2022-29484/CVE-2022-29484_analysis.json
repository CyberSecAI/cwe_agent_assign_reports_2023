While it is discouraged by MITRE due to its high-level nature, the provided evidence points to a general authorization issue. CWE-285 is a parent of CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). The vulnerability involves bypassing operation restrictions, which falls under the umbrella of authorization issues. However, without further details on *how* the authorization is bypassed, choosing a more specific CWE is difficult.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **component operation restriction bypass** which leads to the ability to **delete the data of Space**. The chain can be summarized as:\n\n1.  **Improper Authorization (CWE-285):** The system fails to properly authorize the user's action.\n2.  **Data Deletion (Impact):** As a result of the failed authorization, the attacker can delete Space data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **weakness** as a **component operation restriction bypass**, leading to unauthorized data deletion. The CVE reference summary reinforces this by stating that \"The vulnerability is due to an operation restriction bypass\" and \"Operation restriction bypass (CWE-285)\".\n\nWhile CWE-285 is a high-level Class, the current level of detail does not enable us to select a more specific Base or Variant CWE. Therefore, despite the discouragement from MITRE, CWE-285 is the most fitting given the available information.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was considered, since it is a child of CWE-285, but the specific *incorrectness* of the authorization isn't clear. Therefore, I rated CWE-863 as a secondary candidate.\n\nThe selection is primarily based on the provided evidence, specifically the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section, which explicitly mentions \"Operation restriction bypass (CWE-285)\".\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
