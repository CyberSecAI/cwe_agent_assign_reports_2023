## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the selection was the parent-child relationship. CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is a variant of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), which in turn is a more specific instance of the class CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). The analysis starts with the most specific variant (CWE-122) due to clear evidence and then considers its broader implications using parent relationships.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **crafted web server request** that leads to a **heap-based buffer overflow**, ultimately causing a **denial of service**.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on the **weakness** as described in the Vulnerability Description Key Phrases and the more detailed Root Cause analysis in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. Both the phrase "**heap-based buffer overflow**" and the Root Cause description of writing past buffer boundaries in the heap directly support the selection of CWE-122.

The Retriever Results listed CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) as the top combined result. However, CWE-119 is a Class-level CWE and its mapping is discouraged when more specific CWEs are available. The next most relevant CWE was CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) which wasn't relevant in the rootcause. CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) was also listed and given that the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary mentioned "**heap-based buffer overflow**", this was selected as the primary CWE.

CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) was also considered because CWE-122 is a child of CWE-787.

The final decision to use CWE-122 is strongly supported by the vulnerability description and the evidence from the CVE reference links. The abstraction level is optimal because it is a Variant, which is more specific than a Class or Pillar.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-34583

## Vulnerability Description
Crafted web server requests may cause a **heap-based buffer overflow** and could therefore trigger a denial-of- service condition due to a crash in the CODESYS V2 web server prior to V1.1.9.22.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap-based buffer overflow**
- **impact:** denial of service
- **vector:** crafted web server requests
- **product:** CODESYS V2 web server
- **version:** prior to V1.1.9.22

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2021-34583:

**Vulnerability 1: Buffer Overflow**

*   **Root Cause:** A buffer overflow occurs when the CODESYS V2 web server copies data from a 0x100-byte stack-based buffer to a heap-based communication buffer. The size of the copy operation is controlled by the attacker.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Lack of proper bounds checking on the attacker-controlled copy size.
    *   Usage of `memcpy` without validating the size argument.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A large copy size can cause a buffer over-read on the stack or a buffer over-write on the heap which can crash the web server or the CODESYS Control runtime system.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** When configured with an external CODESYS Control runtime, a large copy size can leak stack contents over the network.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the CODESYS V2 web server with a specific message structure, including an oversized `copy_size`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can send the crafted HTTP request.

**Vulnerability 2: Heap-based Buffer Over-read/Over-write**

*   **Root Cause:** The CODESYS V2 web server performs an in-place XOR-based encoding of user-supplied data. The length of the data to be encoded is controlled by the attacker and can exceed the actual size of the input data.
*  **Weaknesses:**
    *   Missing validation of the attacker controlled encode length.
    *   In-place XOR encoding with insufficient bounds checking, leading to out-of-bounds read/write.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Heap corruption due to out-of-bounds write can crash the web server or the CODESYS Control runtime system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request with a specific message structure containing a base64 encoded string to be decoded and an overly large encode length.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can send the crafted HTTP request.

**Vulnerability 3: Message |9 NULL Pointer Dereference**

*   **Root Cause:** A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the web server processes a malformed message starting with '|9'. The web server does not check the return value of `strchr` which may lead to a NULL pointer.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Missing NULL check on the returned pointer from `strchr`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The NULL pointer dereference can crash the web server or the CODESYS Control runtime system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the CODESYS V2 web server with a specific message structure starting with "|9".
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can send the crafted HTTP request.

**Vulnerability 4: Message |10 NULL Pointer Dereference**

*   **Root Cause:** A NULL pointer dereference can occur when the web server processes a malformed message starting with '|10'. Similar to the previous vulnerability, the web server does not check the result of `strchr`.
*  **Weaknesses:**
    * Missing NULL check on the returned pointer from `strchr`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The NULL pointer dereference can crash the web server or the CODESYS Control runtime system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the CODESYS V2 web server with a specific message structure starting with "|10".
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can send the crafted HTTP request.

**Vulnerability 5: Message |b or |e NULL Pointer Dereference**

*   **Root Cause:** A NULL pointer dereference can occur when the web server processes a malformed message starting with '|b' or '|e'. Like before, the return value of `strchr` is not validated.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Missing NULL check on the returned pointer from `strchr`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The NULL pointer dereference crashes the web server or the CODESYS Control runtime system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the CODESYS V2 web server with a specific message structure starting with "|b" or "|e".
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can send the crafted HTTP request.

**Vulnerability 6: Message Parsing State 4 NULL Pointer Dereference**

*  **Root Cause:** A NULL pointer dereference can occur when the web server processes a malformed message in parsing state 4, specifically when the `psHexNum` pointer is not initialized.
*   **Weaknesses:**
     *   Missing validation that the pointer `psHexNum` is not NULL.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The NULL pointer dereference crashes the web server or the CODESYS Control runtime system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the CODESYS V2 web server with a message that triggers the parsing state 4 and causes the `psHexNum` pointer to remain NULL.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can send the crafted HTTP request.

**Vulnerability 7: Message |6 Invalid Memory Access DoS**

*   **Root Cause:** A memory read access violation occurs when the web server processes a message starting with '|6', due to unchecked return value of `strchr` and path traversal.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Missing NULL check on the returned pointer from `strchr`.
    *   Path traversal vulnerability via file extension field.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Memory access violation due to the NULL pointer dereference can crash the web server or the CODESYS Control runtime system. Arbitrary file read when combined with path traversal.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Path Traversal: Sending a crafted HTTP request to the CODESYS V2 web server with a specific message structure that includes a path traversal sequence in the file extension field, causing it to read arbitrary files.
    *   Uploaded File: Uploading a file with message type 3 and then force the server to process the file content with a message of type 6.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can send the crafted HTTP request.

The provided content also includes mitigation recommendations, such as applying the provided software updates, activating user management on the CODESYS V2.3 WebVisu, using firewalls, VPN, and other general security practices.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-118
ChildOf -> CWE-20

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist




## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Overflow: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
Wraparound: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
wrap, wrap-around, wrap around: Alternate spellings of "wraparound"

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-20
CanPrecede -> CWE-119

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with "overflow," "underflow," and "wraparound" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called "underflows").


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.

**[Terminology]** 

"Integer overflow" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.


A "wraparound" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.


"Overflow" is sometimes conflated with "wraparound" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.


The "overflow" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use "overflow" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using "underflow" for exceeding the minimum.


Some people use "overflow" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses "underflow" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.


See [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.


**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.




## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-788
ChildOf -> CWE-787

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Heap-based buffer overflows are usually just as dangerous as stack-based buffer overflows.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268:** Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).




## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.

### Extended Description
This typically occurs when the pointer or its index is incremented to a position beyond the bounds of the buffer or when pointer arithmetic results in a position outside of the valid memory location to name a few. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-125
ChildOf -> CWE-788

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** These problems may be resultant from missing sentinel values (CWE-463) or trusting a user-influenced input length variable.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-1733:** Text editor has out-of-bounds read past end of line while indenting C code
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated, leading to buffer over-read or heap-based buffer overflow.




## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Overflow: "Stack Overflow" is often used to mean the same thing as stack-based buffer overflow, however it is also used on occasion to mean stack exhaustion, usually a result from an excessively recursive function call. Due to the ambiguity of the term, use of stack overflow to describe either circumstance is discouraged.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-788
ChildOf -> CWE-787

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Stack-based buffer overflows can instantiate in return address overwrites, stack pointer overwrites or frame pointer overwrites. They can also be considered function pointer overwrites, array indexer overwrites or write-what-where condition, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-35395:** Stack-based buffer overflows in SFK for wifi chipset used for IoT/embedded devices, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.

### Extended Description
This is often triggered by improper handling of malformed data or unexpectedly interrupted sessions. In some languages, developers are responsible for tracking memory allocation and releasing the memory. If there are no more pointers or references to the memory, then it can no longer be tracked and identified for release.

### Alternative Terms
Memory Leak

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-772
ChildOf -> CWE-404
ChildOf -> CWE-404

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is often a resultant weakness due to improper handling of malformed data or early termination of sessions.

**[Terminology]** "memory leak" has sometimes been used to describe other kinds of issues, e.g. for information leaks in which the contents of memory are inadvertently leaked (CVE-2003-0400 is one such example of this terminology conflict).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-3119:** Memory leak because function does not free() an element of a data structure.
- **CVE-2004-0427:** Memory leak when counter variable is not decremented.
- **CVE-2002-0574:** chain: reference count is not decremented, leading to memory leak in OS by sending ICMP packets.




## CWE-128: Wrap-around Error
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Wrap around errors occur whenever a value is incremented past the maximum value for its type and therefore "wraps around" to a very small, negative, or undefined value.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-682
CanPrecede -> CWE-119
PeerOf -> CWE-190

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** The relationship between overflow and wrap-around needs to be examined more closely, since several entries (including CWE-190) are closely related.






## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
off-by-five: An "off-by-five" error was reported for sudo in 2002 (CVE-2002-0184), but that is more like a "length calculation" error.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-682
CanPrecede -> CWE-617
CanPrecede -> CWE-170
CanPrecede -> CWE-119

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is not always a buffer overflow. For example, an off-by-one error could be a factor in a partial comparison, a read from the wrong memory location, an incorrect conditional, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2003-0252:** Off-by-one error allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via requests that do not contain newlines.
- **CVE-2001-1391:** Off-by-one vulnerability in driver allows users to modify kernel memory.
- **CVE-2002-0083:** Off-by-one error allows local users or remote malicious servers to gain privileges.




## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
OOB read: Shorthand for "Out of bounds" read

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-119
ChildOf -> CWE-119
ChildOf -> CWE-119
ChildOf -> CWE-119

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1018:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to read 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2020-11899:** Out-of-bounds read in IP stack used in embedded systems, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.




## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-20
ChildOf -> CWE-20
CanPrecede -> CWE-789

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2008-1440:** lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop
- **CVE-2008-2374:** lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read
