CWE-805 is a `Base` level CWE, which is preferred. CWE-805 is a `ChildOf` CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-1284 also has a `ChildOf` CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation). There is a chain relationship where CWE-1284 can precede CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) .\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe805[\"CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    \n    cwe805 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe1284 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe789\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe805 primary\n    class cwe1284 secondary\n    class cwe119,cwe20,cwe789 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value** (CWE-805) due to **lack of input validation for size parameters from TA in TEE OS functions**, leading to out-of-bounds memory access. This ultimately results in a Denial of Service (DoS). A more complete chain would include **Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input** (CWE-1284) which could have prevented the **Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value** (CWE-805) and lead to a DoS.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value** in the `TEE_CipherUpdate` function. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions this weakness. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the **root cause** is due to a **lack of input validation for size parameters from TA in TEE OS functions**. This lack of validation allows an attacker to trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) by providing an excessively large `srcLen` value.\n\nThe graph relationships helped to refine the selection of CWE-805 as the primary CWE, as it is a direct consequence of the **Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value**. CWE-1284 was considered as a possible cause and included as a secondary CWE as that weakness could have prevented CWE-805.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they accurately represent the **root cause** and contributing factors of the vulnerability. CWE-805 directly describes the **Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value**, while CWE-1284 highlights the **improper validation** of input.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6156.56\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
