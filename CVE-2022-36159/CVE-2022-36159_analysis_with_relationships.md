| CWE-916 | Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-259, which is a variant of CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials). CWE-259 is more specific because the vulnerability explicitly involves a hard-coded password, not just any credential. The password also has a weak hash which makes password cracking easier. This leads to the inclusion of CWE-916, Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort, as a secondary weakness because the weak hash makes the password easily cracked.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with the **hard-coded password**, specifically the **hard-coded hash password for root** which is a **weak password strength**. This **weakness** allows a malicious actor to crack the password, gain access to the Wireless LAN Manager interface, open the telnet port, and then sniff traffic or inject malware.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified CWE-259 as the primary weakness due to the **hard-coded password**. Further analysis revealed that the password's hash was also weak, contributing to the ease of exploitation. This led to the inclusion of CWE-916 as a secondary weakness, representing the **insufficient computational effort** required to crack the password.

The selection of CWE-259 is strongly supported by the vulnerability description, particularly the phrase "**hard coded hash password for root**". This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-259, which focuses on hard-coded passwords. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" also confirms that the devices ship with a default `root` password hash that is the same across all devices.

The graph relationships helped clarify the connection between CWE-259 and its parent, CWE-798. While CWE-798 is a broader category encompassing various hard-coded credentials, CWE-259 is more specific to passwords, making it a more accurate representation of the vulnerability.

CWE-259 and CWE-916 are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root causes of the vulnerability: the existence of a hard-coded password and the weakness of its hash. These CWEs provide a clear and concise representation of the security flaw and its potential impact.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

This was considered, but CWE-259 is more specific because it focuses on hard-coded passwords rather than just weak credentials.

## CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

This was not selected because the vulnerability is not about the initialization of a resource, but rather the use of a hard-coded password.

## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

This was considered, but CWE-259 is a more specific variant of this CWE.

## CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses default credentials (such as passwords or cryptographic keys) for potentially critical functionality.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

This was not selected because the vulnerability is about a hard-coded password, not a default password.

## CWE-1393: Use of Default Password
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses default passwords for potentially critical functionality.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

This was not selected because the vulnerability is about a hard-coded password, not a default password.

## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

This CWE is related to CWE-916 because CWE-916 is a child of CWE-328

## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

This was not selected because the vulnerability is not directly related to the use of insufficiently random values.

## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

This was selected as a secondary weakness because the **weak password strength** allows the password to be cracked in few minutes.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

This was not selected because the vulnerability is not about reliance on unt
