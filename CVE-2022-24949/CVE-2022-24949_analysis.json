CWE-362 is a class-level CWE, while CWE-120 and CWE-131 are base-level CWEs, providing a more specific description of the underlying issue. CWE-131 CanPrecede CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) which is a parent of CWE-120.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\"]\n    cwe131[\"CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\"]\n\n    cwe120 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe362\n    cwe131 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe120\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe120,cwe131 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition** (CWE-362) that allows an attacker to influence the calculation of a buffer size (**logic bug**), which is incorrectly calculated (CWE-131), leading to a **buffer overflow** (CWE-120). This buffer overflow then leads to **privilege escalation to root**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates a privilege escalation issue caused by a combination of a **race condition**, **buffer overflow**, and **logic bug**. The **race condition** is the primary driver, allowing for exploitation of the other weaknesses. The **buffer overflow** results from a flaw in the buffer size calculation (**logic bug**), making CWE-131 and CWE-120 secondary to the primary **race condition**.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"A privilege escalation to root exists in Eternal Terminal prior to version 6.2.0. This is due to the combination of a **race condition**, **buffer overflow**, and **logic bug** all in PipeSocketHandlerlisten().\"\n\nCWE-362 accurately reflects the **race condition**, while CWE-120 captures the **buffer overflow** aspect, and CWE-131 describes the **incorrect calculation of buffer size**. These CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, providing a detailed understanding of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
