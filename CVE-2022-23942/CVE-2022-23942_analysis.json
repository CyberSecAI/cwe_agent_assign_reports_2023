CWE-1204 is a child of CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values), and relates to the weakness of the IV.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe1204[\"CWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe330[\"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\"]\n\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe1204 -->|CHILDOF| cwe330\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe321 primary\n    class cwe1204 secondary\n    class cwe798,cwe330 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the use of **hardcoded cryptographic keys** (CWE-321) and potentially a **weak initialization vector** (CWE-1204), which leads to **information disclosure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-321 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of a **hardcoded key**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the root cause is the use of a static, **hardcoded key** within the `EncryptUtil` class. It also identifies the possibility of a **hardcoded IV**, making CWE-1204 a secondary candidate.\n\nThe final conclusion is based on the provided evidence, which strongly supports the selection of CWE-321 as the primary weakness and provides some evidence for CWE-1204 as a secondary weakness. The selection is based on the root cause identified in the vulnerability description and the supporting information from the CVE reference.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-321 being a Variant and CWE-1204 being a Base.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a cryptographic primitive that uses an Initialization\n\t\t\tVector (IV), but the product does not generate IVs that are\n\t\t\tsufficiently unpredictable or unique according to the expected\n\t\t\tcryptographic requirements for that primitive.\n\t\t\t\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
