However, it's a Pillar level CWE, so a more specific CWE should be considered. |\n| CWE-639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | While access control is broken, the user controlled key is not mentioned or implied in the **Vulnerability Description**, so this is less likely to be the cause |\n| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.5 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | The **Vulnerability Description** does not specify what part of the Authorization is broken, so this is less likely to be the cause |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship considered was the parent-child relationship between CWE-284 and its potential children. While CWE-284 is a direct match based on the description, it is a Pillar-level CWE and therefore discouraged. The analysis considered more specific children like CWE-639 and CWE-863, but there wasn't enough evidence to confidently assign them.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe639,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is that there is **broken access control** in Password List entry elements in Devolutions Server before 2020.3. Further analysis is needed to identify the root cause of **broken access control** and the exploitability of the vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on finding a CWE that matched the \"**broken access control**\" description. CWE-284 is a direct match, but it's a high-level Pillar, which is discouraged. The retriever results provided several other potential CWEs, but none were a clear match based on the provided information.\n\nThe decision to assign CWE-284 is based on the explicit mention of \"**broken access control**\" in the **Vulnerability Description**. However, due to the high-level nature of CWE-284, the confidence is not high. Without further information about the root cause of the **broken access control**, it's difficult to select a more specific CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
