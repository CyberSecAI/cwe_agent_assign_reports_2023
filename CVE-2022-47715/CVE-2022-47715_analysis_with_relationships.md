# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2022-47715

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-614 | Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-614, is a Variant of CWE-319, Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information. The vulnerability description clearly indicates that the `Secure` attribute is missing from the cookie, leading to its transmission over unencrypted traffic. This aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-614. Selecting the more specific Variant CWE-614 provides a more accurate and granular classification of the vulnerability than its parent.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of the `Secure` flag** on the `LastYardVersion` cookie. This **weakness** allows the cookie to be transmitted over unencrypted HTTP connections, leading to the impact of an attacker being able to steal the cookie via unencrypted traffic. The root cause is the missing `Secure` attribute on the cookie, and the impact is the potential interception and unauthorized use of the cookie.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis strongly supports CWE-614 as the primary CWE. The vulnerability description and CVE reference links clearly state that the cookie is transmitted over unencrypted traffic due to the missing `Secure` attribute. The Retriever Results also list CWE-614 as the top candidate.

The evidence from the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" states:
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `LastYardVersion` cookie is missing the `Secure` flag.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The absence of the `Secure` flag on the `LastYardVersion` cookie allows it to be transmitted over unencrypted HTTP connections.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could intercept the `LastYardVersion` cookie when transmitted over unencrypted channels, potentially leading to unauthorized access or session hijacking.

Based on the evidence and relationship analysis, CWE-614 is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability. While CWE-319 is a parent, it's less specific.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions is not set, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-319

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2004-0462:** A product does not set the Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session with the product.
- **CVE-2008-3663:** A product does not set the secure flag for the session cookie in an https session, which can cause the cookie to be sent in http requests and make it easier for remote attackers to capture this cookie.
- **CVE-2008-3662:** A product does not set the secure flag for the session cookie in an https session, which can cause the cookie to be sent in http requests and make it easier for remote attackers to capture this cookie.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description
Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.

Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.

When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to "sniff" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-311
ChildOf -> CWE-311

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29519:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends sensitive information in plaintext, including passwords and session tokens.
- **CVE-2022-30312:** Building Controller uses a protocol that transmits authentication credentials in plaintext.
- **CVE-2022-31204:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends password in plaintext.

CWE-113, CWE-312, and CWE-522 were considered but deemed less relevant. CWE-113 involves CRLF injection, which is not part of this vulnerability. CWE-312 refers to the storage of sensitive information in cleartext, while this vulnerability concerns transmission. CWE-522 is broader, covering insufficient protection of credentials, whereas CWE-614 focuses specifically on the missing `Secure` attribute for cookies.
