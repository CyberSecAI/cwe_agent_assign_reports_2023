## Vulnerability Description
**Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine** in GitHub repository microweber/microweber prior to 1.3.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine**
- **product:** microweber/microweber
- **version:** prior to 1.3

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, the commit `e0224462b3dd6b1f7c6ec1197413afc6019bc3b5` in the `microweber/microweber` repository includes changes to the `AdminCommentController.php` file related to comment sanitization.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant changes:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The commit addresses a vulnerability related to insufficient sanitization of user-provided comment bodies before they are saved to the database. Specifically, the original code was not adequately preventing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **XSS Vulnerability:**  The original code had weaknesses in its XSS prevention mechanisms, potentially allowing malicious users to inject JavaScript code into comments.
-   **Inadequate Sanitization:** The original sanitization process was not sufficiently robust.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **XSS attacks:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code through comments. If a user views a comment with such code, it could lead to:
    -   Session hijacking: Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    -   Redirection: Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    -   Defacement: Modifying the website's appearance.
    -   Data theft: Exfiltrating sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Comment Submission:** An attacker would submit a comment containing malicious JavaScript code.
-   **Admin Panel:** The vulnerability is within the admin panel comment management.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   The attacker needs to be a user able to post comments.
-   The attacker would likely need access to submit a comment or post a comment in the admin panel.

**Detailed changes in the commit:**

-   **Removal of unnecessary HTML cleaning:** The lines removing HTML with `$comment_body = $this->app->format->clean_html($comment_body);` and `$cleanHtml = new HTMLClean(); $comment_body = $cleanHtml->onlyTags($comment_body);` were removed.
-   **Improved XSS cleaning:** The XSS cleaning was improved, with  `$evil` array containing patterns for removing dangerous HTML attributes and elements, such as attributes starting with 'on' followed by any character, 'xmlns', 'formaction', 'xlink:href', 'FSCommand', and 'seekSegmentTime'. `$comment\_body = $this->app->format->clean\_xss($comment\_body, true, $evil, 'removeEvilAttributes');` now utilizes this array for removal.

This commit attempts to fix the vulnerability by removing redundant cleaning operations and strengthening XSS sanitization by using a more robust list of patterns to remove potentially harmful attributes.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.

### Extended Description


Many web applications use template engines that allow developers to insert externally-influenced values into free text or messages in order to generate a full web page, document, message, etc. Such engines include Twig, Jinja2, Pug, Java Server Pages, FreeMarker, Velocity, ColdFusion, Smarty, and many others - including PHP itself. Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.


Template engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression "{{7*7}}" and determine if the output returns "49" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.


In some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.


Template engines can be used on the server or client, so both "sides" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.


### Alternative Terms
Server-Side Template Injection / SSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a server.
Client-Side Template Injection / CSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a client.

- **CVE-2021-42258:** SQL injection in time and billing software, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-27101:** SQL injection in file-transfer system via a crafted Host header, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

### Extended Description
Most languages and protocols have their own special elements such as characters and reserved words. These special elements can carry control implications. If product does not prevent external control or influence over the inclusion of such special elements, the control flow of the program may be altered from what was intended. For example, both Unix and Windows interpret the symbol < ("less than") as meaning "read input from a file".

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-707

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness can be related to interpretation conflicts or interaction errors in intermediaries (such as proxies or application firewalls) when the intermediary's model of an endpoint does not account for protocol-specific special elements.

**[Relationship]** See this entry's children for different types of special elements that have been observed at one point or another. However, it can be difficult to find suitable CVE examples. In an attempt to be complete, CWE includes some types that do not have any associated observed example.

**[Research Gap]** This weakness is probably under-studied for proprietary or custom formats. It is likely that these issues are fairly common in applications that use their own custom format for configuration files, logs, meta-data, messaging, etc. They would only be found by accident or with a focused effort based on an understanding of the format.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-0677:** Read arbitrary files from mail client by providing a special MIME header that is internally used to store pathnames for attachments.
- **CVE-2000-0703:** Setuid program does not cleanse special escape sequence before sending data to a mail program, causing the mail program to process those sequences.
- **CVE-2003-0020:** Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.




## CWE-162: Improper Neutralization of Trailing Special Elements
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes trailing special elements that could be interpreted in unexpected ways when they are sent to a downstream component.

### Extended Description
As data is parsed, improperly handled trailing special elements may cause the process to take unexpected actions that result in an attack.

- **CVE-2020-20739:** A variable that has its value set in a conditional statement is sometimes used when the conditional fails, sometimes causing data leakage




## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

### Extended Description
Software or other automated logic has certain assumptions about what constitutes data and control respectively. It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-707

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.
**Comments:** Examine the children and descendants of this entry to find a more precise mapping.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** Many people treat injection only as an input validation problem (CWE-20) because many people do not distinguish between the consequence/attack (injection) and the protection mechanism that prevents the attack from succeeding. However, input validation is only one potential protection mechanism (output encoding is another), and there is a chaining relationship between improper input validation and the improper enforcement of the structure of messages to other components. Other issues not directly related to input validation, such as race conditions, could similarly impact message structure.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-5184:** API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.
- **CVE-2022-36069:** Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.
- **CVE-1999-0067:** Canonical example of OS command injection. CGI program does not neutralize "|" metacharacter when invoking a phonebook program.




## CWE-156: Improper Neutralization of Whitespace
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as whitespace when they are sent to a downstream component.

### Extended Description
This can include space, tab, etc.

### Alternative Terms
White space

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-138

### Mapping Guidance
