It has a ChildOf relationship to CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code). CWE-79 is a peer of CWE-1336.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n\n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe1336 --|PEEROF| cwe79\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1336 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine** (CWE-1336), which leads to potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks (CWE-79) due to the insufficient sanitization of user-provided comment bodies.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-1336 as the primary weakness due to the **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine**. The vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly indicate that the root cause is related to the failure to properly neutralize special elements in a template engine, allowing for potential injection attacks. The provided evidence and graph relationships confirm the selection of CWE-1336 as the most appropriate and specific classification.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1336 is based on the following evidence:\n\n*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** explicitly mentions \"**Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine**\".\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** details the insufficient sanitization of user-provided comment bodies, leading to potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.\n*   **Retriever Results:** lists CWE-1336 as the top combined result.\n*   **Complete CWE Specifications:** CWE-1336 description aligns with the vulnerability details, specifically mentioning the use of template engines and the risk of injection attacks.\n\nThe vulnerability involves the product's failure to properly neutralize special elements within a template engine. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code, such as JavaScript, which can then be executed in the context of other users' sessions. The impact includes potential session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, website defacement, and data theft.\n\nCWE-79 was considered as a secondary weakness because the lack of sanitization leads to potential XSS attacks. However, CWE-1336 is more specific to the root cause, which involves the template engine.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-1336 is a Base-level CWE that directly addresses the improper neutralization within the template engine.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-162: Improper Neutralization of Trailing Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes trailing special elements that could be interpreted in unexpected ways when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
