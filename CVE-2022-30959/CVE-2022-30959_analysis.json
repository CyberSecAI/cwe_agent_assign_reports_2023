It has child relationships to CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is a class-level weakness and has child relationships to CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication), CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), and CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere). The relationship analysis shows a clear link between missing authorization and the potential for exposing credentials if access is not properly controlled.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|ChildOf| cwe284\n    cwe522 -->|ChildOf| cwe1390\n    cwe522 -->|ChildOf| cwe287\n    cwe522 -->|ChildOf| cwe668\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284,cwe1390,cwe287,cwe668 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing permission check** (CWE-862). This allows an attacker with Overall/Read permissions to connect to an attacker-specified SSH server using attacker-specified credentials IDs, leading to the capture of credentials stored in Jenkins. The exposure of these credentials can be seen as **insufficiently protected credentials** (CWE-522), especially if they are stored or transmitted in a vulnerable manner.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identified CWE-862 as the primary weakness due to the **missing permission check**. The vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary both strongly support this. The retriever results also list CWE-862 as the top combined result.\n\nThe analysis also considered other CWEs such as CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials). While the initial **missing permission check** is the root cause, the impact involves the exposure of credentials. Therefore, CWE-522 is included as a secondary CWE to represent the potential consequence of the **missing authorization**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 and CWE-522 is based on the provided evidence and the CWE specifications. CWE-862 is a Class-level CWE, and while a more specific Base or Variant CWE might exist, the current information doesn't provide enough detail to determine that. The CWE specifications and mapping guidance were consulted for both CWEs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
