While the description suggests more specific weaknesses, the available information points to a general issue of the server not properly controlling resource allocation, leading to resource exhaustion.\n\nCWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is a child of CWE-400 and represents a more specific scenario where resources are allocated without proper limits. This is potentially relevant, as the vulnerability involves improper cleanup of connections and associated resources, effectively allocating resources without limit.\n\nCWE-755 (Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions) is also considered, given that the **bug in error handling** is the root cause, leading to improper cleanup. However, this is a class-level CWE and is less specific than CWE-400 or CWE-770.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe755[\"CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe755 -->|PARENT| cwe703\n    cwe755 -->|CHILDOF| cwe703\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n    class cwe755 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **bug in error handling** of invalid HTTP/2 requests, which leads to improper resource cleanup. This results in uncontrolled resource consumption, ultimately causing a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nBug in Error Handling -> Improper Resource Cleanup -> Uncontrolled Resource Consumption -> Denial of Service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and impact of the vulnerability. The **bug in error handling** and resulting Denial of Service are key indicators. The description explicitly states that the server encounters an invalid HTTP/2 request, and the error handling fails to properly clean up active connections and associated resources.\n\nThe selection of CWE-400 as the primary CWE is based on the overall impact of uncontrolled resource consumption. The evidence states that \"**This can lead to a Denial of Service scenario where there are no enough resources left to process good requests**.\" This aligns with the description of CWE-400, which states, \"The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\"\n\nCWE-770 is a secondary consideration because the vulnerability involves allocating resources (connections, associated resources) without proper limits, due to the error handling **bug**.\n\nCWE-755 is also considered as a secondary CWE due to the **bug in error handling**. The vulnerability description explicitly indicates that the vulnerability lies within the error handling.\n\nThe graph relationships highlight the hierarchical structure, with CWE-770 being a child of CWE-400, indicating a more specific case of resource consumption.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity based on the provided evidence. While a more specific CWE might exist, the current description focuses on the general issue of uncontrolled resource consumption due to a **bug in error handling** and improper resource cleanup, without going into finer details about the exact mechanism of resource allocation or the specific type of resource being exhausted.",
