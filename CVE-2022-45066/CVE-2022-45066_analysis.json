While this is generally discouraged, the available evidence does not pinpoint a more specific Base or Variant CWE with high confidence. Several potential child CWEs of CWE-284 were considered, including CWE-639, CWE-425, and CWE-862. These relationships influenced the secondary CWE selections to provide additional context.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe639,cwe425,cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **broken access control** issue, leading to an unprivileged user being able to perform unauthorized actions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **broken access control** as the primary weakness. However, the evidence is not specific enough to pinpoint the exact mechanism of the access control failure. Therefore, CWE-284 was chosen as the primary CWE, acknowledging its high-level nature. Several other more specific CWEs were considered, particularly CWE-639, CWE-425, and CWE-862, and included as secondary mappings.\n\nThe vulnerability description key phrase \"rootcause: **broken access control**\" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary stating \"The vulnerability is due to a '**Broken Access Control**' issue, which means a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check\" support the assessment.\n\nThe selection of CWE-284 is at a higher level due to the lack of specific details. More information would be required to narrow down the root cause to a more precise CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.107\n\n### CWE-284: Improper Access Control\nCWE-284 (Improper Access Control) is selected as the primary CWE. The vulnerability description clearly indicates a **broken access control** issue. While CWE-284 is a high-level Pillar, the lack of specific details about the access control failure prevents a more precise mapping. The mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-284 due to its high level of abstraction, but in this case, the limited evidence justifies its selection. Confidence: 0.75\n\n### CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\nCWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) is included as a secondary CWE. This CWE is relevant if an attacker can modify a key value to access another user's data. Although there is no explicit evidence for this in the description, it is a common access control issue. Confidence: 0.7\n\n### CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\nCWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')) is included as a secondary CWE. This CWE is applicable if the application fails to enforce authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files. This is a plausible scenario given the **broken access control** issue. Confidence: 0.6\n\n### CWE-862: Missing Authorization\nCWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is included as a secondary CWE. This CWE applies when the product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. This is a direct manifestation of the **broken access control** issue. Confidence: 0.5\n\n### Other CWEs Considered and Not Used:\nCWE-1390 (Weak Authentication): This CWE was considered but not selected because the vulnerability description focuses on access control issues rather than authentication weaknesses.\nCWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)): This CWE was considered but not selected because there is no evidence to suggest that the vulnerability involves CSRF.\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization): This CWE was considered, however, due to the general nature of the description, it is unclear whether the authorization is missing (CWE-862) or incorrect (CWE-863). It could be either.\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization): This CWE was considered but deemed too high-level, similar to CWE-284, without providing any additional specificity.\nCWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function): Similar to CWE-1390, the focus is on access control, not missing authentication.\nCWE-1275 (Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute): This CWE is not relevant as it focuses on cookie-related issues, while the vulnerability is about general access control.",
