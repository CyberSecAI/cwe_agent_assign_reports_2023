CWE-341 is also a child of CWE-330. The relationship analysis indicates that the use of a **cryptographically weak PRNG** (CWE-338) is a specific instance of using insufficiently random values (CWE-330) and can lead to predictable states (CWE-341).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe338[\"CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\"]\n    cwe330[\"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\"]\n    cwe341[\"CWE-341: Predictable from Observable State\"]\n    \n    cwe338 -->|CHILDOF| cwe330\n    cwe341 -->|CHILDOF| cwe330\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe338 primary\n    class cwe330,cwe341 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of the cryptographically insecure `uniqid()` PHP function** (CWE-338), which leads to the generation of predictable session IDs (CWE-330, CWE-341), and culminates in the potential for an attacker to brute-force these session IDs and take over user accounts.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **use of a cryptographically weak PRNG** function, `uniqid()`, for generating session IDs, as stated in the vulnerability description: \"Vulnerability in the generation of session IDs in revive-adserver < 5.3.0, based on the **cryptographically insecure uniqid() PHP function**.\" This directly aligns with CWE-338. The CVE reference link content summary reinforces this by explicitly stating that the root cause is the use of `uniqid()`, and identifies CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) as a relevant weakness. Though CWE-327 was not in the Retriever results, CWE-338 is closely related and a better fit.\n\nCWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values) is a more general class that encompasses CWE-338. While technically applicable, CWE-338 provides a more precise characterization of the vulnerability. CWE-341 (Predictable from Observable State) is applicable, because the weakness in the PRNG leads to a predictable state.\n\nTherefore, CWE-338 is the most specific and appropriate choice as the primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
