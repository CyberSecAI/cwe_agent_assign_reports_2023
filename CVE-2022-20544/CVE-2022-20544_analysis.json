It's a class-level CWE with potential for more specific base-level children. CWE-862 is related to CWE-285 **Improper Authorization** through a ChildOf relationship, indicating that the **missing authorization** is a specific type of improper authorization.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe926[\"CWE-926: Improper Export of Android Application Components\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe926 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285, cwe926 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with the **missing permission check** (CWE-862), leading to a bypass of profile owner restrictions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, key phrases, and CVE reference content. The key evidence is the phrase \"**missing permission check**\", which directly aligns with the concept of **missing authorization**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is based on the following:\n*   The vulnerability description explicitly states a \"**missing permission check**\".\n*   The CVE reference summary indicates a \"**bypass of the DISALLOW_APPS_CONTROL restriction**\". This restriction is related to authorization.\n*   CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** directly addresses scenarios where authorization checks are absent.\n\nCWE-926 **Improper Export of Android Application Components** was considered since the vulnerability is in an Android application. However, the root cause isn't directly related to the component being exported, but rather the **missing permission check** when accessing the component's functionality. Therefore, it is a less suitable fit, although potentially a contributing factor.\n\nThe selected CWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity, given the provided information. While there might be more specific base-level children of CWE-862, the available evidence does not provide enough detail to pinpoint a more precise CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
