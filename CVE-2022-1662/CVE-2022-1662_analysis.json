There were no child or parent relationships that influenced the selection, as CWE-214 directly and accurately reflects the vulnerability's nature.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe214[\"CWE-214: Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe214 -->|CHILDOF| cwe497\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe214 primary\n    class cwe497 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper** handling of the Red Hat Subscription Manager user password by passing it as a command-line argument. This leads to the **exposure** of the password in the process list, which can then be viewed by unauthorized local users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which provide sufficient evidence to support the CWE mapping.\n\nThe core of the vulnerability lies in passing the Red Hat Subscription Manager user password via the CLI to convert2rhel, which is described in the \"Vulnerability Description\". This is further reinforced in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which states: \"An Ansible playbook (`ansible/run-convert2rhel.yml`) within the `convert2rhel` tool was passing the Red Hat Subscription Manager user password via the command-line interface (CLI) to the `convert2rhel` tool.\"\n\nThis **exposure** allows unauthorized local users to view the password via the process list while convert2rhel is running. This aligns directly with CWE-214 (Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information), which describes a scenario where a process is invoked with sensitive command-line arguments that can be seen by other processes on the operating system.\n\nCWE-214 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is appropriate for this vulnerability. It accurately captures the root cause of the issue, where sensitive information is exposed through command-line arguments. Other CWEs like CWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer) and CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) were considered but deemed less appropriate because they describe different scenarios, such as **improper** data removal or insertion of sensitive data into broader data streams, respectively. The vulnerability isn't about **improper** removal or general data insertion but specifically about passing sensitive information as a command-line argument.\n\nThe provided evidence and the characteristics of CWE-214 confirm that it's the most suitable classification for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-214: Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA process is invoked with sensitive command-line arguments, environment variables, or other elements that can be seen by other processes on the operating system.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
