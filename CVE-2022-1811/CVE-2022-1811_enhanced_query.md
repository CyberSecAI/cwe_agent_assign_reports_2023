### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **unrestricted upload of file with dangerous type**
- **product:** publify/publify
- **version:** prior to 9.2.9

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2022-1811:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the `ResourceUploader` in the Publify application handles file uploads. Specifically, it was possible to bypass the intended content type restrictions by declaring an HTML file as "text/plain".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **MIME Type Mismatch Bypass:** The application was vulnerable to a MIME type mismatch bypass. Even if the user declared the file as text/plain, the system was able to detect the real MIME type. However, due to a vulnerability, it was not properly enforcing it for non-image files.
*   **Inadequate Content Type Validation:** The initial implementation did not properly validate the content type of uploaded files, particularly non-image files which only got validated through `file_content_type(new_file)`. This allowed attackers to upload HTML files disguised as text/plain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Potential for Malicious HTML Injection:** By uploading an HTML file disguised as text/plain, an attacker could potentially inject malicious HTML content into the application.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability (Potential):**  If the application rendered the uploaded content without proper sanitization, this could lead to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** An attacker could upload a malicious HTML file through the resource upload functionality of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to File Upload Functionality:** The attacker needs to have access to the application's admin panel/functionality which allows uploading files.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious HTML:** The attacker must be capable of crafting a malicious HTML file.
*   **Understanding of MIME Type Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate file metadata to declare the malicious HTML as text/plain.

**Technical Details from the Commit:**

The commit `0fb6b027fbaf17f6a6551f2148482a03eac12927` addresses this vulnerability by:

*   **Adding a stricter `check_content_type!` method**: This method now checks the file's actual content type using `Marcel::MimeType.for` for all files, not just images.
*   **Adding a test case to prevent future regressions**: The test case checks if an html file, falsely identified as text/plain, is not uploaded.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the `resource_uploader.rb` file.
*   The fix involves modifying the `check_content_type!` method and adding `file_content_type(new_file)` for files that are not images. This ensures that the content type is detected based on the file content itself and not just the user-provided metadata.
*   The `resources_controller_spec.rb` file was updated with a test case to explicitly check that HTML files uploaded as text/plain are rejected, preventing regressions.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

This can have a chaining relationship with incomplete denylist / permissive allowlist errors when the product tries, but fails, to properly limit which types of files are allowed (CWE-183, CWE-184).


This can also overlap multiple interpretation errors for intermediaries, e.g. anti-virus products that do not remove or quarantine attachments with certain file extensions that can be processed by client systems.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-5227:** PHP-based FAQ management app does not check the MIME type for uploaded images
- **CVE-2001-0901:** Web-based mail product stores ".shtml" attachments that could contain SSI
- **CVE-2002-1841:** PHP upload does not restrict file types




## CWE-436: Interpretation Conflict
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Product A handles inputs or steps differently than Product B, which causes A to perform incorrect actions based on its perception of B's state.

### Extended Description
This is generally found in proxies, firewalls, anti-virus software, and other intermediary devices that monitor, allow, deny, or modify traffic based on how the client or server is expected to behave.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-435

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-1215:** Bypass filters or poison web cache using requests with multiple Content-Length headers, a non-standard behavior.
- **CVE-2002-0485:** Anti-virus product allows bypass via Content-Type and Content-Disposition headers that are mixed case, which are still processed by some clients.
- **CVE-2002-1978:** FTP clients sending a command with "PASV" in the argument can cause firewalls to misinterpret the server's error as a valid response, allowing filter bypass.




## CWE-25: Path Traversal: '/../filedir'
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize "/../" sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

### Extended Description


This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.


Sometimes a program checks for "../" at the beginning of the input, so a "/../" can bypass that check.


### Alternative Terms

## CWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product is composed of a server that relies on the client to implement a mechanism that is intended to protect the server.

### Extended Description
When the server relies on protection mechanisms placed on the client side, an attacker can modify the client-side behavior to bypass the protection mechanisms, resulting in potentially unexpected interactions between the client and server. The consequences will vary, depending on what the mechanisms are trying to protect.

### Alternative Terms
None

- **CVE-2007-0163:** steganography products embed password information in the carrier file, which can be extracted from a modified client.




## CWE-646: Reliance on File Name or Extension of Externally-Supplied File
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product allows a file to be uploaded, but it relies on the file name or extension of the file to determine the appropriate behaviors. This could be used by attackers to cause the file to be misclassified and processed in a dangerous fashion.

### Extended Description
An application might use the file name or extension of a user-supplied file to determine the proper course of action, such as selecting the correct process to which control should be passed, deciding what data should be made available, or what resources should be allocated. If the attacker can cause the code to misclassify the supplied file, then the wrong action could occur. For example, an attacker could supply a file that ends in a ".php.gif" extension that appears to be a GIF image, but would be processed as PHP code. In extreme cases, code execution is possible, but the attacker could also cause exhaustion of resources, denial of service, exposure of debug or system data (including application source code), or being bound to a particular server side process. This weakness may be due to a vulnerability in any of the technologies used by the web and application servers, due to misconfiguration, or resultant from another flaw in the application itself.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-345

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**

## CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly protect an assumed-immutable element from being modified by an attacker.

### Extended Description
This occurs when a particular input is critical enough to the functioning of the application that it should not be modifiable at all, but it is. Certain resources are often assumed to be immutable when they are not, such as hidden form fields in web applications, cookies, and reverse DNS lookups.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-664

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** MAID issues can be primary to many other weaknesses, and they are a major factor in languages that provide easy access to internal program constructs, such as PHP's register_globals and similar features. However, MAID issues can also be resultant from weaknesses that modify internal state; for example, a program might validate some data and store it in memory, but a buffer overflow could overwrite that validated data, leading to a change in program logic.

**[Theoretical]** There are many examples where the MUTABILITY property is a major factor in a vulnerability.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-1757:** Relies on $PHP_SELF variable for authentication.
- **CVE-2005-1905:** Gain privileges by modifying assumed-immutable code addresses that are accessed by a driver.




## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

### Extended Description
This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.

### Alternative Terms
Zip Slip: "Zip slip" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282]. It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)
- **CVE-2019-20916:** Python package manager does not correctly restrict the filename specified in a Content-Disposition header, allowing arbitrary file read using path traversal sequences such as "../"




## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

### Extended Description


Attackers can sometimes bypass input validation schemes by finding inputs that appear to be safe, but will be dangerous when processed at a lower layer or by a downstream component. For example, a simple XSS protection mechanism might try to validate that an input has no "<script>" tags using case-sensitive matching, but since HTML is case-insensitive when processed by web browsers, an attacker could inject "<ScrIpT>" and trigger XSS.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2020-11053:** Chain: Go-based Oauth2 reverse proxy can send the authenticated user to another site at the end of the authentication flow. A redirect URL with HTML-encoded whitespace characters can bypass the validation (CWE-1289) to redirect to a malicious site (CWE-601)
- **CVE-2005-0269:** File extension check in forum software only verifies extensions that contain all lowercase letters, which allows remote attackers to upload arbitrary files via file extensions that include uppercase letters.




## CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product provides an Applications Programming Interface (API) or similar interface for interaction with external actors, but the interface includes a dangerous method or function that is not properly restricted.

### Extended Description


This weakness can lead to a wide variety of resultant weaknesses, depending on the behavior of the exposed method. It can apply to any number of technologies and approaches, such as ActiveX controls, Java functions, IOCTLs, and so on.


The exposure can occur in a few different ways:


  - The function/method was never intended to be exposed to outside actors.

  - The function/method was only intended to be accessible to a limited set of actors, such as Internet-based access from a single web site.



### Alternative Terms
None

### Additional Notes
**[Research Gap]** Under-reported and under-studied. This weakness could appear in any technology, language, or framework that allows the programmer to provide a functional interface to external parties, but it is not heavily reported. In 2007, CVE began showing a notable increase in reports of exposed method vulnerabilities in ActiveX applications, as well as IOCTL access to OS-level resources. These weaknesses have been documented for Java applications in various secure programming sources, but there are few reports in CVE, which suggests limited awareness in most parts of the vulnerability research community.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2007-6382:** arbitrary Java code execution via exposed method
- **CVE-2007-1112:** security tool ActiveX control allows download or upload of files
