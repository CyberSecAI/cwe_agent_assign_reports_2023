# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2022-27182

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-770 | Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-770, which is a Base level CWE and a child of CWE-400. CWE-400 is a Class level CWE that represents a more general case of uncontrolled resource consumption. The relationship between these CWEs is hierarchical, with CWE-770 being a more specific type of CWE-400. Therefore, CWE-770 is a more appropriate choice.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is as follows:
1.  Undisclosed requests are sent to the BIG-IP system.
2.  The system allocates memory resources for these requests **without limits or throttling** (CWE-770).
3.  The memory resource utilization increases, leading to potential resource exhaustion (CWE-400), which is the impact.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly states that undisclosed requests can cause an increase in memory resource utilization when BIG-IP packet filters are enabled. This indicates that the system is allocating resources without proper limits or throttling.

The primary CWE selected is **CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling)**, which aligns with the root cause of the vulnerability. The description of CWE-770 states, "The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor." This perfectly matches the vulnerability description, where the BIG-IP system allocates memory resources without limits, leading to increased resource utilization.

The **impact** of this vulnerability is **uncontrolled resource consumption**, which is represented by CWE-400. However, CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE and is discouraged for use when more specific CWEs are available. The retriever results also suggest considering CWE-770 as an alternative to CWE-400.

The evidence from the vulnerability description supports the selection of CWE-770 as the primary CWE with high confidence. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-770 is a more specific and appropriate choice than its parent, CWE-400. The mapping guidance allows the use of CWE-770, as it is a Base-level CWE.

Other CWEs Considered:

*   CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption - This was considered but not selected as the primary CWE because it represents the impact of the vulnerability rather than the root cause. Also, CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400 and a more specific representation of the vulnerability.
*   CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value - While memory allocation is involved, the core issue is the lack of limits, not necessarily the size of each allocation.
*   CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool - This is related, but the main issue is the allocation without limits, not the size of the pool itself.
*   CWE-20: Improper Input Validation - Input validation may be a contributing factor, but the primary weakness is the lack of resource management.
*   CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input - Similar to CWE-20, this might be a contributing factor, but the main problem is not directly related to the validation of quantities.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is "asymmetric."

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

## CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product's resource pool is not large enough to handle peak demand, which allows an attacker to prevent others from accessing the resource by using a (relatively) large number of requests for resources.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
