While CWE-311 is the more direct match to the vulnerability description, it's a Class-level CWE. CWE-312, a child of CWE-311, is a Base-level CWE and provides a more specific description of the vulnerability, indicating the sensitive information is stored in cleartext. Therefore, both are considered with CWE-311 as the primary due to directness of the match in the description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe311 primary\n    class cwe312 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing encryption of sensitive data**, which leads to the impact of an attacker with physical access being able to obtain the stored passwords.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data)** as the primary candidate due to the direct mention of \"missing encryption of sensitive data\" in the vulnerability description. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" further validates this by stating, \"The core weakness is the lack of encryption for passwords stored on the devices.\"\n\nUpon further review, **CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information)** was considered as a secondary candidate because the vulnerability description mentions that the attacker can \"obtain the stored passwords,\" implying that the data is stored in an unencrypted format. CWE-312 is a child of CWE-311 and is more specific, representing the storage aspect of the vulnerability.\n\nThe final decision is to map both CWEs. CWE-311 is the primary because the description explicitly mentions **missing encryption**, but CWE-312 adds the detail that the sensitive data is stored in **cleartext**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product violates well-established principles for secure design.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
