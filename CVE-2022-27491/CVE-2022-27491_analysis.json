While not explicitly in a parent-child relationship with **CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling)**, the impact of the improper verification leads to resource exhaustion, making it a potential following weakness in a chain. The abstraction levels are both Base, making them suitable for direct mapping.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe940[\"CWE-940: Improper Verification of Source of a Communication Channel\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    \n    cwe940 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe770\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe940 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper verification of the source of a communication channel (CWE-940)**. This allows a remote attacker to send crafted TCP requests, which in turn triggers the FortiOS device to send blocked page HTML data to an arbitrary victim. The flooding of the victim with this data results in a denial-of-service, indicating a possible **allocation of resources without limits or throttling (CWE-770)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identifies the root cause as an **improper verification of source of communication channel (CWE-940)**. This is based on the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" that indicates **improper verification of source of a communication channel** is the rootcause, and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" that states \"The vulnerability stems from an improper verification of the source of a communication channel within FortiOS. This allows an attacker to manipulate TCP requests.\". The retriever results also list **CWE-940** as the top candidate with the highest score.\n\nThe secondary analysis considers the impact of the vulnerability. The vulnerability allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to trigger the sending of blocked page HTML data to an arbitrary victim via crafted TCP requests, potentially flooding the victim, indicating a possible **allocation of resources without limits or throttling (CWE-770)**.\n\n**CWE-940 (Improper Verification of Source of a Communication Channel)** is selected as the primary CWE because it directly reflects the **root cause** described in the vulnerability report.\n**CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling)** is considered as a secondary weakness due to the impact of the vulnerability that leads to DoS.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Rationale for not selecting:* The vulnerability doesn't focus on input that is compared to unsafe values.
