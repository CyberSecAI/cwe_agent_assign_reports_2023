The description explicitly mentions \"Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\" |\n| CWE-915 | Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. It is a child of CWE-913 and a more specific case.|\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the ChildOf relationship between CWE-913 and CWE-915. CWE-913 is a Class-level CWE, while CWE-915 is a Base-level CWE, representing a more specific instance of the broader class. Since the description mentions \"Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources,\" CWE-913 is a good starting point. Further analysis led to considering CWE-915 as a more specific possibility, representing improper modification of dynamically-determined object attributes.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\"]\n    cwe915[\"CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes\"]\n    cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\"]\n\n    cwe913 -- CHILDOF --> cwe664\n    cwe915 -- CHILDOF --> cwe913\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe913 primary\n    class cwe915 secondary\n    class cwe664 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources** (CWE-913) which can lead to **Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes** (CWE-915). The final impact is not explicitly mentioned in the description but could lead to various issues depending on the attributes being modified.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment was based on the vulnerability description mentioning \"**Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources**\". This directly corresponds to CWE-913.\n\nThe relationship analysis then focused on finding a more specific CWE. CWE-915, \"Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes,\" is a child of CWE-913 and represents a more specific scenario.\n\nThe final decision is to classify the vulnerability as CWE-913, with CWE-915 as a secondary candidate that provides a more granular perspective on the weakness. This decision is based on both the direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the hierarchical relationship between the CWEs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
