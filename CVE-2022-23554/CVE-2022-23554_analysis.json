CWE-289 is a base CWE and a child of CWE-1390. CWE-863 is a class CWE and parent to CWE-639. CWE-287 is a class CWE that is discouraged because more specific CWEs exist. The vulnerability uses a partial string comparison which leads to an authentication bypass. The most specific and accurate CWE is CWE-187.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe187[\"CWE-187: Partial String Comparison\"]\n    cwe1023[\"CWE-1023: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    cwe289[\"CWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe187 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1023\n    cwe289 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe289 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe187\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe187 primary\n    class cwe289,cwe863,cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **reliance on request URI** for authentication, leading to a **partial string comparison** and finally results in **authentication filter bypass**.\n  - The root cause is the flawed logic in the `AuthenticationFilter`.\n  - The weakness is the `contains()` method that performs a partial comparison.\n  - The impact is the ability to bypass authentication and access protected resources.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference links. The **AuthenticationFilter relies on request URI** which does not properly validate the URI. The weakness arises from using `contains()` for authentication logic, allowing for bypass via a crafted URL.\n\nThe graph relationships helped prioritize CWE-187 due to its specific nature as a Variant and its direct relevance to the partial string comparison. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section highlights \"**weakness: authentication filter bypass**\" and \"**rootcause: AuthenticationFilter relies on request URI**\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states \"The filter uses `request.getRequestUri().getPath().contains(\"/api/swagger\")` to determine if a request is for the swagger endpoint, which should bypass authentication.\" Also in the content summary, \"The use of `contains()` allows for a bypass by crafting a URL containing `/api/swagger` anywhere within the path. For example, `/api/foo;%2fapi%2fswagger` will match, despite not being the swagger endpoint.\"\n\nCWE-187 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **partial string comparison** issue.\n\n**CWE Considerations:**\n\n*   **CWE-187 Partial String Comparison:** This is the primary CWE because the vulnerability stems directly from the use of `contains()` which performs a partial string comparison. The crafted URL `/api/foo%2fapi%2fswagger` bypasses the authentication filter because it contains `/api/swagger` anywhere in the string. This aligns perfectly with the CWE description: \"The product performs a comparison that only examines a portion of a factor before determining whether there is a match...leading to resultant weaknesses.\"\n\n*   **CWE-289 Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name:** This is a secondary CWE. The crafted URL can be considered an alternate name for the swagger endpoint, allowing bypass of authentication. However, the root cause is more accurately described by CWE-187.\n\n*   **CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization:** This CWE is considered because the product does not correctly perform the authorization check. However, it is a more general description of the vulnerability, and a lower-level CWE is more appropriate.\n\n*   **CWE-287 Improper Authentication:** This CWE is a discouraged CWE. There are more specific CWEs available such as CWE-1390 and CWE-306.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-303, CWE-1390, CWE-807, CWE-302, CWE-288, CWE-1391, CWE-1289, CWE-639, CWE-294, CWE-178, CWE-611, CWE-202, CWE-209, CWE-201, CWE-73, CWE-433, CWE-52, CWE-46, CWE-180, CWE-918, CWE-306 because while they might be related, they do not accurately describe the root cause of the vulnerability.",
