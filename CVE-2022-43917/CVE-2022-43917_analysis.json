CWE-326 is a Class-level CWE, and the analysis considered whether a more specific Base or Variant CWE would be appropriate. However, based on the available information, the general nature of the **weak cryptographic keys** suggests that 'Inadequate Encryption Strength' is the most fitting, despite the lack of specific details. CWE-1391, while a Class, relates to the use of credentials, which, in the context of keys, can be considered related.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe326[\"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n\n    cwe326 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe327 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe326 -- PEEROF --> cwe327\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe326 primary\n    class cwe1391 secondary\n    class cwe693,cwe327 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain begins with the **root cause** of using **weak cryptographic keys**. This leads to the impact of an attacker being able to **decrypt sensitive information**. The vulnerability resides in the containerized version of WebSphere Application Server.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the CWE that best represents the **root cause** of the vulnerability which is the **use of weaker than expected cryptographic keys**. The retriever results suggested several potential CWEs, including CWE-1391, CWE-327, and CWE-326.\n\nCWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) was considered, but the description doesn't specify that the algorithm itself is broken or risky, only that the keys are weak. Therefore, CWE-327 was deemed less appropriate.\n\nCWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength) was chosen as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the **weakness** of the encryption being insufficient for the level of protection required. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"weaker than expected cryptographic keys,\" which aligns with the core concept of inadequate encryption strength.\n\nCWE-1391 (Use of Weak Credentials) was chosen as the secondary CWE because cryptographic keys can be considered a type of credential, and the **weakness** lies in the fact that these keys are easily compromised.\n\nThe evidence for this assessment is primarily derived from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section, which highlights the **root cause** as \"**weak cryptographic keys**.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also supports this by stating that the vulnerability relates to information disclosure in the containerized version of the application server.\n\nThe selection of CWE-326 and CWE-1391 as the primary and secondary CWEs respectively is at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately capture the nature of the vulnerability based on the available evidence. While more specific CWEs might exist, the current description doesn't provide enough detail to justify a more granular classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
