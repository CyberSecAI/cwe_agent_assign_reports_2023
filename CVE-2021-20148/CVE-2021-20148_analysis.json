While other CWEs like CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) were considered, the accessibility of the files under the web root without proper restriction seemed to be the more direct cause. CWE-425 also plays a role, where the application doesn't properly enforce authorization, leading to direct requests.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe552[\"CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass\"]\n    cwe424[\"CWE-424: Improper/Incomplete Enforcement of Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe552\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe288\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe424\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe552 primary\n    class cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with storing sensitive data (password policy files) under the web root, leading to external accessibility. Then, a user can directly request these files, bypassing expected authorization.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the analysis focused on the fact that a user from one domain could obtain the password policy for another domain. The key factor is that the application **fails to properly restrict access to password policy information**.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-552, \"Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\". The description states: \"The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\" This perfectly matches the scenario where password policy files are stored under the web root and accessible to users from different domains.\n\nThe secondary CWE is CWE-425, \"Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\". The description states: \"The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\" This matches the scenario where a user can directly request the password policy file of another domain by crafting a specific URL.\n\nThe retriever results pointed to other relevant CWEs, but they are not as precise as CWE-552 and CWE-425.\n\n*   CWE-219 \"Storage of File with Sensitive Data Under Web Root\" is similar to CWE-552, but the description for CWE-552 matches better.\n*   CWE-639 \"Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\" could be relevant, but the primary issue is the lack of access control on the files themselves, rather than manipulating keys to bypass authorization.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, providing sufficient specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names.
