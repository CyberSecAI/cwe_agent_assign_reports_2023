CWE-290 is a related but less direct classification, representing a broader bypass. The decision favored CWE-620 due to its focus on **unverified password changes** aligning directly with the vulnerability's core mechanism.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe620[\"CWE-620: Unverified Password Change\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe290[\"CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe620 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe290 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe290 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe620 primary\n    class cwe290 secondary\n    class cwe1390,cwe287 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **KDC accepting kpasswd requests encrypted with any key known to it**. This leads to the ability to forge password change requests. This ultimately results in a full domain takeover. The primary weakness is the lack of verification on the encryption key used in the kpasswd request.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, including the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary. The core issue is that **the KDC accepts kpasswd requests encrypted with any key known to it**.\nThis is explicitly supported by the following evidence:\n*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** \"**rootcause:** **The KDC accepts kpasswd requests encrypted with any key known to it**\"\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** \"The Samba Key Distribution Center (KDC) improperly handles Kerberos password change requests (kpasswd). It decrypts these requests without enforcing that only the service's own keys should be used.\" and \"Lack of Key Verification: The KDC does not properly verify that the kpasswd request is encrypted using the kpasswd service's own key. It accepts tickets encrypted with any key known to the KDC.\"\n\nCWE-620 best describes this as it directly addresses situations where \"When setting a new password for a user, the product does not require knowledge of the original password, or using another form of authentication.\" Although the original password isn't being directly bypassed, the KDC accepting any key instead of requiring proper authentication fits the spirit of the CWE.\n\nCWE-290 could also apply because the vulnerability allows for an \"Authentication Bypass by Spoofing,\" where a user can spoof another user's password change request. However, this is a secondary effect of the primary weakness.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-620 being a base-level CWE that accurately captures the **unverified password change** aspect and CWE-290 capturing the broader authentication bypass.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
