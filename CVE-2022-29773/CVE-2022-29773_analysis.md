# Analysis for CVE-2022-29773

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 0.7 | Pillar | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization**, is a child of CWE-284 **Improper Access Control**, indicating a more specific type of access control failure. Since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions incorrect authorization checks, CWE-863 is preferred over its parent. The relationship helps to narrow down the weakness to a specific type of access control issue.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with an **access control issue** due to **insufficient authorization checks**, leading to attackers being able to **access arbitrary scopes**.
  - **Root Cause:** Insufficient or incorrect authorization checks (CWE-863).
  - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to API resources (arbitrary scopes).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified an **access control issue** in AlekSIS-Core that allows attackers to access arbitrary scopes if no allowed scopes are specifically set. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms that the root cause is an **improper access control** and **insufficient authorization checks**, leading to unauthorized access to API resources.

The Retriever Results list several CWEs, including CWE-284 **Improper Access Control**, CWE-732 **Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource**, and CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization**.

CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** is the most appropriate because the vulnerability description and CVE summary explicitly mention that authorization checks are performed but done incorrectly. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section states "**incorrectly allows access to API views**" and "**insufficient authorization checks**". This directly aligns with CWE-863's description: "The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check."

CWE-284 **Improper Access Control** is a high-level Pillar and is discouraged when more specific CWEs are available. While applicable, it is less precise than CWE-863.

CWE-732 **Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource** is less fitting because the vulnerability is not about incorrect assignment of permissions but about the incorrect execution of authorization checks. The retriever result notes misuse of CWE-732 for vulnerabilities where "permissions are not checked, which is an 'authorization' weakness".

The decision is based on the provided evidence, especially the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section and the explicit mention of **insufficient authorization checks**. The graph relationships support narrowing down from CWE-284 to the more specific CWE-863. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-863 directly reflects the described weakness, and using a more general CWE would lose important details about the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.

## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. However, classification research is limited for weaknesses of this type, so there can be gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE that force use of this weakness, even at such a high level of abstraction.

## CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an externally controlled name or reference that resolves to a resource that is outside of the intended control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
