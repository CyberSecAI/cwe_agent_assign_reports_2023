# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-602 | Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security | 1.0 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced my decision was the parent-child relationship between CWE-602 (Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security) and its potential Base-level children. However, based on the provided information, the vulnerability description directly aligns with the characteristics of CWE-602 itself. The absence of server-side validation, as stated in the vulnerability description, perfectly embodies the core concept of CWE-602.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is straightforward: The **lack of server-side validation** (CWE-602) directly leads to potential security vulnerabilities, as client-side controls can be easily bypassed.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis strongly pointed towards CWE-602 (Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security) as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the software "does not employ server-side validation," which perfectly matches the core concept of CWE-602.

The retriever results also highlighted CWE-602 as the top candidate. While the mapping guidance suggests reviewing potential Base-level children of CWE-602, the provided information does not indicate any specific client-side mechanism or protection being bypassed. Therefore, the Class-level CWE-602 is the most appropriate and specific choice in this case.

The evidence is explicit in the vulnerability description, stating the **weakness** as a **lack of server-side validation**: "Safe Software FME Server v2021.2.5 and below **does not employ server-side validation**."

I am confident in this assessment.
