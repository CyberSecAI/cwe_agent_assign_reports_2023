|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-295 | Improper Certificate Validation | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is that CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) is a base CWE, which aligns well with the **root cause** described in the vulnerability. While CWE-297 (Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch) is a variant and could be considered, the description doesn't specifically mention a host mismatch, making CWE-295 the more appropriate and general choice. The other suggested CWEs are less relevant to the core issue of **improper certificate validation**.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper certificate validation** (CWE-295), which leads to a loss of confidentiality. The root cause is the **missing or incorrect validation** in the Openshift Route controller when a re-encrypt Route has its `destinationCACertificate` field set to the default `serviceCA`.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis strongly supports the selection of CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) as the primary CWE for this vulnerability. This decision is based on:

- **Direct Evidence:** The vulnerability description explicitly states "An **Improper Certificate Validation** attack was found in Openshift." The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section also highlights "**Improper Certificate Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper TLS certificate validation...".
- **CWE Description Alignment:** CWE-295 directly addresses the **improper or missing validation** of certificates, which is the core issue here.
- **Mapping Guidance:** CWE-295 is a Base level CWE with an "Allowed" usage, making it a preferred choice when it accurately reflects the vulnerability.

The other CWEs were considered but ultimately deemed less suitable:

- CWE-297 (Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch): While related to certificate validation, it focuses on host mismatch, which is not explicitly mentioned in the vulnerability description.
- CWE-296 (Improper Following of a Certificate's Chain of Trust): This focuses on issues with the chain of trust, which is not the primary issue described.
- CWE-599 (Missing Validation of OpenSSL Certificate): This is too specific to OpenSSL, and the provided information doesn't explicitly state that OpenSSL is the cause.

The selection of CWE-295 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it accurately captures the **root cause** of the vulnerability without being overly specific about the type of certificate issue (e.g., host mismatch, chain of trust). It directly addresses the **improper validation**, which is the core flaw leading to the loss of confidentiality.

## CWE-295: Improper

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-1632

## Vulnerability Description
An **Improper Certificate Validation** attack was found in Openshift. A re-encrypt Route with destinationCACertificate explicitly set to the default serviceCA skips internal Service TLS certificate validation. This flaw allows an attacker to exploit an invalid certificate, resulting in a loss of confidentiality.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Improper Certificate Validation**
- **impact:** loss of confidentiality
- **vector:** re-encrypt Route with destinationCACertificate explicitly set to the default serviceCA
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Openshift

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-1632:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how OpenShift Route controllers validate TLS certificates when a re-encrypt Route is configured. Specifically, when the `destinationCACertificate` field of a re-encrypt Route is explicitly set to the default `serviceCA`, the internal Service TLS certificate validation is skipped.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Certificate Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper TLS certificate validation when a specific configuration is used in re-encrypt Routes, which is setting the `destinationCACertificate` to the default serviceCA. This allows the route to serve content even if the target service and pod certificates differ, violating the expected security protocols.
- **Configuration Dependency**: This issue only occurs when the `destinationCACertificate` field is explicitly set to the default `serviceCA`. If this field is not set, the implicit usage of the default serviceCA will still enforce proper validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Loss of Confidentiality:** An attacker exploiting this vulnerability can potentially bypass the intended TLS certificate verification, potentially leading to a loss of confidentiality. This could allow the attacker to intercept or manipulate the communication between the route and the service/pod.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Re-encrypt Route Configuration:** The attack vector involves configuring a re-encrypt Route with the `destinationCACertificate` field explicitly set to the default `serviceCA`. By doing so, the route skips the necessary validation checks.
- **Invalid Certificate Substitution:** An attacker could potentially exploit the skipped validation to substitute invalid or malicious TLS certificates for the target service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Configure Routes:** An attacker needs the ability to create or modify OpenShift Route configurations within a vulnerable environment.
- **Understanding of OpenShift Route Configuration:** The attacker needs knowledge about how to set the `destinationCACertificate` field to the default `serviceCA` to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

* The bug report mentions that if the `destinationCACertificate` is not explicitly set, the route will correctly show an error page if the certificates are mismatched, indicating the implicit usage of `serviceCA` works as intended.
* This issue is tracked by other related bugs for `ansible-collection-community-kubernetes` on different Fedora versions.
* A Red Hat Knowledge Base solution (6989132) has been created, indicating a fix is available.

In summary, the vulnerability lies in an OpenShift Route controller bypassing certificate validation under specific configurations, which could lead to a loss of confidentiality.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.

### Extended Description
When a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by interfering in the communication path between the host and client. The product might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the product might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships

ChildOf -> CWE-287
PeerOf -> CWE-322

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-12496:** A Go framework for robotics, drones, and IoT devices skips verification of root CA certificates by default.
- **CVE-2014-1266:** chain: incorrect "goto" in Apple SSL product bypasses certificate validation, allowing Adversary-in-the-Middle (AITM) attack (Apple "goto fail" bug). CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).
- **CVE-2021-22909:** Chain: router's firmware update procedure uses curl with "-k" (insecure) option that disables certificate validation (CWE-295), allowing adversary-in-the-middle (AITM) compromise with a malicious firmware image (CWE-494).




## CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product communicates with a host that provides a certificate, but the product does not properly ensure that the certificate is actually associated with that host.

### Extended Description


Even if a certificate is well-formed, signed, and follows the chain of trust, it may simply be a valid certificate for a different site than the site that the product is interacting with. If the certificate's host-specific data is not properly checked - such as the Common Name (CN) in the Subject or the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension of an X.509 certificate - it may be possible for a redirection or spoofing attack to allow a malicious host with a valid certificate to provide data, impersonating a trusted host. In order to ensure data integrity, the certificate must be valid and it must pertain to the site that is being accessed.


Even if the product attempts to check the hostname, it is still possible to incorrectly check the hostname. For example, attackers could create a certificate with a name that begins with a trusted name followed by a NUL byte, which could cause some string-based comparisons to only examine the portion that contains the trusted name.


This weakness can occur even when the product uses Certificate Pinning, if the product does not verify the hostname at the time a certificate is pinned.

- **CVE-2012-5807:** Software for electronic checking does not verify hostname, leading to financial loss.




## CWE-296: Improper Following of a Certificate's Chain of Trust
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not follow, or incorrectly follows, the chain of trust for a certificate back to a trusted root certificate, resulting in incorrect trust of any resource that is associated with that certificate.

### Extended Description


If a system does not follow the chain of trust of a certificate to a root server, the certificate loses all usefulness as a metric of trust. Essentially, the trust gained from a certificate is derived from a chain of trust -- with a reputable trusted entity at the end of that list. The end user must trust that reputable source, and this reputable source must vouch for the resource in question through the medium of the certificate.


In some cases, this trust traverses several entities who vouch for one another. The entity trusted by the end user is at one end of this trust chain, while the certificate-wielding resource is at the other end of the chain. If the user receives a certificate at the end of one of these trust chains and then proceeds to check only that the first link in the chain, no real trust has been derived, since the entire chain must be traversed back to a trusted source to verify the certificate.


There are several ways in which the chain of trust might be broken, including but not limited to:


  - Any certificate in the chain is self-signed, unless it the root.

  - Not every intermediate certificate is checked, starting from the original certificate all the way up to the root certificate.

  - An intermediate, CA-signed certificate does not have the expected Basic Constraints or other important extensions.

  - The root certificate has been compromised or authorized to the wrong party.

## CWE-599: Missing Validation of OpenSSL Certificate
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses OpenSSL and trusts or uses a certificate without using the SSL_get_verify_result() function to ensure that the certificate satisfies all necessary security requirements.

### Extended Description
This could allow an attacker to use an invalid certificate to claim to be a trusted host, use expired certificates, or conduct other attacks that could be detected if the certificate is properly validated.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-295

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** CWE-295 and CWE-599 are very similar, although CWE-599 has a more narrow scope that is only applied to OpenSSL certificates. As a result, other children of CWE-295 can be regarded as children of CWE-599 as well. CWE's use of one-dimensional hierarchical relationships is not well-suited to handle different kinds of abstraction relationships based on concepts like types of resources ("OpenSSL certificate" as a child of "any certificate") and types of behaviors ("not validating expiration" as a child of "improper validation").






## CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product dereferences a pointer that contains a location for memory that was previously valid, but is no longer valid.

### Extended Description
When a product releases memory, but it maintains a pointer to that memory, then the memory might be re-allocated at a later time. If the original pointer is accessed to read or write data, then this could cause the product to read or modify data that is in use by a different function or process. Depending on how the newly-allocated memory is used, this could lead to a denial of service, information exposure, or code execution.

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.

**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of "memory corruption" or "memory safety." As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2008-5013:** access of expired memory address leads to arbitrary code execution
- **CVE-2010-3257:** stale pointer issue leads to denial of service and possibly other consequences
- **CVE-2008-0062:** Chain: a message having an unknown message type may cause a reference to uninitialized memory resulting in a null pointer dereference (CWE-476) or dangling pointer (CWE-825), possibly crashing the system or causing heap corruption.




## CWE-300: Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not adequately verify the identity of actors at both ends of a communication channel, or does not adequately ensure the integrity of the channel, in a way that allows the channel to be accessed or influenced by an actor that is not an endpoint.

### Extended Description
In order to establish secure communication between two parties, it is often important to adequately verify the identity of entities at each end of the communication channel. Inadequate or inconsistent verification may result in insufficient or incorrect identification of either communicating entity. This can have negative consequences such as misplaced trust in the entity at the other end of the channel. An attacker can leverage this by interposing between the communicating entities and masquerading as the original entity. In the absence of sufficient verification of identity, such an attacker can eavesdrop and potentially modify the communication between the original entities.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-923

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-300 is commonly misused for vulnerabilities in which the prerequisites for exploitation require the adversary to be in a privileged "in-the-middle" position.
**Comments:** Consider root-cause weaknesses that allow adversary-in-the-middle attacks to happen, such as CWEs involving poor integrity protection.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The summary identifies multiple distinct possibilities, suggesting that this is a category that must be broken into more specific weaknesses.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2014-1266:** chain: incorrect "goto" in Apple SSL product bypasses certificate validation, allowing Adversry-in-the-Middle (AITM) attack (Apple "goto fail" bug). CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).




## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.

### Extended Description


Attackers might be able to spoof the intended endpoint from a different system or process, thus gaining the same level of access as the intended endpoint.


While this issue frequently involves authentication between network-based clients and servers, other types of communication channels and endpoints can have this weakness.
