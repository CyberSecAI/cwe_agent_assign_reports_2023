CWE-732 **Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource** is also related, but represents a consequence of the initial insecure permission assignment.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    \n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe367 primary\n    class cwe362,cwe732 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with an **incorrect permission assignment** (implicitly related to CWE-732) leading to a **TOCTOU race condition** (CWE-367) and finally resulting in **sensitive information disclosure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on strong evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference. The description explicitly mentions a \"**time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition**\" as the root cause. The CVE reference confirms this, stating that the vulnerability stems from a **TOCTOU race condition** during the creation of a local SQLite database file. The database file is initially created with world-readable permissions, and the library attempts to change the permissions later. This creates a time window where an attacker can access the file.\n\nCWE-367 is chosen as the primary CWE because it directly represents the **TOCTOU race condition** described in the vulnerability. While CWE-732 is also relevant due to the **incorrect initial permission assignment**, it is considered a secondary factor that enables the race condition. CWE-367 is a Base level CWE which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
