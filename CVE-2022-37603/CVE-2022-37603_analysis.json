CWE-1333 is a specific type of inefficient algorithm that uses regular expressions. Since the vulnerability explicitly mentions a regular expression denial of service, CWE-1333 is a more precise and appropriate classification than its parent.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe407 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively straightforward:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity (CWE-1333)\n2.  **Impact:** Denial of Service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis and final conclusion are both strongly supported by the provided evidence. The vulnerability description explicitly states a \"**regular expression denial of service**\" flaw due to \"**regular expression complexity**\".\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary further confirms this, stating, \"A Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) flaw exists... The vulnerability lies in how the `url` variable is processed using regular expressions,\" and highlighting that the vulnerable regex exhibits \"catastrophic backtracking.\"\n\nThe retriever results list CWE-1333 as the top match with a score of 1.000. The relationship analysis highlights that CWE-1333 is a child of CWE-407, making it a more specific and appropriate classification.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: the inefficient regular expression. This is a base-level CWE, aligning with the preference for mapping to base-level causes.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for re-use, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
