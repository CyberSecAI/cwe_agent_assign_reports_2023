# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2021-41989

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-379 | Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-378 | Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE |
| CWE-732 | Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the decision is the parent-child relationship where CWE-379 and CWE-378 are both children of CWE-377 (Insecure Temporary File). CWE-732 is related as it deals with incorrect permission assignments. We are favoring CWE-379 as the best fit because the vulnerability explicitly mentions the temporary file being created in a directory with **insecure permissions**. CWE-378 is considered because it's a more general case of creating a temporary file with **insecure permissions**.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events starts with the creation of a temporary file, followed by the assignment of **insecure permissions** to the directory containing the temporary file. This leads to potential privilege escalation because the temporary files are executed with SYSTEM privileges.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment, supported by the vulnerability description, CVE reference summary, and retriever results, points towards CWE-379 as the most appropriate classification. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the creation of a temporary file in a directory with **insecure permissions**, which aligns perfectly with CWE-379's description. The CVE reference summary further reinforces this by stating that the vulnerability arises from the way Qlik QlikView handles repair operations, which involves creating temporary files in the user's %TEMP% folder with **insecure permissions**. This allows an attacker to manipulate these files and escalate privileges.

CWE-379 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability. Other CWEs considered, such as CWE-378 and CWE-732, are either more general or focus on related but distinct aspects of the vulnerability. Specifically, CWE-378 is a more general case of creating temporary files with **insecure permissions**, while CWE-732 deals with incorrect permission assignments for critical resources in general.

The evidence strongly supports the classification of CWE-379 as the primary weakness, with CWE-378 and CWE-732 as secondary considerations. The final decision is based on the explicit mention of the temporary file being created in a directory with **insecure permissions**, as well as the alignment of the vulnerability's root cause and impact with CWE-379's description.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.83
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1386: Insecure Operation on Windows Junction / Mount Point
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product opens a file or directory, but it does not properly prevent the name from being associated with a junction or mount point to a destination that is outside of the intended control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the file is a symbolic link that resolves to a target outside of the intended control sphere. This could allow an attacker to cause the product to operate on unauthorized files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Opening temporary files without appropriate measures or controls can leave the file, its contents and any function that it impacts vulnerable to attack.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
During installation, installed file permissions are set to allow anyone to modify those files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product creates a temporary file in a directory whose permissions allow unintended actors to determine the file's existence or otherwise access that file.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level
