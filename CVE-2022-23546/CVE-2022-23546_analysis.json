This hierarchical relationship suggests a progression from a general information exposure issue (CWE-200) to the specific case of sensitive data being included in a transmitted message (CWE-201), and finally to the highly specific scenario of using GET requests with sensitive query strings (CWE-598). The choice of CWE-598 reflects the specific technical detail provided in the vulnerability description regarding the use of GET requests.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe598[\"CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe598 -->|CHILDOF| cwe201\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe598 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n    class cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the insecure use of a GET request for the `send_digest` function, leading to the inclusion of sensitive information (admin's digest of recent topics) in the URL. This URL, when accessed (e.g., through a maliciously embedded link), results in the unintended transmission and potential exposure of the sensitive information.\n\nRoot Cause: Insecure use of GET request (CWE-598)\nWeakness: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data (CWE-201)\nImpact: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, all three CWEs (CWE-598, CWE-201, and CWE-200) were considered due to the information exposure aspect of the vulnerability. However, the specific use of GET requests with sensitive query strings in the vulnerability description led to the selection of CWE-598 as the primary CWE. The root cause is the **insecure** use of GET requests, which results in the **exposure** of sensitive data.\n\nThe evidence from \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly states:\n\"The vulnerability stems from the `send_digest` function in Discourse being accessible via a GET request. This allowed the possibility of embedding malicious URLs that would trigger the digest email to be sent, potentially leaking private information contained within the digest.\"\n\nThe graph relationships helped to refine the selection, moving from the more general CWE-200 to the specific CWE-598. The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately reflects the technical details of the vulnerability (the use of GET requests) while also addressing the information exposure aspect.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted

causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials
