There are no direct parent-child relationships evident in the vulnerability description. There is a ChildOf relationship between CWE-1386 and CWE-59 but there is no evidence to support a more general path manipulation issue.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1386[\"CWE-1386: Insecure Operation on Windows Junction / Mount Point\"]\n    cwe59[\"CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe1386 -->|CHILDOF| cwe59\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1386 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of root cause and weaknesses that followed for the Vulnerability Description:\n  - **ROOT CAUSE:** Insecure Operation on Windows Junction / Mount Point (CWE-1386)\n  - **IMPACT:** Elevation of Privilege\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis was based on the vulnerability description, which is very limited. The primary indicator is \"Credential Guard Domain-joined Public Key Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\" which gives a product, component, and impact.\n\nThe primary CWE selected was CWE-1386 **Insecure Operation on Windows Junction / Mount Point** at a confidence of 0.7. This selection was influenced by the retriever results which gave it a high score of 0.546. The description of CWE-1386 seems to match the elevation of privilege as it states \"Depending on the intended action being performed, this could allow an attacker to cause the product to read, write, delete, or otherwise operate on unauthorized files.\". This could lead to elevation of privilege.\nThe evidence is weak due to the limited description.\nThe retriever also suggests CWE-522 **Insufficiently Protected Credentials** which could be present.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
