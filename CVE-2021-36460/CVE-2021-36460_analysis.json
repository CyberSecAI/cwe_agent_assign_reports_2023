This is a child of CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication), which is a broader category. The secondary CWEs are CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash) and CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort), which are related to the specific hashing algorithm used (SHA-1). These CWEs are related through a hierarchical structure, where CWE-1390 is a class, and CWE-836, CWE-328, and CWE-916 are base CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe836[\"CWE-836: Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication\"]\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe836 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe328 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe328\n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe836 primary\n    class cwe328,cwe916 secondary\n    class cwe1390 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weak password hashing** on the client-side. The application then uses the generated hash for authentication, which is sent over the network. An attacker can intercept this hash and use it to take over the account. The chain is: Client-Side **Weak Password Hashing** -> Use of Password Hash for Authentication -> Account Takeover.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-836 as the primary weakness, with CWE-328 and CWE-916 as contributing factors. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" highlight \"**weak password hashing**\" as the root cause. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this by stating that the application uses a flawed authentication mechanism by performing SHA-1 hashing of the password locally. It explicitly mentions \"**Use of Password Hash for Authentication (CWE-836)**\" as the primary vulnerability. The use of SHA-1 is also called out as an \"**Insecure Hashing Algorithm**.\" The relationship graph highlights the hierarchical structure and the connections between the different weaknesses. The decision to focus on CWE-836 is based on the evidence that the hash itself is being used for authentication, while the **weak hash** is a contributing factor that makes the hash easier to compromise. The selected CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity, with CWE-836 being the most accurate representation of the core vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
