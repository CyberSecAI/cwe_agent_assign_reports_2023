CWE-256 is a more specific type, focusing on passwords. CWE-522 is a class-level CWE that could be a parent. The relationship is that CWE-256 is a ChildOf CWE-522. CWE-312 is also a child of CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) and CWE-922 (Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information). Choosing CWE-312 represents a balance between specificity and accuracy, given the available information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe922[\"CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe922\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe256,cwe522,cwe311,cwe922 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper credential storage** (CWE-312) where user credentials are stored in plain clear text.\n2.  **Impact:** A local user can read the stored user credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description and key phrases, clearly points to **improper storage** of credentials. The evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the **root cause** is the storage of user credentials in plain clear text. The Retriever Results further support this by listing CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password), CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials), and CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) as top candidates.\n\nThe primary choice is CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) because it directly addresses the **root cause** described in the vulnerability: \"IBM Maximo Mobile 8.7 and 8.8 stores user credentials in plain clear text which can be read by a local user.\" This CWE is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.\n\nCWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) was considered, but while passwords are credentials, the description refers to \"user credentials\" more generally, suggesting that other sensitive information might also be stored in cleartext. Therefore, CWE-312 is a more accurate fit.\n\nCWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is a Class-level CWE and is less specific than CWE-312. While applicable, it is better to choose the more specific Base-level CWE. The mapping guidance for CWE-522 even suggests examining its children for a better fit.\n\nThe final decision is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description and supporting evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The chosen CWE is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) and aligns with the MITRE mapping guidance.",
