However, in this case, the description clearly indicates an **inefficient algorithm** as the root cause. CWE-400 is a parent of CWE-770 and describes uncontrolled resource consumption, which is a consequence of the inefficient algorithm. CWE-1284 is related to improper validation of quantity in input, which could be a contributing factor. The graph shows that CWE-407 is the parent of CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity), which isn't applicable here as the vulnerability doesn't involve regular expressions.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n\n    cwe407 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe400\n    cwe1284 -->|CAN_CONTRIBUTE_TO| cwe407\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe407 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe1284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **unnecessary quadratic algorithm** (CWE-407) that leads to excessive CPU consumption, resulting in a **CPU denial of service** (CWE-400). Improper input validation of hostname length (CWE-1284) could contribute to the problem by allowing excessively long names to be processed by the inefficient algorithm.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-407 as a strong candidate due to the presence of an **inefficient algorithm**. The vulnerability description clearly states that an **unnecessary quadratic algorithm** exists in the IDNA decoder. This aligns well with the description of CWE-407, which mentions that an algorithm can have an inefficient worst-case computational complexity. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also supports this by stating the root cause is \"An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder.\"\n\nCWE-400 was also considered as it relates to uncontrolled resource consumption, which is the impact of the inefficient algorithm. However, CWE-407 is the more specific root cause.\n\nCWE-1284 was considered because the vulnerability involves an **unreasonably long name**, suggesting a potential lack of input validation.\n\nUltimately, CWE-407 was chosen as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause, which is the **inefficient algorithm**. It is at the class level, but no more specific base or variant CWEs were identified that directly address inefficient algorithms in the retriever results.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: Not relevant, the vulnerability is about an inefficient algorithm not about unsafe equivalence.\n\n## CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product receives a complex input with multiple elements or fields that must be consistent with each other, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually consistent.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: Not relevant, the vulnerability is about an inefficient algorithm not about inconsistent input.\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\n**Rationale for selecting**: The vulnerability description mentions an **unnecessary quadratic algorithm**, which directly relates to inefficient algorithmic complexity.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: The vulnerability isn't about a list of disallowed inputs, it's about algorithmic inefficiency.\n\n## CWE-606: Unchecked Input for Loop Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly check inputs that are used for loop conditions, potentially leading to a denial of service or other consequences because of excessive looping.\n**Rationale for not selecting**: Not directly related.
