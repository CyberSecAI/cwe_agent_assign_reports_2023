# Analysis for CVE-2022-0104

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.8 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-787, which is a base-level CWE. CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is a variant of CWE-787 and is more specific, indicating where the **buffer overflow** occurs. CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is a class-level CWE and is a parent of CWE-787. The choice of CWE-787 is due to it being a base CWE and accurately representing the **out-of-bounds write**. While CWE-122 is more specific, the description provided does not provide enough information to ensure it is heap based, even though the description mentions "heap corruption".

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a crafted HTML page, leading to a **heap buffer overflow** in ANGLE, which results in potential heap corruption.
  - Crafted HTML page -> **Heap Buffer Overflow** (CWE-787/CWE-122) -> Heap Corruption

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the supplementary information. The description clearly states a "**heap buffer overflow**" exists in ANGLE. The primary evidence supporting this is in the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" which indicates the **rootcause** as "**buffer overflow**". Furthermore, the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" lists the "**root_cause**" as "Heap **buffer overflow**" and the "weaknesses" as "Heap **buffer overflow**".

CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability involves writing data beyond the intended boundaries of a buffer. This is a base-level CWE that accurately captures the nature of the **buffer overflow**.

CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) was considered as a more specific option but was not chosen as the primary because although the evidence supports a heap-based issue, the overflow itself might not necessarily be limited to the heap.

CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is a more general class-level CWE, and while applicable, it's less specific than CWE-787. The mapping guidance for CWE-119 discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available.

The selection of CWE-787 is at the optimal level of specificity, accurately reflecting the **out-of-bounds write** condition described in the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-786: Access of Memory Location Before Start of Buffer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available. It also overlaps existing CWE entries and might be deprecated in the future.
