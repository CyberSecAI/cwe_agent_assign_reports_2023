CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is a variant of CWE-787 and is more specific, indicating where the **buffer overflow** occurs. CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is a class-level CWE and is a parent of CWE-787. The choice of CWE-787 is due to it being a base CWE and accurately representing the **out-of-bounds write**. While CWE-122 is more specific, the description provided does not provide enough information to ensure it is heap based, even though the description mentions \"heap corruption\".\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe122,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a crafted HTML page, leading to a **heap buffer overflow** in ANGLE, which results in potential heap corruption.\n  - Crafted HTML page -> **Heap Buffer Overflow** (CWE-787/CWE-122) -> Heap Corruption\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the supplementary information. The description clearly states a \"**heap buffer overflow**\" exists in ANGLE. The primary evidence supporting this is in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" which indicates the **rootcause** as \"**buffer overflow**\". Furthermore, the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" lists the \"**root_cause**\" as \"Heap **buffer overflow**\" and the \"weaknesses\" as \"Heap **buffer overflow**\".\n\nCWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability involves writing data beyond the intended boundaries of a buffer. This is a base-level CWE that accurately captures the nature of the **buffer overflow**.\n\nCWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) was considered as a more specific option but was not chosen as the primary because although the evidence supports a heap-based issue, the overflow itself might not necessarily be limited to the heap.\n\nCWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is a more general class-level CWE, and while applicable, it's less specific than CWE-787. The mapping guidance for CWE-119 discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available.\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 is at the optimal level of specificity, accurately reflecting the **out-of-bounds write** condition described in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-786: Access of Memory Location Before Start of Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available.
