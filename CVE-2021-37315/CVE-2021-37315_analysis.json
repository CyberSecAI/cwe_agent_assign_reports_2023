CWE-184 is a secondary CWE that can precede CWE-22, indicating that an incomplete list of disallowed inputs might contribute to the path traversal vulnerability. CWE-22 is a base-level CWE, providing sufficient specificity for the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe184[\"CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\"]\n    \n    cwe184 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe22\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe184 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **improper sanitation on the source for COPY and MOVE operations**. This leads to the ability to write arbitrary files due to **improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory ('Path Traversal')** (CWE-22). An **incomplete list of disallowed inputs** (CWE-184) might contribute to bypassing the intended restrictions. The final impact is the ability to escalate to RCE by overwriting executable files or modifying internal variables.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-22 as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The root cause is the **improper sanitation** leading to path traversal. The summary explicitly mentions **improper sanitation on the source for COPY and MOVE operations**. The ability to write arbitrary files confirms the path traversal aspect.\n\nThe retriever results highlighted CWE-22 with a high score, further solidifying its selection. The relationship analysis revealed that CWE-184 (Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs) can precede CWE-22, suggesting that a flawed input validation mechanism might contribute to the vulnerability.\n\nThe final assessment concludes that CWE-22 accurately represents the vulnerability, with CWE-184 as a contributing factor. The selection is based on the provided evidence, retriever results, relationship analysis, and mapping guidance. The CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-22 being a base-level CWE and CWE-184 providing additional context.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-784: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of a cookie, but it does not properly ensure that the cookie is valid for the associated user.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-565: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product relies on the existence or values of cookies when performing security-critical operations, but it does not properly ensure that the setting is valid for the associated user.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
