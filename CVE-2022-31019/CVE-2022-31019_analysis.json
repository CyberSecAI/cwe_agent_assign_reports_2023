CWE-674 [Uncontrolled Recursion] is a Class-level CWE, and a child of CWE-834 [Excessive Iteration]. The vulnerability involves uncontrolled recursion leading to a stack overflow, making CWE-674 a potential contributing factor but less specific than CWE-121. The choice of CWE-121 as primary is due to the explicit mention of \"stack overflow\" and the nature of the attack vector.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe674[\"CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe834[\"CWE-834: Excessive Iteration\"]\n\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe674 -->|CHILDOF| cwe834\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe674 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a crafted HTTP request that causes **unbounded stack growth** due to uncontrolled recursion in the `URLEncodedFormDecoder`. This leads to a **stack overflow** (CWE-121) and finally results in a process crash. CWE-674 could be considered as a contributing factor to the unbounded stack growth.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis, supported by the vulnerability description and CVE details, points to a stack overflow caused by unbounded recursion when parsing URL-encoded data.\n\nThe evidence for CWE-121 [Stack-based Buffer Overflow] is strong, given the explicit mention of \"**stack overflow**\" and the description of the attack vector involving crafted requests leading to a process crash. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also mentions the fix including a `maxRecursionDepth` limit and a new test case to prevent regressions.\n\nThe evidence for CWE-674 [Uncontrolled Recursion] is that the **rootcause** of the vulnerability is \"**unbounded stack growth**\". CWE-674 accurately describes the uncontrolled recursion leading to resource exhaustion, but CWE-121 directly represents the resulting stack overflow, making it a more specific and appropriate choice.\n\nThe choice of CWE-121 is at the Variant level, offering the most precise representation of the vulnerability based on the available information. The retriever results also listed CWE-121 as the top result.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this

access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**:

6335.66\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting
