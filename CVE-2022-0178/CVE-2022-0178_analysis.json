It is a child of CWE-284 **Improper Access Control**, which is a Pillar-level CWE. CWE-862 is preferred over CWE-284 due to its greater specificity.

This is based on the explicit **rootcause** of \"**missing authorization**\" and the commit message \"Fixes auth controls on api key creation\". The CWE description matches the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-284 **Improper Access Control** was considered as a higher-level abstraction. However, CWE-862 provides a more specific classification. The mapping guidance for CWE-284 discourages its use due to its high-level nature, recommending more specific descendants like CWE-862.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-862 accurately represents the vulnerability, focusing on the absence of an authorization check. The evidence supports this classification, as the commit directly addresses the **missing authorization** control on API key creation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis CWE was not selected because the vulnerability is not about modifying a key to gain access to another user's data.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis CWE was not selected because the vulnerability is not about an untrusted input bypassing a protection mechanism.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\nThis CWE was not selected because the vulnerability is not about a weak authentication mechanism.
