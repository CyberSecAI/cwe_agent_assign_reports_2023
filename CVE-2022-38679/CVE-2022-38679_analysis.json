Its parents are CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). There are no child CWEs listed, meaning we cannot select a more specific variant.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a **missing permission check** (CWE-862) leading to a local denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description states that there is a \"**missing permission check**\" in a music service, which could lead to a local denial of service.\n\nThe primary CWE match from similar CVE descriptions is CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). The retriever also identifies CWE-862 as the top combined result.\n\nCWE-862 (Missing Authorization): This CWE describes a situation where the product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. This aligns directly with the \"**missing permission check**\" described in the vulnerability.\n\nThe mapping guidance for CWE-862 is \"Allowed-with-Review\" since it is a Class-level CWE. The guidance suggests examining children for a better fit, but no children are provided.\n\nThe description explicitly states the **rootcause** as a **missing permission check**, making CWE-862 the most appropriate choice.\n\nThe other CWEs from the Retriever Results were considered but ultimately rejected because they did not accurately reflect the **rootcause** of the vulnerability:\n\n*   CWE-927 (Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication): This CWE is specific to Android applications and implicit intents, which is not mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n*   CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input): This CWE relates to the validation of quantities, which is not relevant to the **missing permission check**.\n*   CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation): This CWE is too broad and general and does not accurately describe the specific issue of a **missing permission check**. The guidance specifically discourages use of CWE-20 when more specific CWEs are available.\n*   CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition): This CWE describes a race condition vulnerability, which is not mentioned or implied in the vulnerability description.\n*   CWE-650 (Trusting HTTP Permission Methods on the Server Side): This CWE is specific to HTTP permission methods and is not relevant to the general **missing permission check** in the music service.\n*   CWE-386 (Symbolic Name not Mapping to Correct Object): This CWE describes issues with symbolic names and object mapping, which is not mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n*   CWE-1021 (Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames): This CWE is specific to UI rendering and clickjacking attacks, which is not relevant to the **missing permission check**.\n*   CWE-252 (Unchecked Return Value): This CWE is about not checking the return value of a function, which is not the same as a **missing permission check**.\n*   CWE-941 (Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel): This CWE describes issues with communication channels and destinations, which is not relevant to the **missing permission check**.",
