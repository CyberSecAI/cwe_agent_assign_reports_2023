CWE-400 is a class-level CWE that is related to resource exhaustion, which is the impact of the vulnerability. It is discouraged to use CWE-400 because it is high-level and often misused. Therefore, CWE-126 is the more specific and appropriate CWE for this vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe788[\"CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe125\n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe788\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe126 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **buffer over-read (CWE-126)**, caused by a coding error in the SQL query engine memory allocation code. This allows an attacker to cause a **Denial of Service (DoS)** by crafting malicious stored procedures that are imported and executed by a legitimate user.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read)** as the primary weakness, based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference. The CVE reference summary explicitly mentions \"**Buffer Over-read (CWE-126)**\" as the root cause. This is strong evidence supporting the selection of CWE-126.\n\nThe retriever results also listed CWE-126 as a potential candidate, further reinforcing the decision. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-126 is a variant-level CWE, which is more specific than its parent CWEs, making it a better fit.\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) was considered due to the DoS impact, but it is a class-level CWE and is discouraged when more specific CWEs are available. The root cause is the **buffer over-read**, not the uncontrolled resource consumption itself.\n\nThe evidence is sufficient to confidently classify this vulnerability as **CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read)**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
