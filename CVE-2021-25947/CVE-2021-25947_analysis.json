It can precede CWE-471, suggesting a potential chain where prototype pollution leads to modification of assumed-immutable data. The retriever results also suggest considering CWE-843, which can precede CWE-119. This indicates a possible progression from type confusion to memory corruption.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1321[\"CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\"]\n    cwe915[\"CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\"]\n    cwe471[\"CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)\"]\n    cwe843[\"CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe1321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe915\n    cwe1321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    cwe1321 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe471\n    cwe843 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n\n    class cwe1321 primary\n    class cwe915,cwe913,cwe471,cwe843,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Prototype pollution** due to lack of input validation, leading to potential denial of service or remote code execution.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Prototype Pollution** due to the `nestie()` function not validating the input object's properties before assigning values.\n  - **Weakness:** Modification of Object prototype.\n  - **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) or Remote Code Execution (RCE).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The **root cause** is identified as **prototype pollution**, which aligns directly with CWE-1321. The description of CWE-1321, \"The product receives input from an upstream component that specifies attributes that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control modifications of attributes of the object prototype,\" accurately reflects the vulnerability. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary provides strong evidence, stating that \"The `nestie()` function in the `nestie` npm module does not validate the input object's properties before assigning values, allowing an attacker to manipulate the object prototype by injecting `__proto__` properties.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision by highlighting the potential progression from prototype pollution (CWE-1321) to modification of immutable data (CWE-471).\n\nCWE-1321 is selected as it is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability, as it directly addresses the **improperly controlled modification of object prototype attributes**, aligning with the **root cause** described in the vulnerability description. The retriever results also confirm CWE-1321 as the top candidate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
