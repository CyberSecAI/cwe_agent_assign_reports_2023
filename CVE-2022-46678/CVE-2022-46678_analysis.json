The description indicates that an authenticated malicious admin user can edit general client policy for which the user is not authorized.\n\nThe selection of CWE-284 is based on the evidence \"Wyse Management Suite 3.8 and below contain an **improper access control** vulnerability. A authenticated malicious admin user can edit general client policy for which the user is not authorized.\" This directly points to a failure in access control mechanisms. However, due to the high-level nature of CWE-284, CWE-863 was considered as a secondary option because it represents a scenario where authorization checks are performed, but they are incorrect, but it was not selected because it does not fit the root cause details.\n\nCWE-284 is at the optimal level of specificity given the limited information. While more specific CWEs like CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) were considered, there isn't enough evidence to confirm that the vulnerability specifically involves user-controlled keys. Therefore, the broader CWE-284 is more appropriate.\nThe final decision favors CWE-284 due to its direct relevance to the provided description and the lack of specific details that would warrant a more granular CWE.",
