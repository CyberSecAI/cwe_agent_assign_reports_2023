## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory** (**Path Traversal**)." |
| CWE-73 | External Control of File Name or Path | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate file paths, indicating external control of file names or paths. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-22, which represents the core **weakness** of improper pathname limitation leading to path traversal. CWE-73 is included as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability description mentions that the attacker can manipulate parameters to point to arbitrary locations on the file system which clearly indicates external control of file names or paths.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper limitation of a pathname** (CWE-22), which allows an authenticated attacker to manipulate file paths. This leads to external control of file names or paths (CWE-73). Ultimately, this enables arbitrary file system access and the potential installation of custom packages.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified CWE-22 as the primary cause, based on the explicit mention of "**Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory** (**Path Traversal**)" in the vulnerability description.

The vulnerability description states: "**Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory** (**Path Traversal**) vulnerability was discovered via an HTTP API on Western Digital My Cloud Home My Cloud Home Duo and SanDisk ibi devices that could allow an attacker to abuse certain parameters to point to random locations on the file system."

Additionally, the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the root cause: "The vulnerability is a path traversal issue. Certain parameters of the device software can be manipulated to point to arbitrary locations within the file system."

CWE-73 was added as a secondary weakness due to the ability to manipulate file paths. Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.82
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.82
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the file is a symbolic link that resolves to a target outside of the intended control sphere. This could allow an attacker to cause the product to operate on unauthorized files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as "/abs/path" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-62: UNIX Hard Link
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the name is associated with a hard link to a target that is outside of the intended control sphere. This could allow an attacker to cause the product to operate on unauthorized files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-24: Path Traversal: '../filedir'
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize "../" sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 6299.74
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
