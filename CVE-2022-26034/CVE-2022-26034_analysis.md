# Analysis for CVE-2022-26034

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-287 | Improper Authentication | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Discouraged, but selected because no more specific Base CWE fits |
| CWE-653 | Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-287, which is a class-level CWE. While it is generally discouraged to map to class-level CWEs when more specific base-level CWEs exist, in this case, the provided information does not give enough detail to pinpoint a specific authentication weakness. CWE-653 is a peer of CWE-657 (Violation of Secure Design Principles) and a child of CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure). The relationships influenced the selection by providing context but didn't change the primary mapping decision.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper authentication** (CWE-287), leading to the ability for an attacker to use functions provided by the AD server, which can further result in leakage or tampering of data.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis pointed to **improper authentication** as the root cause. The retriever results reinforced this, with CWE-287 being a strong contender. However, CWE-287 is a Class-level CWE, and the mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available. Despite this, none of the more specific CWEs accurately capture the vulnerability based on the evidence provided. The vulnerability description indicates that the system "does not correctly verify the identity of users or processes," aligning directly with CWE-287. CWE-653 was added as a secondary CWE because the affected product doesn't properly isolate the automation design server.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why Not Selected:** While this could be the case, there's no specific evidence to indicate an incorrect *implementation* of an algorithm. The description is more general.

## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why Selected:** The attack leads to using functions provided by AD server, so the **improper authentication** leads to unauthorized access.

## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product violates well-established principles for secure design.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

**Why Not Selected:** Too generic.

## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.

**Why Not Selected:** The issue is not handling insufficient privileges, but the **improper authentication** itself.

## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why Not Selected:** The description doesn't suggest an alternate path or channel.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

**Why Not Selected:** There is no mention of weak credentials being the root cause.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why Not Selected:** This doesn't fit the **improper authentication** context.

## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

**Why Not Selected:** CWE-287 is a better fit as it is less specific about "weakness" in the authentication mechanism.

## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why Not Selected:** There is no information to suggest this.

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

**Why Not Selected:** The problem is with **improper authentication**, not necessarily data authenticity.

## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 4669.75
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
