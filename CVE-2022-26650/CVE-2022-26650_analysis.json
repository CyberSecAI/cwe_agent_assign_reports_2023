The hierarchical structure shows that CWE-1333 is a child of CWE-407, indicating a more general resource consumption issue. CWE-400 is also a class-level weakness related to resource consumption, but CWE-1333 provides a more precise characterization of the vulnerability involving regular expressions. The relationship between CWE-770 and CWE-400 shows how allocating resources without limits contributes to uncontrolled resource consumption.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption of Resources\"]\n\n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe400 -->|ChildOf| cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the use of user-controlled regular expressions in `Pattern.matches()`. The **lack of proper validation** of these expressions leads to inefficient complexity and, ultimately, **resource exhaustion**.\n\nRoot Cause: **Improperly validated, user-controlled regular expression** (CWE-1333)\nImpact: **Resource exhaustion** (CWE-400)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The vulnerability occurs because the application uses `Pattern.matches()` with user-controlled inputs without proper validation. This can lead to an attacker providing malicious regular expressions that cause excessive CPU consumption, leading to a denial of service. The evidence is:\n\n*   \"RegexPredicateJudge.java uses Pattern.matches(conditionData.getParamValue(), realData) to make judgments, where both parameters are controllable by the user.\"\n*   \"This can cause an attacker pass in malicious regular expressions and characters causing a **resource exhaustion**.\"\n*   \"The vulnerability exists due to the use of user-provided regular expressions without proper validation.\"\n*   \"An attacker can cause resource exhaustion by providing malicious regular expressions and input strings.\"\n\nBased on this evidence, CWE-1333, \"Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity,\" is the most appropriate primary CWE. It directly addresses the root cause: the use of a regular expression with potentially exponential complexity due to the user-controlled input.\n\nCWE-400, \"Uncontrolled Resource Consumption,\" is considered as a secondary CWE because it represents the high-level impact of the vulnerability. While resource exhaustion is the result, the root cause is the inefficient regular expression. The mapping guidance for CWE-400 discourages its use when more specific mappings are available, which supports the choice of CWE-1333 as the primary CWE.\n\nCWE-770, \"Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling,\" is also considered as a secondary CWE because the excessive CPU cycles can be considered a resource.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-1333 directly addresses the root cause related to regular expression complexity, while CWE-400 and CWE-770 represent the resulting impact of resource consumption.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n#
