# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-129 | Improper Validation of Array Index | 0.8 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-129, which is a variant of CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) and CWE-1285 (Improper Calculation of Size). CWE-129 can precede CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), CWE-823 (Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset), and CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value). CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a possible result of failing to validate the array index.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper validation of user-supplied data**, leading to a **write past the end of an array**, and ultimately resulting in the **takeover of MySQL Cluster**.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-129 (Improper Validation of Array Index) because the **root cause** identified in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary is "The vulnerability results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a write past the end of an array." CWE-129 directly addresses the **improper validation** aspect and its potential to lead to array index issues. The retriever results also show CWE-129 as the top combined result.

CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is considered as a secondary candidate because the **improper validation** directly leads to writing outside the bounds of an array. This is supported by the CVE details stating "...which can result in a write past the end of an array."

The selection of CWE-129 as the primary and CWE-787 as secondary is based on the evidence provided and their respective relationships. CWE-129 directly addresses the **lack of validation**, while CWE-787 describes the resulting **out-of-bounds write**. The abstraction levels are appropriate, with CWE-129 being a Variant and CWE-787 being a Base. Both have allowed usage according to MITRE's mapping guidance.
