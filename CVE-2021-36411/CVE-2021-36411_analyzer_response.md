# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2021-36411

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 0.5 | Pillar | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is that CWE-125 **(Out-of-bounds Read)** is a child of CWE-119 **(Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer)**, which is a child of CWE-20 **(Improper Input Validation)**. While the root cause is identified as **incorrect access control**, the direct consequence and technical manifestation is an out-of-bounds read. Given the available information, mapping to the base-level CWE-125 is more accurate than stopping at the higher-level class CWE-119 or the Pillar CWE-284 **(Improper Access Control)**.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect access control** (potentially mappable to CWE-284). This leads to an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125), ultimately resulting in a segmentation fault and denial of service. The chain highlights the progression from root cause to impact.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on the stated root cause of **incorrect access control**. However, a deeper analysis revealed that the technical manifestation of the vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read.

The vulnerability description states: "An issue has been found in libde265 v1.0.8 due to **incorrect access control**. A SEGV caused by a READ memory access in function derive_boundaryStrength of deblock.cc has occurred." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this: "**Root cause of vulnerability:** - Incorrect access control in the `derive_boundaryStrength` function within `deblock.cc`. This leads to an out-of-bounds read, resulting in a segmentation fault."

Based on the evidence, CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is the most accurate and specific CWE to represent the vulnerability, as it captures the direct technical flaw. While **incorrect access control** is the root cause, CWE-125 is the direct weakness.

CWE-284 **(Improper Access Control)** was considered because the description explicitly mentions "incorrect access control" as the root cause. However, CWE-284 is a high-level Pillar, and the mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available. The retriever results also list CWE-284 with a lower score. Given the availability of CWE-125, mapping to the more specific weakness is preferable.

CWE-476 **(NULL Pointer Dereference)** was considered because it was a close match in the retriever results. However, the description indicates a READ memory access leading to a segmentation fault, which aligns better with an out-of-bounds read than a NULL pointer dereference.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. However, classification research is limited for weaknesses of this type, so there can be gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE that force use of this weakness, even at such a high level of abstraction.

## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.

## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
