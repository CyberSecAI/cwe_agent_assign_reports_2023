It can be part of a chain with CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input). CWE-416 is a child of CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference) and CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiration or Release). These relationships show a clear path from resource expiration to potential memory corruption.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource after Expiration or Release\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input\"]\n\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe416 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe120\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe825,cwe672,cwe120 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **use after free** condition leading to heap corruption. This means memory is accessed after it has been freed, which can lead to unpredictable behavior, including crashes or arbitrary code execution.\n  - Root Cause: **Use After Free**\n  - Impact: Heap corruption\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is a **use after free** in SwiftShader in Google Chrome. The root cause and weakness are explicitly identified as **use after free**. The impact is heap corruption, which could allow a remote attacker to potentially exploit the system via a crafted HTML page.\n\nThe primary CWE match from similar CVE descriptions is CWE-416, and it also has the highest count. The retriever results also list CWE-416 as a strong candidate.\n\nThe evidence is strong because the description explicitly states \"**use after free**\" as the vulnerability. CWE-416 (Use After Free) is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level. The mapping guidance for CWE-416 allows it.\n\nCWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) was considered but not selected because the root cause is **use after free**, not an out-of-bounds write. Similarly, CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')) was also considered because **use after free** conditions can sometimes arise from race conditions, but there is no evidence of concurrency issues in the description.",
