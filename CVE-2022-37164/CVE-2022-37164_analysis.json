The vulnerability description highlights the use of **insufficient password hashing** (without salt or pepper), directly aligning with CWE-916's focus on password hashes lacking sufficient computational effort.\n\nCWE-307 is a child of CWE-1390, which represents Weak Authentication. While the **weak password policy** could contribute to **weak authentication**, CWE-307 specifically addresses the **lack of rate limiting on authentication attempts**, which enables brute-force attacks.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    cwe307[\"CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe307 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe916 primary\n    class cwe307 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the use of **weak password policy** and **insufficient password hashing**. This allows attackers to perform brute-force attacks, ultimately leading to unauthorized access.\n\nRoot Cause: **Weak password policy**, **Insufficient Password Hashing**\nWeakness: Vulnerability to brute-force attacks\nImpact: Unauthorized Access\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary focus is on the **insufficient password hashing** mechanism, specifically the absence of salt or pepper. The assessment relies heavily on the provided vulnerability description and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" which explicitly state that \"user passwords are hashed without a salt or pepper.\" This directly supports the selection of CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) as the primary CWE.\n\nThe relationship graph shows that CWE-307 is a child of CWE-1390. The weak password policy is considered a secondary aspect that allows for brute-force attacks which aligns with CWE-307 (Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts), but there is no evidence that this product has implemented rate limiting on the number of login attempts or timeouts, therefore it's a weaker match.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-916 is a Base level CWE and precisely captures the weakness in the password hashing mechanism.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not implement sufficient measures to prevent multiple failed authentication attempts within a short time frame.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
