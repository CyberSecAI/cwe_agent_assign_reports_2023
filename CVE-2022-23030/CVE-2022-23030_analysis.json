While it's generally discouraged to map to Class-level CWEs, in this case, it directly aligns with the described impact of increased CPU resource utilization due to undisclosed requests. CWE-400 is child of CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime).\n\nCWE-1176 (Inefficient CPU Computation) is considered as a secondary CWE, as it provides more specific details about the type of resource consumption but is also at the Class level. It is a child of CWE-405 (Asymmetric Resource Consumption).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe1176[\"CWE-1176: Inefficient CPU Computation\"]\n    cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\"]\n    cwe405[\"CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\"]\n    \n    cwe400 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664\n    cwe1176 -->|CHILDOF| cwe405\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe1176 secondary\n    class cwe664,cwe405 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves:\n1.  Undisclosed requests (trigger).\n2.  **Uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400) due to the requests.\n3.  Increased CPU resource utilization (impact).\n\nThe vulnerability description does not specify how the requests lead to resource consumption, creating a missing link in the chain.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the analysis focused on the **impact** of increased CPU resource utilization. The vulnerability description explicitly states that undisclosed requests can cause an increase in CPU resource utilization.\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) aligns well with the described **impact** and is supported by the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" which highlight the **impact** as \"increase in CPU resource utilization\".\n\nThe decision to use CWE-400 is based on the direct relationship between the **undisclosed requests** and the resulting **resource consumption**. While CWE-400 is discouraged for general use, it fits here as the primary weakness since the description focuses on the **uncontrolled allocation** leading to resource exhaustion.\n\nCWE-1176 (Inefficient CPU Computation) was considered as a secondary CWE because it provides more specific information about the CPU consumption.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the Class level because the evidence does not point to a more specific cause, such as memory allocation issues or specific input validation failures. Higher confidence would require more details on the root cause of the **uncontrolled resource consumption**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
