The secondary CWE, CWE-284, represents a broader category of **improper access control**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe620[\"CWE-620: Unverified Password Change\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe620 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe1390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe620 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **improper access control**, specifically allowing a user with an active session to bypass password validations, leading to the ability to change the user's password without proper authentication.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focuses on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The provided evidence indicates that the vulnerability allows an attacker with access to an active user session to change the user's password, bypassing password validations.\n\n**CWE-620: Unverified Password Change**\nThis CWE is the best fit as it directly describes the **weakness** where the product does not require knowledge of the original password or another form of authentication when setting a new password. This matches the vulnerability description which states it's possible to change a user's password, \"bypassing password validations\".\nThe supporting evidence is from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which states \"The vulnerability allows an attacker with access to an active user session to change the user's password, bypassing password validations, potentially setting weak passwords.\"\nMITRE's mapping guidance for CWE-620 states, \"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\"\nConfidence: 0.9\n\n**CWE-284: Improper Access Control**\nThis CWE is considered as a secondary candidate. While the vulnerability does involve **improper access control**, the more specific **lack of password verification** (CWE-620) is a more accurate representation of the root cause. CWE-284 is a broader category and the mapping guidance advises against using it when more specific CWEs are available.\nConfidence: 0.6\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-620 directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, and CWE-284 provides a broader context of the access control issues.",
