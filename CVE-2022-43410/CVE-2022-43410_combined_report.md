## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the CWE selection is the parent-child relationship between CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). Given that the vulnerability description specifies the absence of an authorization check, CWE-862 is a more precise classification than its parent, CWE-285. Additionally, the relationship of CWE-200 (Information Exposure) being a consequence of missing authorization also helped determine the secondary CWE.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check on the `/mercurial/notifyCommit` endpoint, leading to the **exposure of job names** to unauthorized users.
  - Root Cause: **Missing Authorization** (CWE-862)
  - Impact: **Information Exposure** (CWE-200)

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on the **impact** of **information disclosure**, but the root cause is the **missing authorization** check, which led to the final conclusion. The selection is heavily based on the evidence provided in the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" which states, "The vulnerability arises because the endpoint's output reveals which jobs were triggered or scheduled for polling, including jobs that the user doesn't have access to." This directly indicates a **missing authorization** check (CWE-862). The evidence also indicates that this leads to the **exposure of information**, namely job names (CWE-200).

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-862 directly addresses the root cause, and CWE-200 captures the resulting impact.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

**CWE-668** was considered but deemed too high-level. While the vulnerability does involve exposing a resource (job names) to the wrong sphere, CWE-862 and CWE-200 provide a more precise explanation of the root cause and impact, respectively.

**CWE-862: Missing Authorization**
The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.
- **How the vulnerability's details match the CWE's characteristics:** The Mercurial plugin's webhook endpoint `/mercurial/notifyCommit` discloses job names to unauthorized users because it **does not perform an authorization check** to verify if the user has permissions to access the job information.
- **The security implications and potential impact:** Unauthorized users can enumerate configured jobs, which can be a stepping stone for more targeted attacks.
- **Any parent-child relationships or chain patterns that influenced your mapping:** CWE-862 is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), providing a more specific classification.
- **Whether the weakness is primary or secondary in the vulnerability:** Primary.
- **How the official MITRE mapping guidance influenced your decision:** Allowed-with-Review. The description of CWE-862 aligns directly with the vulnerability description.
- **Confidence:** 0.9

**CWE-200: Information Exposure**
The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.
- **How the vulnerability's details match the CWE's characteristics:** The webhook endpoint reveals job names to users who lack permission to access those jobs.
- **The security implications and potential impact:** The exposed job names can be used for reconnaissance and targeted attacks.
- **Any parent-child relationships or chain patterns that influenced your mapping:** CWE-200 stems directly from the **missing authorization** (CWE-862).
- **Whether the weakness is primary or secondary in the vulnerability:** Secondary.
- **How the official MITRE mapping guidance influenced your decision:** The CWE is a class level of abstraction and provides an appropriate description.
- **Confidence:** 0.7

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-43410

## Vulnerability Description
Jenkins Mercurial Plugin 1251.va_b_121f184902 and earlier provides information about which jobs were triggered or scheduled for polling through its webhook endpoint, including jobs the user has no permission to access.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** information disclosure
- **vector:** access webhook endpoint
- **product:** Jenkins Mercurial Plugin
- **version:** 1251.va_b_121f184902 and earlier

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-43410:

**CVE-2022-43410**

* **Vulnerable Plugin:** Mercurial Plugin
* **Root Cause:** The Mercurial plugin's webhook endpoint `/mercurial/notifyCommit` discloses job names to unauthorized users. This endpoint is designed to notify Jenkins of changes to a Mercurial SCM repository, and it triggers polling for all jobs configured with the specified repository. The vulnerability arises because the endpoint's output reveals which jobs were triggered or scheduled for polling, including jobs that the user doesn't have access to.
* **Weakness:** Information disclosure vulnerability. The output of the webhook endpoint provides information about triggered or scheduled jobs, including those that the user has no permission to access.
* **Impact:** Attackers with knowledge of Mercurial repository URLs can obtain information about the existence of Jenkins jobs configured with that repository. This allows unauthorized users to enumerate configured jobs, which can be a stepping stone for more targeted attacks.
* **Attack Vector:**
    *   The `/mercurial/notifyCommit` endpoint can be accessed through GET requests without authentication.
    *   Attackers need to know the Mercurial repository URLs configured within Jenkins to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   The attacker does not require authentication to access the vulnerable endpoint.
    *   The attacker needs knowledge of a Mercurial repository URL configured in Jenkins.

**Summary:**

The Mercurial Plugin's webhook endpoint exposes information about job names to unauthorized users, allowing an attacker who knows a Mercurial repository URL to learn which Jenkins jobs are configured to use it. This vulnerability is addressed in Mercurial Plugin version 1260.vdfb_723cdcc81 and later by checking user permissions before revealing job names.

**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information
- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.
- **CVE-2009-3597:** Web application stores database file under the web root with insufficient access control (CWE-219), allowing direct request.




## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description


Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.


When access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.


### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.

### Extended Description
Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry overlaps many other entries that are not organized around the kind of sensitive information that is exposed. However, because privacy is treated with such importance due to regulations and other factors, and it may be useful for weakness-finding tools to highlight capabilities that detect personal private information instead of system information, it is not clear whether - and how - this entry should be deprecated.

**[Other]** 

There are many types of sensitive information that products must protect from attackers, including system data, communications, configuration, business secrets, intellectual property, and an individual's personal (private) information. Private personal information may include a password, phone number, geographic location, personal messages, credit card number, etc. Private information is important to consider whether the person is a user of the product, or part of a data set that is processed by the product. An exposure of private information does not necessarily prevent the product from working properly, and in fact the exposure might be intended by the developer, e.g. as part of data sharing with other organizations. However, the exposure of personal private information can still be undesirable or explicitly prohibited by law or regulation.


Some types of private information include:


  - Government identifiers, such as Social Security Numbers

  - Contact information, such as home addresses and telephone numbers

  - Geographic location - where the user is (or was)

  - Employment history

  - Financial data - such as credit card numbers, salary, bank accounts, and debts

  - Pictures, video, or audio

  - Behavioral patterns - such as web surfing history, when certain activities are performed, etc.

  - Relationships (and types of relationships) with others - family, friends, contacts, etc.

  - Communications - e-mail addresses, private messages, text messages, chat logs, etc.

  - Health - medical conditions, insurance status, prescription records

  - Account passwords and other credentials

Some of this information may be characterized as PII (Personally Identifiable Information), Protected Health Information (PHI), etc. Categories of private information may overlap or vary based on the intended usage or the policies and practices of a particular industry.

Sometimes data that is not labeled as private can have a privacy implication in a different context. For example, student identification numbers are usually not considered private because there is no explicit and publicly-available mapping to an individual student's personal information. However, if a school generates identification numbers based on student social security numbers, then the identification numbers should be considered private.







## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
**Abstraction:** Base

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-31260:** Chain: a digital asset management program has an undisclosed backdoor in the legacy version of a PHP script (CWE-912) that could allow an unauthenticated user to export metadata (CWE-306)

- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.




## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-200

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Depending on usage, this could be a weakness or a category. Further study of all its children is needed, and the entire sub-tree may need to be clarified. The current organization is based primarily on the exposure of sensitive information as a consequence, instead of as a primary weakness.

**[Maintenance]** There is a close relationship with CWE-552, which is more focused on weaknesses. As a result, it may be more appropriate to convert CWE-538 to a category.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2018-1999036:** SSH password for private key stored in build log




## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.


Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.


When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to "sniff" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples

- **CVE-2022-30312:** Building Controller uses a protocol that transmits authentication credentials in plaintext.
- **CVE-2022-31204:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends password in plaintext.




## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

### Extended Description


Resources such as files and directories may be inadvertently exposed through mechanisms such as insecure permissions, or when a program accidentally operates on the wrong object. For example, a program may intend that private files can only be provided to a specific user. This effectively defines a control sphere that is intended to prevent attackers from accessing these private files. If the file permissions are insecure, then parties other than the user will be able to access those files.


A separate control sphere might effectively require that the user can only access the private files, but not any other files on the system. If the program does not ensure that the user is only requesting private files, then the user might be able to access other files on the system.


In either case, the end result is that a resource has been exposed to the wrong party.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-664

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.
**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** A "control sphere" is a set of resources and behaviors that are accessible to a single actor, or a group of actors. A product's security model will typically define multiple spheres, possibly implicitly. For example, a server might define one sphere for "administrators" who can create new user accounts with subdirectories under /home/server/, and a second sphere might cover the set of users who can create or delete files within their own subdirectories. A third sphere might be "users who are authenticated to the operating system on which the product is installed." Each sphere has different sets of actors and allowable behaviors.
