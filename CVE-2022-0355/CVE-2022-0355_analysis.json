This aligns directly with the vulnerability description. CWE-201, a parent of CWE-212, represents a more general case of inserting sensitive information into sent data, offering a broader classification of the issue. The relationship `CanPrecede` between CWE-212 and CWE-201 suggests that the improper removal could lead to the sensitive information being sent. The base abstraction level of CWE-212 is preferred as it directly addresses the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n\n    cwe212 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe201\n    cwe212 -- CHILDOF --> cwe669[\"CWE-669: Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres\"]\n    cwe201 -- CHILDOF --> cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe212 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n    class cwe669,cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **improper removal of sensitive information** (CWE-212), specifically the \"Cookie\" and \"Authorization\" headers. This leads to the **insertion of sensitive information into sent data** (CWE-201) during the redirect. The final impact is the potential exposure of this sensitive information to unauthorized actors due to the server redirect, which is covered by CWE-200.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points to CWE-212 (\"Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\") as the primary weakness. This is based on the vulnerability description explicitly mentioning \"**Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer**\" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states that the library \"does not properly discard sensitive headers like 'Cookie' and 'Authorization' before making the redirect request.\"\n\nCWE-201 (\"Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\") is considered a secondary candidate as it represents the immediate consequence of the **improper removal**: the inclusion of sensitive headers in the redirected request. The relationship analysis and vulnerability chain further support this classification. The evidence directly supports CWE-212 as the most specific and accurate representation of the root cause.\n\nThe retriever results listed many CWEs to consider, but these are the reasons why they were not selected:\n*   CWE-120 (\"Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\") - Not relevant as there is no buffer copy operation mentioned.\n*   CWE-532 (\"Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\") - Not relevant since it doesn't involve logging.\n*   CWE-613 (\"Insufficient Session Expiration\") - Not relevant since the issue is not about session expiration.\n*   CWE-256 (\"Plaintext Storage of a Password\") - Not relevant as there is no password stored in plaintext.\n*   CWE-922 (\"Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\") - Too generic, CWE-212 is more specific.\n*   CWE-138 (\"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\") - Not specific enough.\n*   CWE-269 (\"Improper Privilege Management\") - Irrelevant to the reported vulnerability.\n*   CWE-316 (\"Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory\") - Not applicable since sensitive information is not stored in memory but sent.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-316: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext in memory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information without properly limiting read or write access by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
