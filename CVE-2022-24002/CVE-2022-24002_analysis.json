This is supported by the vulnerability description indicating an **improper authorization** issue. CWE-863 is a child of both CWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**) and CWE-284 (**Improper Access Control**). Although CWE-863 is a Class, the evidence directly points to an incorrect authorization check, making it a more specific fit than its parents. The relationship of CWE-863 being a child of CWE-285 and CWE-284 helped refine the selection, moving from the more general **improper authorization** to **incorrect authorization**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **improper authorization** (**root cause**) leading to the attacker being able to open a protected activity (**impact**).\nRoot Cause: **Improper Authorization**\nImpact: Open Protected Activity\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the description stating \"**Improper Authorization** vulnerability\" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary mentioning \"**Root cause of vulnerability: Improper authorization**\" and \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper access control**\". The Retriever Results also highlighted CWE-284, CWE-285, and CWE-863 as potential matches.\n\nCWE-284 (**Improper Access Control**) is too high-level (Pillar) and is discouraged by MITRE as it is often misused. CWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**) is a Class and also discouraged but more relevant than CWE-284. CWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**) is a Class and allowed-with-review, suggesting it might have more specific children. However, given the available information and the direct mention of **incorrect authorization** (a failed check), CWE-863 provides the most accurate classification.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-863 is based on the evidence of the **improper authorization** combined with the context of a failed authorization check, making it the most specific and relevant CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** **rootcause: Improper Authorization**\n- **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** **Root cause of vulnerability: Improper authorization**\n- **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper access control**",
