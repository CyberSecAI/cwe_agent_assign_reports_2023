## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **insufficient validation of user-supplied sizes**, which directly relates to CWE-1284. This can lead to an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) if the size is used to allocate memory or copy data.

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient validation of user-supplied sizes** (CWE-1284). This **root cause** leads to a condition where an attacker can provide an invalid size, which, in turn, results in an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) when the system attempts to use the provided size.

## Summary of Analysis
Initially, the vulnerability description points to **insufficient validation of user-supplied sizes**. The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** section explicitly mentions this.

The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** confirms this, stating: "Specifically, the function does not properly validate the `member_cnt` field of the `tipc_mon_domain` struct before using it to determine the size of the `members` array." It further clarifies this leads to "an out-of-bounds write on the stack when the record is copied using `memcpy`."

The **Retriever Results** also show that CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is the top match.

Given this evidence, CWE-1284 is chosen as the primary CWE. The subsequent out-of-bounds write is mapped to CWE-787.

CWE-1284 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied sizes.

### Technical Explanation for CWE-1284:
*   **How the vulnerability's details match the CWE's characteristics:** The vulnerability involves **insufficient validation of user-supplied sizes**. The system uses this size without proper checks, directly aligning with CWE-1284's description of "The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity... but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties."
*   **The security implications and potential impact:** The security implication is that an attacker can control the size parameter, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds write or other memory corruption issues.
*   **Any parent-child relationships or chain patterns that influenced your mapping:** CWE-1284 is a child of CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), highlighting that the root cause is a specific type of input validation failure.
*   **Whether the weakness is primary or secondary in the vulnerability:** CWE-1284 is the primary weakness.
*   **How the official MITRE mapping guidance influenced your decision:** The MITRE mapping guidance recommends using Base-level CWEs, and CWE-1284 is a Base-level CWE.

### Technical Explanation for CWE-787:
*   **How the vulnerability's details match the CWE's characteristics:** The **insufficient validation** can lead to writing data past the end of a buffer, which directly corresponds to CWE-787's description: "The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer."
*   **The security implications and potential impact:** Out-of-bounds writes can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
*   **Any parent-child relationships or chain patterns that influenced your mapping:** CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), which represents a more general class of memory safety issues.
*   **Whether the weakness is primary or secondary in the vulnerability:** CWE-787 is a secondary weakness, resulting from the primary weakness CWE-1284.
*   **How the official MITRE mapping guidance influenced your decision:** The MITRE mapping guidance recommends using Base-level CWEs.

### Other CWEs Considered but Not Used:
*   CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation): While the vulnerability involves input validation, CWE-1284 is a more specific and accurate representation of the weakness.
*   CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer): CWE-787 is more specific in describing the out-of-bounds write.
*   CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling): Considered because the **insufficient validation** could lead to excessive resource allocation, but the primary issue is the validation itself, making CWE-1284 more appropriate.
*   CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read): Not applicable as the vulnerability focuses on writing out of bounds, not reading.
*   CWE-1339 (Insufficient Precision or Accuracy of a Real Number): Not applicable, as the issue doesn't involve real number precision.
*   CWE-1285 (Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input): While similar, CWE-1284 is more general and fits better as it is about any quantity, not just index/position/offset.
*   CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output): Not applicable as the vulnerability is about the size, not the encoding.
*   CWE-909 (Missing Initialization of Resource): Not applicable, as the issue is not about missing initialization.
*   CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size): Not applicable, as the issue is not about buffer size calculation, but rather about validation of the user-supplied sizes.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-43267

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in net/tipc/crypto.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.16. The Transparent Inter-Process Communication (TIPC) functionality allows remote attackers to exploit **insufficient validation of user-supplied sizes** for the MSG_CRYPTO message type.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient validation of user-supplied sizes**
- **attacker:** remote attackers
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **version:** before 5.14.16
- **component:** net/tipc/crypto.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-43267, which is not the correct CVE for this content:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the stack overflow lies in the `tipc_mon_rcv` function within the Linux kernel's Transparent Inter-Process Communication (TIPC) module. Specifically, the function does not properly validate the `member_cnt` field of the `tipc_mon_domain` struct before using it to determine the size of the `members` array. This lack of validation allows a malicious peer to send a crafted domain record with an inflated `member_cnt`, leading to an out-of-bounds write on the stack when the record is copied using `memcpy`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper input validation:** The `tipc_mon_rcv` function fails to check if the `member_cnt` field exceeds `MAX_MON_DOMAIN` before using it in calculations.
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `memcpy` operation, which copies the domain record into a local `struct tipc_mon_domain` variable named `dom_bef` on the stack, is vulnerable to overflow when the record has a `member_cnt` field greater than `MAX_MON_DOMAIN`, leading to an arbitrary write onto the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to a kernel panic, effectively causing a denial of service.
- **Control Flow Hijacking (under specific conditions):** In the absence or bypass of stack canaries/KASLR, the attacker can achieve control flow hijacking, gaining the ability to execute arbitrary code in the kernel by overwriting stack contents. The `CONFIG_FORTIFY_SRC=y` mitigates this.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local or Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited both locally and remotely.
- **TIPC peer-to-peer communication:** An attacker needs to be able to establish a TIPC connection with the target system, acting as a peer node. This allows sending malicious messages containing crafted domain records.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **TIPC Connection:** The attacker needs the ability to establish a TIPC connection with the target, either locally or remotely, by imitating a node in the same cluster.
- **Knowledge of TIPC:** The attacker needs some understanding of the TIPC protocol, particularly the domain monitoring framework, to craft a malicious domain record that bypasses the existing sanity checks before triggering the stack overflow.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability has been present since kernel version 4.8.
- The `CONFIG_FORTIFY_SRC=y` kernel configuration option acts as a mitigation, causing a kernel panic on a stack overflow.

**CVE mismatch:**
The provided content references CVE-2022-0435, which is indeed the proper CVE for this issue, not CVE-2021-43267. The reference to CVE-2021-43267 is incorrect, and likely due to confusion as there was a previous security advisory from SentinelLabs related to TIPC with the incorrect CVE-2021-43267.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.

## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product receives input or data, but it does
        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the
        properties that are required to process the data safely and
        correctly.

### Extended Description


Input validation is a frequently-used technique for checking potentially dangerous inputs in order to ensure that the inputs are safe for processing within the code, or when communicating with other components. When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.


Input validation is not the only technique for processing input, however. Other techniques attempt to transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well (see CWE-138 for more examples.)


Input validation can be applied to:


  - raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.

  - metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size

Data can be simple or structured. Structured data can be composed of many nested layers, composed of combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or structured data.

Many properties of raw data or metadata may need to be validated upon entry into the code, such as:


  - specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.

  - implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size

  - indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures

  - symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.

  - well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax 

  - lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token

  - specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)

  - consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.

  - conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic 

  - equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same

  - authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data

Implied or derived properties of data must often be calculated or inferred by the code itself. Errors in deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor to improper input validation. 

Note that "input validation" has very different meanings to different people, or within different classification schemes. Caution must be used when referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it. For example, some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control to an attacker over an input when they should not be able to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred to as input validation.


Finally, it is important to emphasize that the distinctions between input validation and output escaping are often blurred, and developers must be careful to understand the difference, including how input validation is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a query. The name "O'Reilly" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, this valid name cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the "'" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis. It is also a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Consider lower-level children such as Improper Use of Validation Framework (CWE-1173) or improper validation involving specific types or properties of input such as Specified Quantity (CWE-1284); Specified Index, Position, or Offset (CWE-1285); Syntactic Correctness (CWE-1286); Specified Type (CWE-1287); Consistency within Input (CWE-1288); or Unsafe Equivalence (CWE-1289).
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-1284: Specified Quantity
- CWE-1285: Specified Index, Position, or Offset
- CWE-1286: Syntactic Correctness
- CWE-1287: Specified Type
- CWE-1288: Consistency within Input
- CWE-1289: Unsafe Equivalence
- CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

CWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.


**[Maintenance]** As of 2020, this entry is used more often than preferred, and it is a source of frequent confusion. It is being actively modified for CWE 4.1 and subsequent versions.

**[Maintenance]** Concepts such as validation, data transformation, and neutralization are being refined, so relationships between CWE-20 and other entries such as CWE-707 may change in future versions, along with an update to the Vulnerability Theory document.

**[Maintenance]** Input validation - whether missing or incorrect - is such an essential and widespread part of secure development that it is implicit in many different weaknesses. Traditionally, problems such as buffer overflows and XSS have been classified as input validation problems by many security professionals. However, input validation is not necessarily the only protection mechanism available for avoiding such problems, and in some cases it is not even sufficient. The CWE team has begun capturing these subtleties in chains within the Research Concepts view (CWE-1000), but more work is needed.

**[Terminology]** 

The "input validation" term is extremely common, but it is used in many different ways. In some cases its usage can obscure the real underlying weakness or otherwise hide chaining and composite relationships.


Some people use "input validation" as a general term that covers many different neutralization techniques for ensuring that input is appropriate, such as filtering, canonicalization, and escaping. Others use the term in a more narrow context to simply mean "checking if an input conforms to expectations without changing it." CWE uses this more narrow interpretation.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)
- **CVE-2021-30860:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) leads to integer overflow (CWE-190) in mobile OS, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-118
ChildOf -> CWE-20

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist




## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

### Extended Description


Improper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.


Most products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" is a structured message containing a command ("GET") with a single argument ("/index.html") and metadata about which protocol version is being used ("HTTP/1.1").


If an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness is primary to all weaknesses related to injection (CWE-74) since the inherent nature of injection involves the violation of structured messages.

**[Relationship]** 

CWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.


However, input validation is not always sufficient, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a last name is inserted into a query. The name "O'Reilly" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the "'" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise neutralized. In this case, stripping the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.


**[Terminology]** The usage of the "encoding" and "escaping" terms varies widely. For example, in some programming languages, the terms are used interchangeably, while other languages provide APIs that use both terms for different tasks. This overlapping usage extends to the Web, such as the "escape" JavaScript function whose purpose is stated to be encoding. The concepts of encoding and escaping predate the Web by decades. Given such a context, it is difficult for CWE to adopt a consistent vocabulary that will not be misinterpreted by some constituency.

**[Theoretical]** This is a data/directive boundary error in which data boundaries are not sufficiently enforced before it is sent to a different control sphere.

**[Research Gap]** While many published vulnerabilities are related to insufficient output encoding, there is such an emphasis on input validation as a protection mechanism that the underlying causes are rarely described. Within CVE, the focus is primarily on well-understood issues like cross-site scripting and SQL injection. It is likely that this weakness frequently occurs in custom protocols that support multiple encodings, which are not necessarily detectable with automated techniques.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-41232:** Chain: authentication routine in Go-based agile development product does not escape user name (CWE-116), allowing LDAP injection (CWE-90)
- **CVE-2008-4636:** OS command injection in backup software using shell metacharacters in a filename; correct behavior would require that this filename could not be changed.
- **CVE-2008-0769:** Web application does not set the charset when sending a page to a browser, allowing for XSS exploitation when a browser chooses an unexpected encoding.




## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Often, indexable resources such as memory buffers or files can be accessed using a specific position, index, or offset, such as an index for an array or a position for a file. When untrusted input is not properly validated before it is used as an index, attackers could access (or attempt to access) unauthorized portions of these resources. This could be used to cause buffer overflows, excessive resource allocation, or trigger unexpected failures.

**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product processes a real number with an implementation in which the number's representation does not preserve required accuracy and precision in its fractional part, causing an incorrect result.

### Extended Description


When a security decision or calculation requires highly precise, accurate numbers such as financial calculations or prices, then small variations in the number could be exploited by an attacker. 


There are multiple ways to store the fractional part of a real number in a computer. In all of these cases, there is a limit to the accuracy of recording a fraction. If the fraction can be represented in a fixed number of digits (binary or decimal), there might not be enough digits assigned to represent the number. In other cases the number cannot be represented in a fixed number of digits due to repeating in decimal or binary notation (e.g. 0.333333...) or due to a transcendental number such as Π or √2. Rounding of numbers can lead to situations where the computer results do not adequately match the result of sufficiently accurate math.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2018-16069:** Chain: series of floating-point precision errors (CWE-1339) in a web browser rendering engine causes out-of-bounds read (CWE-125), giving access to cross-origin data
- **CVE-2017-7619:** Chain: rounding error in floating-point calculations (CWE-1339) in image processor leads to infinite loop (CWE-835)
- **CVE-2021-29529:** Chain: machine-learning product can have a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) when some integer-oriented bounds are calculated by using ceiling() and floor() on floating point values (CWE-1339)




## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
OOB read: Shorthand for "Out of bounds" read

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1018:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to read 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2020-11899:** Out-of-bounds read in IP stack used in embedded systems, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.




## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.

### Extended Description


Code frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).

**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. "Resource exhaustion" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..
- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.




## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Memory Corruption: Often used to describe the consequences of writing to memory outside the bounds of a buffer, or to memory that is otherwise invalid.
