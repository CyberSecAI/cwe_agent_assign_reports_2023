This can lead to an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) if the size is used to allocate memory or copy data.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe1284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1284 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient validation of user-supplied sizes** (CWE-1284). This **root cause** leads to a condition where an attacker can provide an invalid size, which, in turn, results in an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) when the system attempts to use the provided size.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability description points to **insufficient validation of user-supplied sizes**. The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** section explicitly mentions this.\n\nThe **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** confirms this, stating: \"Specifically, the function does not properly validate the `member_cnt` field of the `tipc_mon_domain` struct before using it to determine the size of the `members` array.\" It further clarifies this leads to \"an out-of-bounds write on the stack when the record is copied using `memcpy`.\"\n\nThe **Retriever Results** also show that CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is the top match.\n\nGiven this evidence, CWE-1284 is chosen as the primary CWE. The subsequent out-of-bounds write is mapped to CWE-787.\n\nCWE-1284 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied sizes.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 7991.93\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 3.89\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Technical Explanation for CWE-1284:\n*   **How the vulnerability's details match the CWE's characteristics:** The vulnerability involves **insufficient validation of user-supplied sizes**. The system uses this size without proper checks, directly aligning with CWE-1284's description of \"The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity... but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.\"\n*   **The security implications and potential impact:** The security implication is that an attacker can control the size parameter, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds write or other memory corruption issues.\n*   **Any parent-child relationships or chain patterns that influenced your mapping:** CWE-1284 is a child of CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), highlighting that the root cause is a specific type of input validation failure.\n*   **Whether the weakness is primary or secondary in the vulnerability:** CWE-1284 is the primary weakness.\n*   **How the official MITRE mapping guidance influenced your decision:** The MITRE mapping guidance recommends using Base-level CWEs, and CWE-1284 is a Base-level CWE.\n\n### Technical Explanation for CWE-787:\n*   **How the vulnerability's details match the CWE's characteristics:** The **insufficient validation** can lead to writing data past the end of a buffer, which directly corresponds to CWE-787's description: \"The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\"\n*   **The security implications and potential impact:** Out-of-bounds writes can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.\n*   **Any parent-child relationships or chain patterns that influenced your mapping:** CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), which represents a more general class of memory safety issues.\n*   **Whether the weakness is primary or secondary in the vulnerability:** CWE-787 is a secondary weakness, resulting from the primary weakness CWE-1284.\n*   **How the official MITRE mapping guidance influenced your decision:** The MITRE mapping guidance recommends using Base-level CWEs.\n\n### Other CWEs Considered but Not Used:\n*   CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation): While the vulnerability involves input validation, CWE-1284 is a more specific and accurate representation of the weakness.\n*   CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer): CWE-787 is more specific in describing the out-of-bounds write.\n*   CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling): Considered because the **insufficient validation** could lead to excessive resource allocation, but the primary issue is the validation itself, making CWE-1284 more appropriate.\n*   CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read): Not applicable as the vulnerability focuses on writing out of bounds, not reading.\n*   CWE-1339 (Insufficient Precision or Accuracy of a Real Number): Not applicable, as the issue doesn't involve real number precision.\n*   CWE-1285 (Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input): While similar, CWE-1284 is more general and fits better as it is about any quantity, not just index/position/offset.\n*   CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output): Not applicable as the vulnerability is about the size, not the encoding.\n*   CWE-909 (Missing Initialization of Resource): Not applicable, as the issue is not about missing initialization.\n*   CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size): Not applicable, as the issue is not about buffer size calculation, but rather about validation of the user-supplied sizes.",
