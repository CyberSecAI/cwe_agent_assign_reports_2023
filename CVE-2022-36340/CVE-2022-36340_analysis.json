Improper handling of `post-meta` shortcode (Root Cause: **CWE-79**)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis revealed a clear Cross-Site Scripting (**CWE-79**) vulnerability due to the improper handling of the `post-meta` shortcode in the MailOptin plugin.\n\nThe evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section explicitly states: \"* Security: Fixed XSS from post-meta shortcode in email campaign builder.*\" This directly supports the selection of **CWE-79**.\n\nThe confidence in this assessment is high (1.0) due to the direct and explicit evidence linking the vulnerability to Cross-Site Scripting. **CWE-79** is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) as it accurately describes the **WEAKNESS**.\n\n**CWEs Considered But Not Used:**\n\n*   **CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output):** While related to output handling, the core issue is the lack of neutralization of input for web page generation, making **CWE-79** a more precise fit.\n*   **CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) / CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization):** The vulnerability is not primarily related to missing or incorrect authorization checks, but rather to the improper handling of input that leads to XSS.\n*   **CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory 'Path Traversal') / CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path):** These CWEs are related to file path manipulation, which is not the case here.\n*   **CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)):** There's no indication of CSRF in the provided vulnerability description.\n*   **CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor):** The vulnerability description does not mention any exposure of private personal information.\n*   **CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')):** The description does not indicate missing or inadequate authorization on restricted URLs.\n*   **CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data):** The vulnerability description does not mention deserialization of untrusted data.\n*   **CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication):** The description does not suggest any issue with the authentication mechanism.",
