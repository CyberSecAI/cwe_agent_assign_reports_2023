While it's recommended to look for more specific Base-level CWEs, in this case, the description directly states a failure in authorization checks. CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information) and CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) are potential consequences of the authorization failure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n\n    cwe497 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe863\n    cwe201 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe497,cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect role restriction** management based on service custom variables, leading to **incorrect authorization**, ultimately resulting in the **exposure of sensitive host information**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions that \"**If you use service custom variables in role restrictions**, users with said roles may still have access to a collection of content.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states the **weakness** is \"***Incorrect Access Control:*** The core issue is that role-based access control, intended to limit access to specific resources, fails to properly revoke access to host-related data when the associated service objects are decommissioned.\" This points towards an authorization issue.\n\nThe Retriever Results suggested CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) as a potential candidate. Looking at the Complete CWE Specifications for CWE-863, the description \"The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check\" aligns well with the vulnerability description. The \"Mapping Guidance\" suggests \"Allowed-with-Review\" because it's a Class-level CWE, advising to check for more specific children. However, no child CWE adequately captures the **root cause** of the authorization failure itself.\n\nCWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere) is considered a secondary CWE because it describes the *impact* of the failed authorization. The system exposes host information (contactgroups, contacts, hosts, etc.) to unauthorized users.\n\nCWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) is also considered as a secondary CWE since the host information is being inserted into the data being sent to the user.\n\nThe final decision is to map CWE-863 as the primary CWE due to its direct relevance to the **incorrect authorization**, with CWE-497 and CWE-201 as secondary CWEs to represent the resulting information exposure. This provides the optimal level of specificity, focusing on the **root cause** while acknowledging the consequences.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n*Reason for not using CWE-668*: While the vulnerability does expose resources to the wrong sphere, the **root cause** is the incorrect authorization, making CWE-863 a more appropriate primary classification. CWE-497 is more descriptive of the **impact** than CWE-668, and it is at the Base level of abstraction.\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason for not using CWE-266*: The issue isn't directly about assigning the wrong privileges, but about failing to revoke them when services are decommissioned, hence an authorization failure.\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason for not using CWE-653*: This is not an isolation issue, it is an authorization issue.\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason for not using CWE-267*: The vulnerability isn't about unsafe actions associated with privileges, but the **failure** to properly control access based on those privileges when associated services are decommissioned.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n*Reason for not using CWE-274*: The users have the privileges, but are still getting access to things after they should have lost them.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason for using CWE-497*: This CWE describes the impact of the vulnerability, as sensitive system information is being exposed.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names.
