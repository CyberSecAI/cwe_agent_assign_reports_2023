CWE-122 (**Heap-based Buffer Overflow**) is a variant of CWE-787 and represents a more specific case of out-of-bounds write occurring in the heap.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe122 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **heap overflow** (CWE-787), which can lead to malicious code execution. The **heap overflow** itself can be regarded as a specific instance of a more general out-of-bounds write.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed to CWE-787 (**Out-of-bounds Write**) due to the **heap overflow** vulnerability description and the evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section that explicitly mentions \"Heap overflow\".\n\nThe vulnerability description states, \"The bone voice ID TA has a **heap overflow** vulnerability. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may result in malicious code execution.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section also confirms this: \"Heap overflow vulnerability in the bone voice ID trusted application (TA).\"\n\nCWE-787 is a base-level CWE and is preferred. CWE-122 (**Heap-based Buffer Overflow**) was also considered, as the vulnerability is specifically a **heap overflow**. While CWE-122 is more specific, I chose CWE-787 as primary because the description only mentions **heap overflow** and successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution. If more information was available about the root cause that leads to **heap overflow**, then a different CWE may have been considered as primary.\n\nBased on the evidence, CWE-787 is the most appropriate and specific CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Rationale for not using this CWE:*\nThis CWE describes a potential root cause for a buffer overflow, but the provided description does not give any evidence of an incorrect calculation of the buffer size.

resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is
