## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship to consider is the parent-child relationship between CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), as well as the suggested alternative mappings for CWE-284. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a Class-level CWE, and its relationship to CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) is also relevant. The child relationships of CWE-668 could offer more specific classifications, but are not explicitly described in this report.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the application allowing sorting of database query results using protected fields, which can be considered an **improper access control** issue. This leads to an **incorrect authorization** check, as the application fails to prevent an authenticated attacker from accessing protected information. The final impact is the **exposure of sensitive information** to the attacker.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section states that the "**root cause of vulnerability**" is that "The application allows sorting database query results using protected fields" and that the "**weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**" is "**Improper access control** (CWE-284) by not properly restricting access to protected fields when sorting database query results."

The Retriever Results list several candidate CWEs, including CWE-917, CWE-269, CWE-284, CWE-863, and CWE-200.

CWE-284 is discouraged because it is a high-level Pillar. Both CWE-863 and CWE-200 are viable candidates. However, the vulnerability description highlights that an "authenticated attacker could extract information about the contents of a protected field," which strongly suggests CWE-200 as the primary weakness.

The final decision is to assign CWE-200 as the primary CWE, because the ultimate impact is the **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**. CWE-863, **Incorrect Authorization**, is a secondary CWE, as the application does not properly perform the authorization check, allowing access to the protected field.

The selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, with CWE-200 being a Class and CWE-863 being a Class as well. More specific Base or Variant CWEs might exist, but the available evidence does not provide sufficient detail to support a more granular classification.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is "asymmetric."

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.



## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.



## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, i.e., after the resource is no longer needed.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].



## CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an externally controlled name
