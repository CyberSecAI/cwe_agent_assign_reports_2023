This means that the uninitialized pointer is accessed first, and then the code attempts to read data using this pointer. Because the pointer is uninitialized, it is pointing to a random memory location, which results in reading data from outside the intended buffer which leads to the out-of-bounds read. **CWE-824 [Access of Uninitialized Pointer]** is the root cause and **CWE-125 [Out-of-bounds Read]** is a consequence of that root cause. Both are base level CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe824[\"CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe824 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe125\n    cwe824 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe824 primary\n    class cwe125 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **uninitialized pointer** (**CWE-824 [Access of Uninitialized Pointer]**), leading to an **out-of-bounds read** (**CWE-125 [Out-of-bounds Read]**), and potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates an **out-of-bounds read** caused by an **uninitialized pointer**.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"The affected product is vulnerable to an **out-of-bounds read** via **uninitialized pointer**, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\"\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" elaborates: \"The software is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read via an uninitialized pointer\" and indicates that successful exploitation could allow arbitrary code execution.\n\nThe primary CWE is **CWE-824 [Access of Uninitialized Pointer]** because the root cause is the **uninitialized pointer**.
