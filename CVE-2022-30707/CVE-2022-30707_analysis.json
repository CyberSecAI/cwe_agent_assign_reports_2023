While it's generally preferred to map to Base or Variant level CWEs, in this case, the description focuses on a high-level design flaw rather than a specific implementation error. The retriever results also highlight CWE-657 as a top match.\n\nCWE-287 **Improper Authentication** and CWE-732 **Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource** are considered as secondary candidates due to the potential for authentication and permission issues arising from the design violation. These are related as child concepts of higher-level pillars related to authorization.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe657[\"CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n\n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe657\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe657\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe657 primary\n    class cwe287,cwe732 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **violation of secure design principles** (CWE-657), leading to the possibility of compromised credentials being used to access data from other machines. This could also lead to a disabling of CAMS for HIS software functions or information disclosure/alteration. The chain can be summarized as:\nCWE-657 -> Data Access, Denial of Service, Information Disclosure\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided evidence, especially the **rootcause** being a **violation of secure design principles**.\n\n> **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**\n> - **rootcause:** **violation of secure design principles**\n\n> **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**\n> - **Violation of Secure Design Principles (CWE-657):** The core issue is that CAMS for HIS allows a compromised machine to leverage its credentials to access data from other machines running the same software. This indicates a lack of proper security boundaries between CAMS for HIS instances.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision to include CWE-287 and CWE-732 as secondary considerations, although they are not the primary focus of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-657 is selected as it directly addresses the **rootcause**. While more specific CWEs exist, the current information does not pinpoint a specific implementation flaw. The details suggest a broader architectural or design problem.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\nCWE-916 was considered but ruled out. Although credential compromise is mentioned, the **rootcause** isn't directly related to weak password hashing, but to a broader **violation of secure design principles** enabling lateral movement with compromised credentials.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\nCWE-1391 was considered but ruled out. The description highlights the usage of credentials from a compromised machine to access other machines rather than directly employing weak credentials.\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\nCWE-328 was considered but ruled out because it is not directly applicable to the **rootcause**. The vulnerability is not about the hashing algorithm itself but about the design flaw that permits credential misuse.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\nCWE-668 was considered but ruled out. While the impact involves exposing resources, the underlying issue is a broader design flaw that allows for the exposure in the first place.\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\nCWE-405 was considered but ruled out as the **rootcause** is not resource consumption, but rather a design flaw that allows access to other machines with compromised credentials.\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\nCWE-798 was considered but ruled out as there is no indication of hard-coded credentials being the **rootcause**. The issue stems from the misuse of valid credentials due to a design flaw.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\nCWE-303 was considered but ruled out as the vulnerability is not about an incorrect authentication algorithm implementation, but about a **violation of secure design principles**.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\nCWE-345 was considered but ruled out, as the **rootcause** is not related to data authenticity, but rather a design flaw that enables credential misuse for accessing other machines.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\nCWE-226 was considered but ruled out, as the **rootcause** is not related to resource reuse, but rather a design flaw that allows the misuse of credentials from compromised machines.\n\n## CWE-287: Improper Authentication\nCWE-287 was considered but marked as a secondary candidate. It is possible that the design flaw leads to **improper authentication** in how the system verifies the origin of requests from different machines, but this is a consequence of the broader design issue. Therefore, it is not the primary CWE.\n\n## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\nCWE-732 was considered but marked as a secondary candidate. The design flaw might lead to **incorrect permission assignments** that allow the compromised machine to access resources it should not have access to. However, this is a consequence of the broader design issue and not the primary **rootcause**.\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\nCWE-770 was considered but ruled out, as the **rootcause** is not related to resource allocation, but rather a design flaw that allows the misuse of credentials from compromised machines.\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\nCWE-1284 was considered but ruled out, as the **rootcause** is not related to improper validation of input quantity.\n\n## CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool\nCWE-410 was considered but ruled out, as the **rootcause** is not related to an insufficient resource pool.\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\nCWE-789 was considered but ruled out, as the **rootcause** is not related to memory allocation size.\n\n## CWE-603: Use of Client-Side Authentication\nCWE-603 was considered but ruled out, as the **rootcause** is not related to client-side authentication.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\nCWE-190 was considered but ruled out, as the **rootcause** is not related to integer overflow.\n\n## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\nCWE-1325 was considered but ruled out, as the **rootcause** is not related to memory allocation.\n\n## CWE-1339: Insufficient Precision or Accuracy of a Real Number\nCWE-1339 was considered but ruled out, as the **rootcause** is not related to floating point precision.\n\n## CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\nCWE-476 was considered but ruled out, as the **rootcause** is not related to null pointer dereference.\n\n## CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)\nCWE-471 was considered but ruled out, as the **rootcause** is not related to immutable data modification.",
