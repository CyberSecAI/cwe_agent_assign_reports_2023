## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-336, is a Variant of CWE-335 (Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator), which in turn is a child of CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values). The choice of CWE-336 is because the description explicitly states that the "initial value to seed the PRNG is baked-in to the final WebAssembly module", which directly aligns with the definition of CWE-336 (Same Seed). CWE-335 is considered as a secondary candidate because the issue stems from incorrect seed usage. CWE-338 is a viable but less precise secondary candidate since it refers to the use of a cryptographically weak PRNG, which can be a consequence of using the same seed.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **fixed seed for PRNG** (CWE-336), leading to predictable random number generation. This predictability allows attackers to bypass cryptographic security controls, ultimately resulting in the potential disclosure of sensitive data.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified the **root cause** as a **fixed seed for PRNG**, making the generated random numbers predictable. The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary supports this: "The initial value to seed the PRNG (pseudorandom number generator) is baked-in to the final WebAssembly module, making the sequence of random values for that specific WebAssembly module predictable." This maps directly to CWE-336, which describes a PRNG using the same seed each time the product is initialized.

The Retriever Results also support this, with CWE-336 being the top combined result. The relationship graph and the CWE descriptions confirm that CWE-336 is the most specific and appropriate CWE for this vulnerability. The selection of CWE-336 is at the Variant level, providing the most accurate representation of the **weakness**.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-39218

## Vulnerability Description
The JS Compute Runtime for Fastlys Compute@Edge platform provides the environment JavaScript is executed in when using the Compute@Edge JavaScript SDK. In versions prior to 0.5.3, the `Math.random` and `crypto.getRandomValues` methods fail to use sufficiently random values. The initial value to seed the PRNG (pseudorandom number generator) is baked-in to the final WebAssembly module, making the sequence of random values for that specific WebAssembly module predictable. An attacker can use the fixed seed to predict random numbers generated by these functions and bypass cryptographic security controls, for example to disclose sensitive data encrypted by functions that use these generators. The problem has been patched in version 0.5.3. No known workarounds exist.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **fixed seed for PRNG**
- **impact:** bypass cryptographic security controls
- **product:** Fastly's Compute@Edge platform
- **version:** prior to 0.5.3

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The initial seed for the CSPRNG used by `Math.random` and `crypto.getRandomValues` was baked into the WebAssembly module during compilation due to the use of Wizer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Predictable random number generation. The sequence of numbers generated by `Math.random` and `crypto.getRandomValues` was predictable because the seed for the CSPRNG was fixed during compilation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to the WebAssembly module could predict the random numbers generated by these functions. This could be used to bypass cryptographic security controls and potentially disclose sensitive data encrypted by functions using these generators.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs access to the specific WebAssembly module where the affected functions are called.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have access to the WebAssembly module that utilizes the vulnerable random number generation methods.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-336: Same Seed in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) uses the same seed each time the product is initialized.

### Extended Description
Given the deterministic nature of PRNGs, using the same seed for each initialization will lead to the same output in the same order. If an attacker can guess (or knows) the seed, then the attacker may be able to determine the random numbers that will be produced from the PRNG.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-335

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, "randomness" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-39218:** SDK for JavaScript app builder for serverless code uses the same fixed seed for a PRNG, allowing cryptography bypass




## CWE-335: Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) but does not correctly manage seeds.

### Extended Description


 PRNGs are deterministic and, while their output appears random, they cannot actually create entropy. They rely on cryptographically secure and unique seeds for entropy so proper seeding is critical to the secure operation of the PRNG.


 Management of seeds could be broken down into two main areas: 


  -  (1) protecting seeds as cryptographic material (such as a cryptographic key); 

  -  (2) whenever possible, using a uniquely generated seed from a cryptographically secure source 

 PRNGs require a seed as input to generate a stream of numbers that are functionally indistinguishable from random numbers. While the output is, in many cases, sufficient for cryptographic uses, the output of any PRNG is directly determined by the seed provided as input. If the seed can be ascertained by a third party, the entire output of the PRNG can be made known to them. As such, the seed should be kept secret and should ideally not be able to be guessed. For example, the current time may be a poor seed. Knowing the approximate time the PRNG was seeded greatly reduces the possible key space. 

 Seeds do not necessarily need to be unique, but reusing seeds may open up attacks if the seed is discovered.

## CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) in a security context, but the PRNG's algorithm is not cryptographically strong.

### Extended Description


When a non-cryptographic PRNG is used in a cryptographic context, it can expose the cryptography to certain types of attacks.


Often a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is not designed for cryptography. Sometimes a mediocre source of randomness is sufficient or preferable for algorithms that use random numbers. Weak generators generally take less processing power and/or do not use the precious, finite, entropy sources on a system. While such PRNGs might have very useful features, these same features could be used to break the cryptography.
