The choice of CWE-336 is because the description explicitly states that the \"initial value to seed the PRNG is baked-in to the final WebAssembly module\", which directly aligns with the definition of CWE-336 (Same Seed). CWE-335 is considered as a secondary candidate because the issue stems from incorrect seed usage. CWE-338 is a viable but less precise secondary candidate since it refers to the use of a cryptographically weak PRNG, which can be a consequence of using the same seed.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe336[\"CWE-336: Same Seed in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\"]\n    cwe335[\"CWE-335: Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\"]\n    cwe330[\"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\"]\n    cwe338[\"CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\"]\n\n    cwe336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe335\n    cwe335 -->|CHILDOF| cwe330\n    cwe338 -->|CHILDOF| cwe330\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe336 primary\n    class cwe335,cwe338 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **fixed seed for PRNG** (CWE-336), leading to predictable random number generation. This predictability allows attackers to bypass cryptographic security controls, ultimately resulting in the potential disclosure of sensitive data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **root cause** as a **fixed seed for PRNG**, making the generated random numbers predictable. The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary supports this: \"The initial value to seed the PRNG (pseudorandom number generator) is baked-in to the final WebAssembly module, making the sequence of random values for that specific WebAssembly module predictable.\" This maps directly to CWE-336, which describes a PRNG using the same seed each time the product is initialized.\n\nThe Retriever Results also support this, with CWE-336 being the top combined result. The relationship graph and the CWE descriptions confirm that CWE-336 is the most specific and appropriate CWE for this vulnerability. The selection of CWE-336 is at the Variant level, providing the most accurate representation of the **weakness**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-335: Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) but does not correctly manage seeds.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-340: Generation of Predictable Numbers or Identifiers\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a scheme that generates numbers or identifiers that are more predictable than required.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
