# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2022-36487

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The **command injection** occurs because the product doesn't neutralize special elements in the OS command. |
| CWE-77 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary CWE. Considered because the description uses the term "**command injection**," but CWE-78 is more specific since it involves an OS command. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-78 (Base), a child of CWE-77 (Class). CWE-77 is a more general form of command injection, while CWE-78 specifically involves OS commands. The relationship between CWE-77 and CWE-78 is hierarchical, with CWE-78 being a more specific case of CWE-77. The vulnerability involves **command injection** into an OS command, making CWE-78 the better choice.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events is as follows:
1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper neutralization** of special elements in the `command` parameter. (CWE-78)
2.  The `command` parameter is passed to `sprintf` and then to `dosystem`.
3.  The `dosystem` function uses `system` to execute the command.
4.  **Impact:** Arbitrary commands are executed on the system.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified a **command injection** vulnerability in TOTOLINK N350RT. The vulnerability is located in the `setTracerouteCfg` function where the `command` parameter is passed to `sprintf` and then to `dosystem` which executes the command using the `system` function. This leads to **command injection**.

The evidence supporting this is:
> "The `setTracerouteCfg` function in TOTOLINK N350RT (V9.3.5u.6139_B20201216) contains a command injection vulnerability. The `command` parameter is passed to a `sprintf` function and then passed to the `dosystem` function. The `dosystem` function then executes the command using the `system` function, which leads to command injection."

The graph relationships show that CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77, indicating that it's a more specific type of **command injection**. Given that the **injection** occurs in an OS command, CWE-78 is the most appropriate choice.

The selected CWE, CWE-78, is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the optimal level of specificity. It directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: **improper neutralization** of special elements in an OS command.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

*Reason for not selecting it:* CWE-74 is a high-level **injection** class. CWE-78 is a more specific base level that is more appropriate.

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Reason for not selecting it:* This is related to XSS which is not the case here.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Reason for not selecting it:* While an incomplete list of disallowed inputs *could* be a factor, the core issue is the lack of proper neutralization, not necessarily an incomplete list.

## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Reason for not selecting it:* This is specific to Expression Language injection, which is not the vulnerability here.

## CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Reason for not selecting it:* This is for static code injection, which is not the case here. The code is executed dynamically via the `system` call.

## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

*Reason for not selecting it:* Too general. CWE-78 is more specific.

## CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates a query intended to access or manipulate data in a data store such as a database, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that can modify the intended logic of the query.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Reason for not selecting it:* This is for SQL **injection**, which is not the case here.

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity
