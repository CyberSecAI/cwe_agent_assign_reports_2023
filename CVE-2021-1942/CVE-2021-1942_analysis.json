CWE-822 is considered as a secondary candidate, which could occur if the improper permission handling leads to the dereferencing of an untrusted pointer.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe822[\"CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe822 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe822 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of permissions** which leads to memory corruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **improper handling of permissions** leading to memory corruption. The core issue appears to be a failure to properly restrict access to a shared memory region, which could lead to out-of-bounds writes (CWE-787). The retriever results also suggested CWE-822 (Untrusted Pointer Dereference) as a possible candidate, which could occur if the memory region contains pointers that are then dereferenced.\n\nThe evidence for the root cause is: \"**Improper handling of permissions** of a shared memory region can lead to memory corruption\".\n\nCWE-787 is at the Base level of abstraction and directly reflects the **out-of-bounds write** condition, making it the most appropriate primary CWE.\n\nCWE-822 is included as a secondary candidate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-825\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-824\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-823\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-822\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-124\n\nCWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write: This CWE is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions that the **improper handling of permissions** can lead to memory corruption, which is a direct consequence of writing data outside the intended memory boundaries.\n\n## CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product obtains a value from an untrusted source, converts this value to a pointer, and dereferences the resulting pointer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-822 Untrusted Pointer Dereference: This CWE is considered as a secondary CWE because **improper handling of permissions** could lead to a scenario where an untrusted pointer is dereferenced, potentially causing memory corruption.
