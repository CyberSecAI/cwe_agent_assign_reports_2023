The vulnerability can be seen as using an algorithm (RSA) that, when not implemented correctly or when weaker cipher suites are enabled, becomes risky. Thus, while CWE-327 is a good starting point, the analysis considers more specific children for a better fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe1240[\"CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\"]\n    cwe757[\"CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe1240 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    cwe757 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe311 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe327 primary\n    class cwe1240,cwe757,cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the following steps:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **TLS-RSA cipher suites are not disabled**.\n2.  **Weakness:** The system uses potentially weak or broken cryptographic algorithms due to the availability of TLS-RSA.\n3.  **Impact:** An attacker can passively record traffic and later decrypt it, leading to information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified several candidate CWEs, with CWE-327 as a strong contender due to the use of potentially risky cryptographic algorithms. The key phrase \"**TLS-RSA cipher suites are not disabled**\" from the vulnerability description directly supports this. However, further analysis considered the more specific base-level children of CWE-327.\n\nCWE-1240 (Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation) was also considered, as the issue revolves around the implementation and configuration of cryptographic primitives.\n\nCWE-757 (Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')) was considered since the vulnerability involves the potential negotiation of weaker ciphers.\n\nCWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) was considered because the ultimate impact is the ability to decrypt traffic, effectively leading to cleartext transmission. However, the primary issue is the use of weak ciphers, not necessarily a direct transmission in cleartext.\n\nThe final decision favored CWE-327 as the primary CWE, as it accurately reflects the core issue of using potentially broken or risky cryptographic algorithms. While CWE-1240 and CWE-757 offer more granularity, CWE-327 provides a suitable balance between specificity and broad applicability to the vulnerability. The other CWEs are listed as secondary candidates.\n\nThe selection is based on the available evidence and the CWE specifications, focusing on the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA protocol or its implementation supports interaction between multiple actors and allows those actors to negotiate which algorithm should be used as a protection mechanism such as encryption or authentication, but it does not select the strongest algorithm that is available to both parties.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a cryptographic primitive that uses an Initialization Vector (IV), but the product does not generate IVs that are sufficiently unpredictable or unique according to the expected cryptographic requirements for that primitive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
