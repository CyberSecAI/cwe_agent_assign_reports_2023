The vulnerability is clearly described as a **stack-based buffer overflow** in the registration field of Modbus Slave. This occurs because the software doesn't properly validate the length of the input, leading to a crash when a long string is used.\n\nThe evidence supporting this is:\n*   \"Modbus Tools Modbus Slave (versions 7.4.2 and prior) is vulnerable to a **stack-based buffer overflow** in the registration field.\"\n*   \"The vulnerability is a **stack-based buffer overflow** in the registration field of the Modbus Slave software. This occurs when the software doesn't properly validate the length of the input provided for the registration key.\"\n*   \"The primary impact is that the application crashes when a long string is provided in the registration field.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-121 is at the optimal level of specificity because the vulnerability is explicitly a **stack-based buffer overflow**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because the description explicitly states that it is a stack based buffer overflow.
