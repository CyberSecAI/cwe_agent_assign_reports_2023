It is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), which is itself a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-200 (Information Exposure). The choice of CWE-862 is more specific than its parents and focuses on the lack of authorization check. CWE-359 is added as a secondary CWE to specify the impact of the missing authorization.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe359 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284,cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Missing Authorization (CWE-862):** The `/adminGetUserList` endpoint lacks proper authorization checks. This is the root cause.\n2.  **Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-359):** Due to the missing authorization, an attacker can access sensitive user information. This is the direct impact of the missing authorization.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly states that the vulnerability is due to the **lack of proper authorization** checks in the `/adminGetUserList` endpoint, allowing an attacker to obtain sensitive user information.\n\nThe **root cause** of the vulnerability is the **missing authorization**, which directly leads to the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is justified by the vulnerability description, which states that the endpoint allows access to sensitive user information without proper permission checks.\nThe CWE-359 describes the impact of the vulnerability which is the Exposure of Private Personal Information.\n\nThe provided \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly states: \"The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks before allowing access to the `/adminGetUserList` endpoint. This allows unauthorized users to access sensitive data.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 aligns with the mapping guidance, as it is a more specific Class-level CWE than its parents, CWE-285 and CWE-284. While CWE-862 is a Class, the description matches the vulnerability well and a more specific CWE is not available given the level of information.\n\nCWE-359 is chosen to represent the impact.\n\nOther CWEs Considered but Not Used:\n\n*   CWE-285 (Improper Authorization): While related, it is too high-level and the description matches CWE-862 more closely. The mapping guidance for CWE-285 suggests considering its children, such as CWE-862.\n*   CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization): This CWE implies that an authorization check is performed, but it is done incorrectly. The vulnerability description clearly states that there is a missing authorization check.\n*   CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource): This is about incorrect assignment of permission, not about missing authorization.\n*   CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type): Irrelevant, as it deals with file uploads, not authorization.\n*   CWE-471 (Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)): Not applicable, as the vulnerability isn't related to modifying assumed-immutable data.\n*   CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison): Not applicable, as there is no comparison operation involved in the vulnerability.\n*   CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management): Too general; CWE-862 describes the issue more precisely.",
