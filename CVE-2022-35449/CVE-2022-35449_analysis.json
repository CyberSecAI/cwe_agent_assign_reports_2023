CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-787.\nThe vulnerability description indicates a heap buffer overflow, which can be further specified with CWE-122. However, the description primarily indicates an out-of-bounds write, making CWE-787 the more direct fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe122,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **heap-buffer overflow**, leading to an out-of-bounds write. The root cause is likely due to **insufficient bounds checking** when writing data to the heap buffer.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed towards CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) due to the explicit mention of a **heap-buffer overflow** and the **insufficient bounds checking** root cause evidence. The primary CWE match and top CWEs in similar CVE descriptions also indicated CWE-787.\n\nThe analysis considered the provided evidence and the relationships between CWEs. The final decision was to select CWE-787 as the primary CWE, with CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) as a secondary candidate. While CWE-122 is more specific, the vulnerability description focused on the out-of-bounds write aspect rather than the heap allocation, making CWE-787 a more accurate fit. CWE-119 was also considered but discouraged as it is too high-level.\n\nThe evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section supports the selection of CWE-787, as it indicates that the **root cause** of the vulnerability is **insufficient bounds checking** when copying data to heap buffers, leading to writing beyond the allocated memory region.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\nNot selected as there is no evidence of Integer Underflow.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\nNot selected as there is no evidence of incorrect calculation of buffer size.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\nNot selected as the primary issue is an out-of-bounds write.\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\nNot selected as there is no evidence of incorrect conversion between numeric types.\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\nNot selected as the primary issue is an out-of-bounds write.\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\nNot selected as the vulnerability description does not suggest an off-by-one error, but rather a more general out-of-bounds write.\n\n## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\nNot selected as there is no evidence of improper validation of array index.\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\nNot selected as the primary issue is an out-of-bounds write.\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\nNot selected as there is no evidence of incorrect length value.\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\nNot selected as there is no evidence of truncation error.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6836.02\n**Source**: sparse\nNot selected as there is no evidence of Integer Overflow.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6625.53\n**Source**: sparse\nNot selected as the primary issue is an out-of-bounds write.\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6321.29\n**Source**: sparse\nNot selected as the vulnerability description does not suggest an off-by-one error, but rather a more general out-of-bounds write.\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6204.88\n**Source**: sparse\nNot selected as there is no evidence of improper validation of specified quantity in the input.\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 6140.55\n**Source**: sparse\nConsidered but discouraged due to being too high-level.
