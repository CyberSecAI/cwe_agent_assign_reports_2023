CWE-472 (External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter) is a base CWE and a child of CWE-642 and CWE-471. CWE-863 is a Class that is a ChildOf CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). The relationships influenced the selection by helping to confirm that CWE-784 was the most specific and appropriate choice, while CWE-472 and CWE-863 could be related but less specific.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe784[\"CWE-784: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision\"]\n    cwe807[\"CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\"]\n    cwe565[\"CWE-565: Reliance on Obfuscation\"]\n    cwe472[\"CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\"]\n    cwe642[\"CWE-642: External Control of Critical State Data\"]\n    cwe471[\"CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe784 -->|CHILDOF| cwe807\n    cwe784 -->|CHILDOF| cwe565\n    cwe472 -->|CHILDOF| cwe642\n    cwe472 -->|CHILDOF| cwe471\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe784 primary\n    class cwe472,cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe807,cwe565,cwe642,cwe471,cwe285,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **reliance on cookies without proper validation**. An attacker can **modify the cookie values** (is_admin, showConfig) to **elevate privileges** from a guest to an administrator.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered the ability to **elevate privileges** by **changing cookie values**. The Retriever Results suggested CWE-784, CWE-472, and CWE-863 as potential candidates.\n\nThe final decision was based on the following:\n\n*   CWE-784 (Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision): This is the most specific CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly states that the attacker can elevate privileges by modifying cookie values. The description of CWE-784 matches the vulnerability: \"The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of a cookie, but it does not properly ensure that the cookie is valid for the associated user.\"\n*   CWE-472 (External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter): This CWE is relevant because cookies can be considered assumed-immutable web parameters. However, CWE-784 is a more precise fit.\n*   CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization): While the vulnerability leads to incorrect authorization, the root cause is the improper handling of cookies.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-784 directly addresses the **reliance on cookies without validation**, while the others are higher-level or less directly related. The evidence from the vulnerability description supports this classification: \"attacker with web access can elevate privileges to administrative 1 to 0 privileges by **changing the following cookie values** from is_admin, showConfig.\"\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-784: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that **relies on the existence or values of a cookie**, but it does not properly ensure that the cookie is valid for the associated user.\n\n### Extended Description\nAttackers can easily modify cookies, within the browser or by implementing the client-side code outside of the browser. Attackers can bypass protection mechanisms such as authorization and authentication by modifying the cookie to contain an expected value.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction:** Base\n\n### Description\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n### Extended Description\nIf a web product does not properly protect assumed-immutable values from modification in hidden form fields, parameters, cookies, or URLs, this can lead to modification of critical data.\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.",
