It is a child of CWE-287 **Improper Authentication**.\n\nCWE-345 **Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity** is a Class level CWE and a parent of more specific CWEs. Therefore, CWE-295 is more specific and better suited.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe295[\"CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n\n    cwe295 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe345 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe295 primary\n    class cwe287,cwe345 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events can be described as follows:\n1.  The certifi package included root certificates from TrustCor.\n2.  Concerns arose about TrustCor's trustworthiness due to its connections to a spyware company.\n3.  This led to the potential for **Improper Certificate Validation** (CWE-295) because the included certificates might be compromised or maliciously used.\n4.  The certifi package removed the TrustCor root certificates to mitigate the risk.\n\nThe root cause is the inclusion of potentially compromised certificates, leading to the potential for data modification and MitM attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the vulnerability description, CVE reference links, and retriever results to determine the most appropriate CWE. The primary concern was the inclusion of TrustCor root certificates in the certifi package, which led to the potential for **Improper Certificate Validation** (CWE-295).\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision is as follows:\n\n*   Vulnerability Description: \"Certifi 2022.12.07 removes root certificates from TrustCor from the root store.\"\n*   CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"The vulnerability isn't due to a flaw in the certifi package itself, but rather the inclusion of TrustCor root certificates, which were later deemed untrustworthy.\" and \"Compromised Trust: The primary weakness is that the trust placed in the TrustCor root certificates was compromised, as they were linked to a company that produced spyware.\"\n\nThe retriever results also suggested considering CWE-295 **Improper Certificate Validation**. The retriever results also included CWE-345 **Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity**. However, CWE-295 is more specific as it directly addresses the certificate validation issue, while CWE-345 is a more general class.\n\nThe selected CWE, CWE-295 **Improper Certificate Validation**, is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability: the inclusion and potential use of untrustworthy certificates.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
