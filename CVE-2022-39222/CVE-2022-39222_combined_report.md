## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-639, which is a Base level CWE and a child of CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). This indicates a specific type of authorization issue where a user-controlled key is used to bypass authorization checks. CWE-807 (Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision) can precede CWE-639, as the bypass is possible due to the system relying on an input that the user controls, this is further compounded by CWE-201 because the attacker is able to use the information to poll the `/approval` endpoint

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper OAuth configuration**, leading to a predictable request ID. The attacker can then use this predictable ID to poll the `/approval` endpoint and steal the OAuth authorization code. Finally, the attacker can exchange the authorization code for a token, gaining unauthorized access.

Root Cause: **Improper OAuth configuration** (Inferred CWE) -> CWE-807 (Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision) -> CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) -> CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) -> Unauthorized Access

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference links, points towards an authorization bypass vulnerability due to a predictable request ID. The primary CWE, CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key), accurately captures the essence of the vulnerability, where an attacker can modify a user-controlled key (the state parameter) to gain unauthorized access.

The evidence supporting this decision is derived from the following:

*   Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: "**improper OAuth configuration**"
*   CVE Reference Links Content Summary: "The vulnerability stems from a predictable request ID used in the `/approval` endpoint, which allowed an attacker to fetch the OAuth authorization code before the legitimate user... The Dex instance used the state parameter received during the initial redirect to the connector IDP as the request ID, which was not protected."

The retriever results also supports CWE-639 as the top match, and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) which is a parent of CWE-639.

CWE-807 is a contributing factor because the system relies on the state parameter which can be manipulated by the attacker to gain access. CWE-201 is also a contributing factor because the attacker is able to obtain information to poll the `/approval` endpoint.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-639 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred. Although CWE-863 is a Class, it is a parent of CWE-639 and less specific to the vulnerability.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-39222

## Vulnerability Description
Dex is an identity service that uses OpenID Connect to drive authentication for other apps. Dex instances with public clients (and by extension, clients accepting tokens issued by those Dex instances) are affected by this vulnerability if they are running a version prior to 2.35.0. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by making a victim navigate to a malicious website and guiding them through the OIDC flow, stealing the OAuth authorization code in the process. The authorization code then can be exchanged by the attacker for a token, gaining access to applications accepting that token. Version 2.35.0 has introduced a fix for this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper OAuth configuration**
- **impact:** information disclosure
- **vector:** malicious website
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Dex
- **version:** prior to 2.35.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-39222:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a predictable request ID used in the `/approval` endpoint, which allowed an attacker to fetch the OAuth authorization code before the legitimate user. The Dex instance used the state parameter received during the initial redirect to the connector IDP as the request ID, which was not protected. This allowed an attacker to repeatedly poll the `/approval` endpoint using the known state and potentially intercept the authorization code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Predictable request ID:** The use of the state parameter as the request ID for the `/approval` endpoint made it predictable and vulnerable to interception.
- **Lack of message authentication:** The absence of message authentication or any mechanism to verify the legitimacy of the `/approval` request allowed the attacker to forge requests.
- **Backchannel attack:** The vulnerability allowed an attacker to use a side channel (polling the approval endpoint) to steal the authorization code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized access:** By intercepting the authorization code, the attacker could exchange it for an ID token, gaining unauthorized access to applications that accept tokens from the vulnerable Dex instance.
- **Account takeover:** If the targeted applications were not protected against replay attacks, the attacker could potentially gain full control of a victim's account.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious website:** The attack is initiated by luring a victim to a malicious website.
- **OIDC flow manipulation:** The attacker guides the victim through a manipulated OIDC flow, intercepting the authorization code.
- **Polling the `/approval` endpoint:** The attacker polls the `/approval` endpoint using the predictable request ID to obtain the OAuth code before the legitimate user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to create a malicious website:** The attacker needs to host a website to initiate the attack.
- **Ability to intercept the OIDC flow:** The attacker needs to intercept the redirect from dex to the IDP and the return redirect to dex.
- **Ability to make HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to make HTTP requests to the `/approval` endpoint.
- **Knowledge of the state parameter:** The attacker needs to obtain and know the value of the state parameter.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- **Mitigation:** The fix involves adding an HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) using a randomly generated per-request secret. This makes the request ID unpredictable and prevents the attacker from polling `/approval` endpoint. The HMAC key is stored within the auth request object and validated on access to `/approval`.
- **Affected Versions:** Dex versions <= 2.34.0 are affected.
- **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.35.0.
- **Workarounds:** Disabling public clients is the only known workaround, which impacts behavior.
- **CVSS Score:** The CVSS score is 9.3, categorized as critical.
- **Attack Complexity:** The attack complexity is low.
- **User interaction:** User interaction is required.
- **Scope:** The scope is changed, meaning a vulnerable component can impact resources outside its security scope.
- **Confidentiality & Integrity:** The impact on confidentiality and integrity is high.

The commit diff shows the changes made to address this vulnerability, specifically the addition of HMAC verification in `server/handlers.go` and `server/oauth2.go`, changes to the storage layer to persist the HMAC key as well.

## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description


Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.


When access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.


### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information
- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.
- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.




## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.

### Extended Description


Attackers at the destination may be able to spoof trusted servers to steal data or cause a denial of service.


There are at least two distinct weaknesses that can cause the product to communicate with an unintended destination:


  - If the product allows an attacker to control which destination is specified, then the attacker can cause it to connect to an untrusted or malicious destination. For example, because UDP is a connectionless protocol, UDP packets can be spoofed by specifying a false source address in the packet; when the server receives the packet and sends a reply, it will specify a destination by using the source of the incoming packet - i.e., the false source. The server can then be tricked into sending traffic to the wrong host, which is effective for hiding the real source of an attack and for conducting a distributed denial of service (DDoS). As another example, server-side request forgery (SSRF) and XML External Entity (XXE) can be used to trick a server into making outgoing requests to hosts that cannot be directly accessed by the attacker due to firewall restrictions.

  - If the product incorrectly specifies the destination, then an attacker who can control this destination might be able to spoof trusted servers. While the most common occurrence is likely due to misconfiguration by an administrator, this can be resultant from other weaknesses. For example, the product might incorrectly parse an e-mail or IP address and send sensitive data to an unintended destination. As another example, an Android application may use a "sticky broadcast" to communicate with a receiver for a particular application, but since sticky broadcasts can be processed by *any* receiver, this can allow a malicious application to access restricted data that was only intended for a different application.



### Alternative Terms

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-923
CanPrecede -> CWE-406

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2013-5211:** composite: NTP feature generates large responses (high amplification factor) with spoofed UDP source addresses.
- **CVE-1999-0513:** Classic "Smurf" attack, using spoofed ICMP packets to broadcast addresses.
- **CVE-1999-1379:** DNS query with spoofed source address causes more traffic to be returned to spoofed address than was sent by the attacker.




## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

### Extended Description


When resources are released, they can be made available for reuse. For example, after memory is de-allocated, an operating system may make the memory available to another process, or disk space may be reallocated when a file is deleted. As removing information requires time and additional resources, operating systems do not usually clear the previously written information.


Even when the resource is reused by the same process, this weakness can arise when new data is not as large as the old data, which leaves portions of the old data still available. Equivalent errors can occur in other situations where the length of data is variable but the associated data structure is not. If memory is not cleared after use, the information may be read by less trustworthy parties when the memory is reallocated.


This weakness can apply in hardware, such as when a device or system switches between power, sleep, or debug states during normal operation, or when execution changes to different users or privilege levels.


### Alternative Terms

**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).

**[Maintenance]** This entry needs modification to clarify the differences with CWE-212. The description also combines two problems that are distinct from the CWE research perspective: the inadvertent transfer of information to another sphere, and improper initialization/shutdown. Some of the associated taxonomy mappings reflect these different uses.

**[Research Gap]** This is frequently found for network packets, but it can also exist in local memory allocation, files, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release
- **CVE-2003-0001:** Ethernet NIC drivers do not pad frames with null bytes, leading to infoleak from malformed packets.

### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information
- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.
- **CVE-2009-3597:** Web application stores database file under the web root with insufficient access control (CWE-219), allowing direct request.




## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

### Extended Description


Retrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.


For example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.


One manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.


### Alternative Terms
Insecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The "Insecure Direct Object Reference" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.
Broken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.
Horizontal Authorization: "Horizontal Authorization" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.
