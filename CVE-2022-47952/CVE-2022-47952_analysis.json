CWE-204 is a more specific instance of CWE-203. Because the vulnerability is about the product providing different responses that reveal internal state, CWE-203 is a better fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe203[\"CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe204[\"CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\"]\n\n    cwe204 -->|CHILDOF| cwe203\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe203 primary\n    class cwe204 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lxc-user-nic binary being setuid root**. This leads to the program's ability to access files with elevated privileges. Because of **lack of proper error handling**, the program returns different error messages depending on whether the file exists, resulting in **information disclosure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered the different CWEs presented, particularly CWE-203 and CWE-204. The final decision was based on the evidence that the program provides different responses based on the existence of a file. This fits the description of CWE-203, which is that \"The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\"\n\nThe evidence for this mapping is: \"Failed to open often indicates that a file does not exist, whereas does not refer to a network namespace path often indicates that a file exists.\"\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the **root cause** of the information disclosure vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.83\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the file is a symbolic link that resolves to a target outside of the intended control sphere. This could allow an attacker to cause the product to operate on unauthorized files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-62: UNIX Hard Link\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the name is associated with a hard link to a target that is outside of the intended control sphere. This could allow an attacker to cause the product to operate on unauthorized files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6246.06\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6127.40\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 6011.7",
