The retriever results also point to the more specific, Base-level CWE-1240 as a strong candidate since the vulnerability stems from using a risky implementation of a cryptographic primitive, specifically AES in ECB mode. CWE-1240 is a child of CWE-327, indicating a hierarchical relationship where CWE-1240 is a more specific case of using a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm. The relationship informs the decision to include CWE-1240 as a secondary candidate to capture the specific implementation flaw.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe1240[\"CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\"]\n    \n    cwe1240 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe327 primary\n    class cwe1240 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with the **insecure encryption** algorithm used (AES in ECB mode), leading to the potential extraction of information from encrypted data.\n\nROOT CAUSE: **Insecure encryption** algorithm (AES in ECB mode)\nWEAKNESS: Lack of diffusion, allowing repeating byte patterns to be observed.\nIMPACT: Potential extraction of information from encrypted data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **root cause** identified in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary: the use of an **insecure encryption AES mode (Electronic Codebook, aka ECB)**. This aligns directly with CWE-327, \"Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.\" The CVE reference also mentions CWE-1240, \"Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\".\n\nThe relationship between CWE-327 and CWE-1240 is that CWE-1240 is a child of CWE-327. Given the specific details of the vulnerability, where the **root cause** is the use of ECB mode with AES, CWE-1240 provides a more precise classification of the weakness. However, since CWE-327 is a class level it will be the primary, and CWE-1240 will be a secondary candidate.\n\nThe evidence is strong, as the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the use of ECB mode, and the CVE reference summary confirms this as the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.\n\n### Extended Description\nCryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors.
