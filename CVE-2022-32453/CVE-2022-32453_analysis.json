It can precede CWE-79. CWE-74 is a class that could apply, as CWE-113 is a specific type of injection. The decision to choose CWE-113 is based on its variant-level specificity and direct relevance to HTTP header injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences (CRLF Injection)\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe436[\"CWE-436: Interpretation Conflict\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe93\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe436\n    cwe113 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe113 primary\n    class cwe93,cwe20,cwe436,cwe79,cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events includes **improper input sanitization** leading to **HTTP header injection**, which then allows a remote attacker to obtain and/or alter the data of the product. The root cause is the **improper input sanitization**, and the weakness is the **HTTP header injection**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly indicates an **HTTP header injection** vulnerability due to **improper input sanitization**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section explicitly mentions CWE-113 as a weakness: \"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting')\". This statement strongly supports the selection of CWE-113.\n\nThe relationship graph confirms that CWE-113 is a variant and is more specific than its parent classes like CWE-20, CWE-74 or CWE-93.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **HTTP header injection** vulnerability, which is a specific type of CRLF injection.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
