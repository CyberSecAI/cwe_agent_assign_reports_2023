CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE that represents exposure of sensitive information, and it's often a consequence rather than a root cause. The relationship between CWE-84 and its parent CWE-79 helps in understanding the specific type of input neutralization failure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe84[\"CWE-84: Improper Neutralization of Encoded URI Schemes in a Web Page\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe84 -->|CHILDOF| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe84 primary\n    class cwe79,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization of encoded URI schemes** (CWE-84). This leads to the ability to **read arbitrary files**, **execute arbitrary JavaScript code**, and **trigger denial of service conditions**. The **improper neutralization** is the root cause, while the file reading, code execution, and DoS are impacts.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **failure to prevent interaction with alternative URI schemes**. The primary CWE, CWE-84, aligns with this root cause, as it describes the **improper neutralization of encoded URI schemes in a web page**.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary supports this selection. The vulnerability description key phrases highlight the **weakness** as \"**does not prevent interaction with alternative URI schemes**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the **root cause** as the device's embedded browser \"**does not properly prevent interaction with alternative URI schemes**\".\n\nCWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) was considered because CWE-84 is a child of CWE-79, however the encoded URI schemes makes CWE-84 a more precise fit.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was considered because one of the impacts is the ability to \"**steal or manipulate the information on the screen**\", however, CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE that represents exposure of sensitive information, and it's often a consequence rather than a root cause.\n\nThe final selection is based on the provided evidence and the relationships between CWEs. CWE-84 is at the optimal level of specificity (Variant) and accurately represents the **improper neutralization of encoded URI schemes**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
