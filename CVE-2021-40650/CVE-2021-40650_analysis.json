This hierarchical relationship indicates that the specific issue (missing secure flag) is a specific type of cleartext transmission. The selection of CWE-614 is based on it being a more specific Variant, as recommended by CWE guidelines.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe614[\"CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe614 -->|CHILDOF| cwe319\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe614 primary\n    class cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain begins with the **weakness** of the cookie not having the secure flag set which leads to the transmission of sensitive cookie data in cleartext over HTTP and ultimately enables man-in-the-middle attacks and session hijacking.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points towards CWE-614 as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly states that a cookie is issued without the secure flag set, aligning perfectly with CWE-614's definition. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section confirms this, stating, \"the `secure` flag is not set for this cookie\" and emphasizing the risk of MitM attacks and session hijacking.\n\nThe Retriever Results reinforce this assessment, with CWE-614 being the top-ranked CWE. The mapping guidance for CWE-614 explicitly allows its usage and highlights its Variant level of abstraction as a preferred level for mapping.\n\nCWE-319 was considered as a higher-level alternative, as CWE-614 is a child of CWE-319. While CWE-319 is relevant, CWE-614 provides a more precise and descriptive classification of the vulnerability, making it the optimal choice.\n\nThe final decision is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description, confirmation from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, and reinforcement from the Retriever Results, all within the constraints and recommendations of the CWE mapping guidance.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
