The description explicitly mentions an **infinite loop** being triggered. The secondary CWE, **CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling)**, is related because the **infinite loop** leads to resource exhaustion due to memory leaks. **CWE-770** is a child of **CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption)**, illustrating a broader resource management issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe835[\"CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe835 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n    class cwe400 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a malformed streaming URL being posted, which triggers an **infinite loop**, leading to memory leaks and ultimately a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nMalformed Streaming URL -> **Infinite Loop (CWE-835)** -> Memory Leaks -> Resource Exhaustion -> Denial of Service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **CWE-835** as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of an **infinite loop** in both the vulnerability description and the CVE reference. The CVE reference links content summary states: \"The core weakness is the existence of an **infinite loop** when parsing specific types of streaming URLs within the Onebox functionality\". The description also includes \"Parsing Oneboxes in the background job trigger an **infinite loop**, which cause memory leaks.\"\n\nThe secondary weakness, **CWE-770**, was considered because the **infinite loop** leads to excessive memory allocation without limits, causing resource exhaustion. The CVE reference says, \"The system did not properly validate or limit the processing of external resources, allowing for the potential of unbounded resource consumption.\"\n\nBoth CWEs are at the Base level, which is the preferred level of abstraction for root cause analysis. **CWE-835** is the more direct cause, while **CWE-770** describes the mechanism by which the **infinite loop** leads to a DoS. The selection of **CWE-835** and **CWE-770** is based on the provided evidence and the relationships between the CWEs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*Rejected*: Although the URL could be crafted, this is not an injection vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Rejected*: There is no explicit mention of a list of disallowed inputs.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
