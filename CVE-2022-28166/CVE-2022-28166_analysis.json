CWE-327 is a Class, while CWE-1240 is a Base. Although the vulnerability description is specific to the **use of static key ciphers**, which could suggest a more specific CWE, the use of static key ciphers falls under the broader category of using risky cryptographic algorithms. CWE-757 is added because **the static key ciphers are allowed and used**, so they are being selected even if they are less secure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe1240[\"CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\"]\n    cwe757[\"CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')\"]\n    \n    cwe1240 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    cwe757 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe327 primary\n    class cwe1240,cwe757 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **implementation of a TLS/SSL server** that **allows the use of static key ciphers**.\n  - **Root Cause:** Allowing the use of static key ciphers.\n  - **Weakness:** The static key ciphers are **vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks**.\n  - **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive information due to potential decryption of communications.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the most specific CWE that accurately represents the vulnerability. The primary evidence comes from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" which highlights the **weakness** as the **use of static key ciphers**, and from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which states that \"the vulnerability stems from the implementation of TLS/SSL server in Brocade SANnav which supports the use of static key ciphers\".\n\nCWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) is selected as the primary CWE because the **use of static key ciphers** directly aligns with the description of using a risky cryptographic algorithm. While a more specific CWE could potentially exist, CWE-327 provides a suitable level of abstraction for this vulnerability. CWE-1240 (Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation) is included as static key ciphers are a risky implementation of cryptographic primitives. The inclusion of CWE-757 (Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')) acknowledges that the system allows and selects **static key ciphers** even though they are less secure.\n\nThe confidence score is high (0.8) due to the clear evidence in the vulnerability description and the alignment with the CWE descriptions.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n\n### Technical Explanation for CWE-327:\nThe Brocade SANnav implementation of TLS/SSL supports **static key ciphers**, which are considered risky cryptographic algorithms. This aligns directly with CWE-327's description: \"The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.\"\n### Security Implications:\nThe use of **static key ciphers** allows attackers to potentially eavesdrop on communications, as the same key is used for all sessions. If the key is compromised, all past and future communications can be decrypted.\n### Relationship and Chain Patterns:\nCWE-327 is a Class-level CWE. It is related to CWE-1240, which is a more specific Base-level CWE describing the use of a risky implementation.\n### Mapping Guidance Influence:\nThe mapping guidance suggests that CWE-327 might have more specific children. While this is true, CWE-327 adequately captures the essence of the vulnerability, making it a suitable primary CWE.\n### Additional Notes:\nCWE-327 is slated for extensive research and analysis to improve terminology and relationships, indicating its importance in cryptographic vulnerabilities.\n\n### Technical Explanation for CWE-1240:\nThe Brocade SANnav implementation uses static key ciphers, which are a risky implementation of cryptographic primitives within the TLS/SSL protocol.\n### Security Implications:\nCompromising the static key allows decryption of all communications using that key.\n### Relationship and Chain Patterns:\nCWE-1240 is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-327.\n### Mapping Guidance Influence:\nThe mapping guidance recommends using the Base level of abstraction, which is appropriate for CWE-1240.\n### Additional Notes:\nThe terminology notes highlight the importance of consistent and accurate terminology in cryptography-related CWEs.\n\n### Technical Explanation for CWE-757:\nThe Brocade SANnav implementation allows negotiation of cryptographic algorithms, and it doesn't prevent the selection of less-secure **static key ciphers**.\n### Security Implications:\nAttackers could potentially force the system to use less secure algorithms, making it easier to compromise communications.\n### Relationship and Chain Patterns:\nCWE-757 is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-693.\n### Mapping Guidance Influence:\nThe mapping guidance recommends using the Base level of abstraction, which is appropriate for CWE-757.\n### Additional Notes:\nThis CWE is related to CWE-300, as it involves a downgrade attack, but CWE-757 is more specific to algorithm selection.\n\n### Other CWEs Considered but Not Used:\n- **CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key):** This CWE was considered but not used because the vulnerability is not necessarily about a hard-coded key, but rather the use of static key ciphers, which are weak regardless of whether they are hard-coded.\n- **CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values):** This CWE was considered but not used because the randomness of key generation is not the primary issue; the inherent weakness of static key ciphers is the main concern.\n- **CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials):** Similar to CWE-321, this is not about hard-coded credentials in general, but the specific use of static key ciphers.\n- **CWE-1204 (Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)):** Although IVs are related to ciphers, the core issue is the use of static keys rather than weak IV generation.",
