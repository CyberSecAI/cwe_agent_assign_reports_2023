# Analysis for CVE-2021-20046

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 1.0 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.5 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-121, which is a variant of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). The relationship shows a clear path from a general memory safety issue (CWE-119) to a more specific type of buffer overflow that occurs on the stack (CWE-121). The Variant level of CWE-121 is preferred due to its specificity.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **stack-based buffer overflow** (CWE-121) due to **improper** handling of the HTTP Content-Length response header. A remote authenticated attacker can exploit this to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) and potentially achieve code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis strongly supports CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) as the primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions "Stack-based buffer overflow" as the **root cause**. This aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-121, which is a variant specifying where the buffer overflow occurs, which is on the stack.

The evidence is:
*   "A **Stack-based buffer overflow** in the SonicOS HTTP Content-Length response header allows a remote authenticated attacker to cause Denial of Service (DoS) and potentially results in code execution in the firewall."

CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) was considered because it is a parent of CWE-121. However, CWE-121 provides more specific information about the location of the buffer, therefore is a better fit.

## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense
[Not Used] While a length value might be involved, the description does not explicitly state that an incorrect length value is the direct cause of the overflow.

## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense
[Not Used] Integer underflow is not mentioned or implied in the vulnerability description.
