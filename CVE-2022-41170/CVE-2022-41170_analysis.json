CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is also considered as a secondary issue that could result from the initial memory mismanagement. These CWEs are related to memory corruption.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe825 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe416 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n    class cwe825,cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **lack of proper memory management**, leading to either a **stack-based overflow or a re-use of a dangling pointer**. The \"re-use of a dangling pointer\" directly maps to CWE-416 (Use After Free). The \"stack-based overflow\" can lead to CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write). The final impact is Remote Code Execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the primary CWE match was suggested as CWE-119, but the description provides more specific details allowing for better mappings. The key phrases indicate a **lack of proper memory management** which can lead to **stack-based overflow or a re-use of dangling pointer**. The \"re-use of dangling pointer\" directly corresponds to CWE-416 (Use After Free). The description explicitly mentions \"dangling pointer,\" which is an alternative term for CWE-416. CWE-416 is a variant and is allowed according to the mapping guidance. It is also a preferred level of abstraction.\n\nThe \"stack-based overflow\" part of the vulnerability description may lead to CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write).\n\nThe provided evidence indicates that the vulnerability involves memory corruption due to improper handling of memory resources.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n*This was not selected because the description does not indicate an excessive size value, but rather a more general memory management issue.*\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n*This was not selected because the vulnerability description doesn't discuss about information leakage from resources that are not cleared before reuse.*\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n*This was not selected because this is a class-level CWE, and more specific variants such as CWE-416 are available.*\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n*This was not selected because the description does not indicate that the size calculation of the buffer is incorrect*\n\n## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.\n\n*This was not selected because the description does not discuss the allocation of memory for groups of objects.*\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n*This was not selected because there is no mention of integer underflow.*\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n*This was not selected because the description does not indicate locking issues.*\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n*This was not selected because there is no evidence of out-of-bounds read from the description.*\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary.
