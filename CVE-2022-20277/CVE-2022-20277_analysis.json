This parent-child relationship indicates that CWE-203 is a more specific form of information exposure. The Retriever Results also supports this, showing both CWEs as relevant. Because the vulnerability specifically involves a side channel **information disclosure** based on observable differences in behavior, CWE-203 is the more appropriate, specific choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe203[\"CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe203 -- CHILDOF --> cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe203 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **side channel information disclosure** in the DevicePolicyManager, which allows an attacker to determine whether an app is installed. The **root cause** is an observable discrepancy in the behavior of the DevicePolicyManager that reveals sensitive information. This leads to the **impact** of local information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability description highlights \"side channel **information disclosure**\" in DevicePolicyManager, leading to the ability to determine app installation status without proper permissions. This points to an **information disclosure** vulnerability.\n\nThe Retriever Results and \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" both suggest CWE-203 \"Observable Discrepancy\" and CWE-200 \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\" as potential matches. Given the evidence for the side channel attack and the fact that side channel attacks are rooted in observable discrepancies, CWE-203 is chosen as the primary CWE.\n\nCWE-200 is also considered but is deemed less specific. While the vulnerability ultimately leads to **information disclosure**, the immediate cause is the observable discrepancy, making CWE-203 more accurate. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-200 advises against its general use for any loss of confidentiality and recommends more specific CWEs when applicable.\n\nTherefore, CWE-203 is the most appropriate CWE because it directly captures the **root cause** of the vulnerability: an observable discrepancy leading to **information disclosure**. The selection is supported by the vulnerability description's emphasis on side channels and the relationship between CWE-203 and CWE-200.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
