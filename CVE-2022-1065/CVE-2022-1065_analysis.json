CWE-1390 is a Class level CWE and parent of CWE-603, representing a broader category of authentication issues. CWE-287 is also a Class level CWE and a parent of CWE-1390. The relationship shows a hierarchy from general authentication failures (CWE-287) to weak authentication mechanisms (CWE-1390) to the specific flaw of client-side authentication (CWE-603).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe603[\"CWE-603: Use of Client-Side Authentication\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe603 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe1390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe603 primary\n    class cwe1390,cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **flawed authentication process** in Abacus ERP. The core issue is the **lack of backend validation** for multi-factor authentication (MFA), relying solely on the frontend. This leads to the **MFA bypass**, granting **unauthorized access** to attackers with valid credentials.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-603 (Use of Client-Side Authentication). This is because the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly state that the MFA verification is only performed on the frontend and not on the backend. This aligns perfectly with the CWE-603 description, which states that the server-side authentication can be bypassed if the authentication is only performed on the client-side.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision is:\n- \"The vulnerability lies in the authentication process of Abacus ERP software, specifically in how multi-factor authentication (MFA) is handled. The backend does not validate the MFA status, relying solely on the frontend.\" (CVE Reference Links Content Summary)\n- \"Frontend validation: The verification of the MFA request is only performed on the frontend of the application and not on the backend.\" (CVE Reference Links Content Summary)\n\nCWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) were also considered, but were deemed less specific than CWE-603. While the authentication process is indeed flawed and weak, the root cause is the reliance on client-side authentication, which CWE-603 captures directly. Also, the Mapping Guidance for CWE-287 suggests using its children such as CWE-1390.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) as it accurately represents the weakness without being overly generic (Class) or overly specific (Variant).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-603: Use of Client-Side Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA client/server product performs authentication within client code but not in server code, allowing server-side authentication to be bypassed via a modified client that omits the authentication check.\n\n### Extended Description\nClient-side authentication is extremely weak and may be breached easily. Any attacker may read the source code and reverse-engineer the authentication mechanism to access parts of the application which would otherwise be protected.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\nChildOf -> CWE-602\nPeerOf -> CWE-300\nPeerOf -> CWE-656\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
