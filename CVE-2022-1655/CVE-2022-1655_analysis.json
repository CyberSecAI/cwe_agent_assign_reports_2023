While the root cause is an **incorrect permission assignment for a critical resource**, the specific manifestation is the absence of the HttpOnly flag on a sensitive cookie.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1004[\"CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe1004 -->|CHILDOF| cwe732\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1004 primary\n    class cwe732 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe668 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Incorrect permission assignment for critical resource**: Horizon session cookies are created without the HttpOnly flag.\n2.  **Impact**: Loss of confidentiality and integrity due to potential XSS attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, I considered CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) because the vulnerability description mentions an \"**incorrect permission assignment for critical resource**\". However, the retriever results and the specific details of the vulnerability strongly point to CWE-1004 (Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag).\n\nThe description explicitly states that \"Horizon session cookies are created without the HttpOnly flag.\" This directly matches the definition of CWE-1004, which is a Variant-level CWE, making it more specific and appropriate than the Class-level CWE-732.\n\nWhile the root cause might be related to an **incorrect permission assignment**, the more precise weakness is the missing HttpOnly flag. Therefore, I've chosen CWE-1004 as the primary CWE.\n\nCWE-732 remains a secondary candidate, as it represents a higher-level categorization of the same underlying issue.\n\nThe choice of CWE-1004 is based on the following evidence:\n*   Vulnerability Description: \"Horizon session cookies are created without the HttpOnly flag...\"\n*   Retriever Results: CWE-1004 is the top match based on sparse retriever.\n*   CWE Specifications: The description of CWE-1004 aligns perfectly with the vulnerability details.\n*   CWE Mapping Guidance: Usage: ALLOWED for CWE-1004\n\nI am reasonably confident (Confidence Score: 0.8) in this assessment, given the evidence provided in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
