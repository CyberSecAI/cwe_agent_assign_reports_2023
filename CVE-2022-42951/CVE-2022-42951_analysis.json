It has a parent-child relationship with CWE-1391 (Class). CWE-306 (Base) was considered as a secondary CWE. It is a child of CWE-287 (Class). Choosing CWE-1392 provides more specificity, as the vulnerability stems from the use of default credentials rather than a general lack of authentication.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1392[\"CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe1392 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1391\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1392 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of access control** during the initial startup phase of a Couchbase Server node. This leads to the **use of default credentials**, allowing an attacker to connect to the cluster manager. The impact is that the attacker can execute arbitrary code remotely.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points towards **CWE-1392 (Use of Default Credentials)** as the primary weakness. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly states the root cause: \"Couchbase Cluster Manager **lacks access controls** during a cluster node restart... the security cookie is set to \"nocookie\" which **lacks access controls** over the Erlang distribution protocol.\" This allows an attacker to \"connect to the cluster manager **using default credentials**\" (from the Vulnerability Description).\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-1392 as the top match.\n\nWhile **CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function)** is also a reasonable candidate, **CWE-1392** is a more precise characterization of the vulnerability, as the issue isn't the complete absence of authentication, but rather the exploitation of default credentials during a specific time window.\n\nTherefore, the final decision is to classify this vulnerability as **CWE-1392 (Use of Default Credentials)** as the primary CWE, with **CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function)** as a secondary candidate. This selection is based on the evidence provided, the retriever results, and the relationship analysis, which indicates that **CWE-1392** is the more specific and appropriate choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n* CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\n* CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function",
