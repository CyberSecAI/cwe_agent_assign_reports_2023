CWE-259 [Use of Hard-coded Password] is a variant of CWE-798, providing a more specific classification if the hardcoded credential is a password. CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function] could also be considered if the hardcoded credential is the *only* authentication mechanism, effectively resulting in a missing authentication. The choice of CWE-798 as primary is due to the broader scope encompassing any hardcoded credential, with CWE-259 considered as a more specific variant.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe1391 -->|PARENTOF| cwe798\n    cwe306 -->|PEEROF| cwe798\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe798 primary\n    class cwe259,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **hardcoded credential** (CWE-798 or CWE-259), leading to an **authentication bypass** (CWE-306 if authentication is completely missing due to the hardcoded credential being the only check). The final impact is unauthorized access to sensitive functionality.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary. The key evidence is the statement that the web interface uses a **hardcoded HTTP header** for authentication, leading to an **authentication bypass**.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-798 [Use of Hard-coded Credentials] is a parent to more specific CWEs like CWE-259 [Use of Hard-coded Password], which are considered when the hardcoded credential is, in fact, a password. CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function] is considered a peer of CWE-798, and is a potential mapping if the reliance on the hardcoded credential is the *only* authentication mechanism.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-798 is chosen as the primary because it directly reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability which is the **use of hard-coded credentials**. If the **hard-coded credential** is a password, CWE-259 [Use of Hard-coded Password] would be a more specific variant.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*Not selected*: Injection is not the **root cause** here.
