# Analysis for CVE-2022-31765

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-269 | Improper Privilege Management | 0.5 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |
| CWE-639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | 0.4 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-862 **Missing Authorization**, is a child of the class CWE-285 **Improper Authorization**. CWE-269 **Improper Privilege Management** is a class level CWE, making it less specific than CWE-862. CWE-639 **Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key** represents a specific method of authorization bypass, which is less directly applicable than the general lack of authorization. The relationships guided the selection of the most specific and relevant CWE.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check for the change password function. This **weakness** allows a low-privileged user to then escalate their privileges and gain unauthorized control of the device.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on the provided evidence which strongly indicates a **missing authorization** check. The vulnerability description states that the affected devices "**do not properly authorize the change password function**." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly states, "The affected products **do not properly authorize the change password function** of the web interface" and identifies "Missing authorization (CWE-862)" as a **weakness**. This direct evidence supports the selection of CWE-862. The retriever results also list several authorization-related CWEs, further solidifying the choice. CWE-862 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred, and the mapping guidance allows its use. The final selection is primarily based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and CVE summary.

CWE-269 was considered because the impact of the vulnerability is privilege escalation. However, CWE-269 is a Class-level CWE and its mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available. Since the root cause is **missing authorization**, CWE-862 is a more accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability.

CWE-639 was considered because it involves authorization bypass. However, the vulnerability description focuses on the **lack of authorization** rather than a bypass of existing authorization. Therefore, CWE-862 is the more appropriate choice.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 5051.09
