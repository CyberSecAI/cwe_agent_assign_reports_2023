The vulnerability involves a **man-in-the-middle attack** where an attacker injects SQL queries. CWE-300 is related to CWE-923 (Improper Isolation of System Resources). While CWE-300 is generally discouraged, its alternative terms, especially \"Man-in-the-Middle / MITM,\" directly align with the vulnerability description.\n\nSecondary CWEs include CWE-89 and CWE-319. CWE-89 represents the **SQL Injection** vulnerability resulting from the injected queries. CWE-319, Cleartext Transmission, is also relevant since the injected SQL commands are processed before the connection is fully secured.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe300[\"CWE-300: Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint\"]\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe923[\"CWE-923: Improper Isolation of System Resources\"]\n    \n    cwe300 -->|CHILDOF| cwe923\n    cwe89 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe300\n    cwe319 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe300\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe300 primary\n    class cwe89,cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **man-in-the-middle attack** (CWE-300), leading to the injection of arbitrary SQL queries. The server processes these unencrypted bytes (CWE-319), resulting in **SQL Injection** (CWE-89).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the vulnerability description indicating a **man-in-the-middle attack** that allowed injecting SQL queries. This aligned well with CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint). However, CWE-300 is generally discouraged due to frequent misuse.\n\nThe analysis then considered the retriever results and the CVE description's emphasis on **SQL Injection** and unencrypted data processing. This led to the inclusion of CWE-89 and CWE-319 as secondary CWEs.\n\nThe selection of CWE-300 is based on the vulnerability being a **man-in-the-middle attack**, as stated in the vulnerability description. The \"Alternative Terms\" section of CWE-300 lists \"Man-in-the-Middle / MITM\", further strengthening the mapping.\n\nThe supporting evidence is: \"When PgBouncer is configured to use cert authentication, a **man-in-the-middle attack**er can inject arbitrary SQL queries when a connection is first established, despite the use of TLS certificate verification and encryption.\"\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they represent the root cause (MitM attack) and the immediate consequences (**SQL Injection**, unencrypted transmission) of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not selected:* This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability does not involve weak credentials.
