## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-300, which is a Class-level weakness describing a communication channel accessible by a non-endpoint. The vulnerability involves a **man-in-the-middle attack** where an attacker injects SQL queries. CWE-300 is related to CWE-923 (Improper Isolation of System Resources). While CWE-300 is generally discouraged, its alternative terms, especially "Man-in-the-Middle / MITM," directly align with the vulnerability description.

Secondary CWEs include CWE-89 and CWE-319. CWE-89 represents the **SQL Injection** vulnerability resulting from the injected queries. CWE-319, Cleartext Transmission, is also relevant since the injected SQL commands are processed before the connection is fully secured.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **man-in-the-middle attack** (CWE-300), leading to the injection of arbitrary SQL queries. The server processes these unencrypted bytes (CWE-319), resulting in **SQL Injection** (CWE-89).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on the vulnerability description indicating a **man-in-the-middle attack** that allowed injecting SQL queries. This aligned well with CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint). However, CWE-300 is generally discouraged due to frequent misuse.

The analysis then considered the retriever results and the CVE description's emphasis on **SQL Injection** and unencrypted data processing. This led to the inclusion of CWE-89 and CWE-319 as secondary CWEs.

The selection of CWE-300 is based on the vulnerability being a **man-in-the-middle attack**, as stated in the vulnerability description. The "Alternative Terms" section of CWE-300 lists "Man-in-the-Middle / MITM", further strengthening the mapping.

The supporting evidence is: "When PgBouncer is configured to use cert authentication, a **man-in-the-middle attack**er can inject arbitrary SQL queries when a connection is first established, despite the use of TLS certificate verification and encryption."

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they represent the root cause (MitM attack) and the immediate consequences (**SQL Injection**, unencrypted transmission) of the vulnerability.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-3935

## Vulnerability Description
When PgBouncer is configured to use cert authentication, a **man-in-the-middle attack**er can inject arbitrary SQL queries when a connection is first established, despite the use of TLS certificate verification and encryption. This flaw affects PgBouncer versions prior to 1.16.1.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **man-in-the-middle attack**
- **impact:** execute arbitrary SQL queries
- **attacker:** man-in-the-middle attacker
- **product:** PgBouncer
- **version:** prior to 1.16.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-3935:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

-   The vulnerability stems from PgBouncer's handling of the initial connection phase when using "cert" authentication. Specifically, it does not properly discard or ignore extraneous data after the TLS handshake is complete.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** A MitM attacker can inject arbitrary data into the TCP stream after a TLS handshake when using certificate-based authentication.
-   **Unencrypted Data Processing:** PgBouncer server processes unencrypted bytes injected by the attacker even after a TLS connection is established. This is the core weakness, as the data is treated as part of the initial connection setup.
-   **SQL Injection:** The injected data is interpreted as SQL commands, effectively allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database server.
-   **Bypass TLS Encryption:**  Although TLS encryption and certificate verification is used, this vulnerability bypasses the security measures taken by TLS as the arbitrary commands injected are processed before the connection is fully secured.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Arbitrary SQL Injection:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary SQL queries on the PostgreSQL database, which can lead to:
    -   Data breaches (reading sensitive data).
    -   Data manipulation (modifying/deleting data).
    -   Denial of service (impacting availability).
    -   Full database compromise, potentially leading to further system compromises.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Man-in-the-Middle Position:** The attacker must be in a MitM position between the client and the PgBouncer server.
-   **TCP Connection Interception:**  The attacker must be able to intercept and modify the TCP stream during the initial connection handshake.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the network path between the client and the PgBouncer server.
-   **MitM Capability:** The attacker needs to be capable of intercepting and modifying network traffic.
-   **Timing:** The attack takes place during the initial connection negotiation process, right after the TLS handshake.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The vulnerability only applies when PgBouncer is configured to use "cert" authentication.
-   The injected SQL commands are only effective if PgBouncer does not require any authentication data after the TLS handshake. A setup relying on SSL certificate authentication might bypass this.
-   The fix for this vulnerability involves making PgBouncer reject extraneous data after the SSL or GSS encryption handshake.

This vulnerability is considered high severity because it allows a complete bypass of security measures meant to secure the connection leading to arbitrary SQL injection, thus a complete data breach if the attacker is successful.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-300: Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not adequately verify the identity of actors at both ends of a communication channel, or does not adequately ensure the integrity of the channel, in a way that allows the channel to be accessed or influenced by an actor that is not an endpoint.

### Extended Description
In order to establish secure communication between two parties, it is often important to adequately verify the identity of entities at each end of the communication channel. Inadequate or inconsistent verification may result in insufficient or incorrect identification of either communicating entity. This can have negative consequences such as misplaced trust in the entity at the other end of the channel. An attacker can leverage this by interposing between the communicating entities and masquerading as the original entity. In the absence of sufficient verification of identity, such an attacker can eavesdrop and potentially modify the communication between the original entities.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-923

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-300 is commonly misused for vulnerabilities in which the prerequisites for exploitation require the adversary to be in a privileged "in-the-middle" position.
**Comments:** Consider root-cause weaknesses that allow adversary-in-the-middle attacks to happen, such as CWEs involving poor integrity protection.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The summary identifies multiple distinct possibilities, suggesting that this is a category that must be broken into more specific weaknesses.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2014-1266:** chain: incorrect "goto" in Apple SSL product bypasses certificate validation, allowing Adversry-in-the-Middle (AITM) attack (Apple "goto fail" bug). CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).




## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.

### Extended Description
When a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by interfering in the communication path between the host and client. The product might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the product might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host.

### Alternative Terms

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-12496:** A Go framework for robotics, drones, and IoT devices skips verification of root CA certificates by default.
- **CVE-2014-1266:** chain: incorrect "goto" in Apple SSL product bypasses certificate validation, allowing Adversary-in-the-Middle (AITM) attack (Apple "goto fail" bug). CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).
- **CVE-2021-22909:** Chain: router's firmware update procedure uses curl with "-k" (insecure) option that disables certificate validation (CWE-295), allowing adversary-in-the-middle (AITM) compromise with a malicious firmware image (CWE-494).




## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.


Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.


When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to "sniff" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29519:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends sensitive information in plaintext, including passwords and session tokens.
- **CVE-2022-30312:** Building Controller uses a protocol that transmits authentication credentials in plaintext.
- **CVE-2022-31204:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends password in plaintext.




## CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
A protocol or its implementation supports interaction between multiple actors and allows those actors to negotiate which algorithm should be used as a protection mechanism such as encryption or authentication, but it does not select the strongest algorithm that is available to both parties.

### Extended Description
When a security mechanism can be forced to downgrade to use a less secure algorithm, this can make it easier for attackers to compromise the product by exploiting weaker algorithm. The victim might not be aware that the less secure algorithm is being used. For example, if an attacker can force a communications channel to use cleartext instead of strongly-encrypted data, then the attacker could read the channel by sniffing, instead of going through extra effort of trying to decrypt the data using brute force techniques.

### Alternative Terms

**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is related to CWE-300, although not all downgrade attacks necessarily require an entity that redirects or interferes with the network. See examples.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2006-4302:** Attacker can select an older version of the software to exploit its vulnerabilities.
- **CVE-2006-4407:** Improper prioritization of encryption ciphers during negotiation leads to use of a weaker cipher.
- **CVE-2005-2969:** chain: SSL/TLS implementation disables a verification step (CWE-325) that enables a downgrade attack to a weaker protocol.




## CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product communicates with a host that provides a certificate, but the product does not properly ensure that the certificate is actually associated with that host.

### Extended Description


Even if a certificate is well-formed, signed, and follows the chain of trust, it may simply be a valid certificate for a different site than the site that the product is interacting with. If the certificate's host-specific data is not properly checked - such as the Common Name (CN) in the Subject or the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension of an X.509 certificate - it may be possible for a redirection or spoofing attack to allow a malicious host with a valid certificate to provide data, impersonating a trusted host. In order to ensure data integrity, the certificate must be valid and it must pertain to the site that is being accessed.


Even if the product attempts to check the hostname, it is still possible to incorrectly check the hostname. For example, attackers could create a certificate with a name that begins with a trusted name followed by a NUL byte, which could cause some string-based comparisons to only examine the portion that contains the trusted name.


This weakness can occur even when the product uses Certificate Pinning, if the product does not verify the hostname at the time a certificate is pinned.

- **CVE-2021-3011:** virtual interrupt controller in a virtualization product allows crash of host by writing a certain invalid value to a register, which triggers a fatal error instead of returning an error code




## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.

### Extended Description


Cryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.


It is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.


Since the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered "unsafe" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.


For a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.
