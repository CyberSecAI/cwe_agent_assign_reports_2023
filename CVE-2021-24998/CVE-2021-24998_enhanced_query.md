# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

### Extended Description
When product generates predictable values in a context requiring unpredictability, it may be possible for an attacker to guess the next value that will be generated, and use this guess to impersonate another user or access sensitive information.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-693
CanPrecede -> CWE-804

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be primary to many other weaknesses such as cryptographic errors, authentication errors, symlink following, information leaks, and others.

**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.3, CWE-330 and its descendants are being investigated by the CWE crypto team to identify gaps related to randomness and unpredictability, as well as the relationships between randomness and cryptographic primitives. This "subtree analysis" might result in the addition or deprecation of existing entries; the reorganization of relationships in some views, e.g. the research view (CWE-1000); more consistent use of terminology; and/or significant modifications to related entries.

**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, "randomness" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-3692:** PHP framework uses mt_rand() function (Marsenne Twister) when generating tokens
- **CVE-2020-7010:** Cloud application on Kubernetes generates passwords using a weak random number generator based on deployment time.
- **CVE-2009-3278:** Crypto product uses rand() library function to generate a recovery key, making it easier to conduct brute force attacks.




## CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) in a security context, but the PRNG's algorithm is not cryptographically strong.

### Extended Description


When a non-cryptographic PRNG is used in a cryptographic context, it can expose the cryptography to certain types of attacks.


Often a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is not designed for cryptography. Sometimes a mediocre source of randomness is sufficient or preferable for algorithms that use random numbers. Weak generators generally take less processing power and/or do not use the precious, finite, entropy sources on a system. While such PRNGs might have very useful features, these same features could be used to break the cryptography.

## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

### Extended Description


Attackers may be able to bypass weak authentication faster and/or with less effort than expected.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).
- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
- **CVE-2021-3116:** Chain: Python-based HTTP Proxy server uses the wrong boolean operators (CWE-480) causing an incorrect comparison (CWE-697) that identifies an authN failure if all three conditions are met instead of only one, allowing bypass of the proxy authentication (CWE-1390)




## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction:** Compound
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

### Extended Description
When a web server is designed to receive a request from a client without any mechanism for verifying that it was intentionally sent, then it might be possible for an attacker to trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server which will be treated as an authentic request. This can be done via a URL, image load, XMLHttpRequest, etc. and can result in exposure of data or unintended code execution.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.
**Comments:** While attack-oriented composites are supported in CWE, they have not been a focus of research. There is a chance that future research or CWE scope clarifications will change or deprecate them. Perform root-cause analysis to determine if other weaknesses allow CSRF attacks to occur, and map to those weaknesses. For example, predictable CSRF tokens might allow bypass of CSRF protection mechanisms; if this occurs, they might be better characterized as randomness/predictability weaknesses.
**Reasons:**
- Other


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

There can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.


**[Theoretical]** 

The CSRF topology is multi-channel:


  - Attacker (as outsider) to intermediary (as user). The interaction point is either an external or internal channel.

  - Intermediary (as user) to server (as victim). The activation point is an internal channel.





### Observed Examples

- **CVE-2004-1995:** Add user accounts via a URL in an img tag
- **CVE-2004-1967:** Arbitrary code execution by specifying the code in a crafted img tag or URL




## CWE-760: Use of a One-Way Hash with a Predictable Salt
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a one-way cryptographic hash against an input that should not be reversible, such as a password, but the product uses a predictable salt as part of the input.

### Extended Description


This makes it easier for attackers to pre-compute the hash value using dictionary attack techniques such as rainbow tables, effectively disabling the protection that an unpredictable salt would provide.


It should be noted that, despite common perceptions, the use of a good salt with a hash does not sufficiently increase the effort for an attacker who is targeting an individual password, or who has a large amount of computing resources available, such as with cloud-based services or specialized, inexpensive hardware. Offline password cracking can still be effective if the hash function is not expensive to compute; many cryptographic functions are designed to be efficient and can be vulnerable to attacks using massive computing resources, even if the hash is cryptographically strong. The use of a salt only slightly increases the computing requirements for an attacker compared to other strategies such as adaptive hash functions. See CWE-916 for more details.

- **CVE-2002-1657:** Database server uses the username for a salt when encrypting passwords, simplifying brute force attacks.
- **CVE-2001-0967:** Server uses a constant salt when encrypting passwords, simplifying brute force attacks.




## CWE-804: Guessable CAPTCHA
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a CAPTCHA challenge, but the challenge can be guessed or automatically recognized by a non-human actor.

### Extended Description


An automated attacker could bypass the intended protection of the CAPTCHA challenge and perform actions at a higher frequency than humanly possible, such as launching spam attacks.


There can be several different causes of a guessable CAPTCHA:


  - An audio or visual image that does not have sufficient distortion from the unobfuscated source image.

  - A question is generated with a format that can be automatically recognized, such as a math question.

  - A question for which the number of possible answers is limited, such as birth years or favorite sports teams.

  - A general-knowledge or trivia question for which the answer can be accessed using a data base, such as country capitals or popular entertainers.

  - Other data associated with the CAPTCHA may provide hints about its contents, such as an image whose filename contains the word that is used in the CAPTCHA.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

### Extended Description


By design, authentication protocols try to ensure that attackers must perform brute force attacks if they do not know the credentials such as a key or password. However, when these credentials are easily predictable or even fixed (as with default or hard-coded passwords and keys), then the attacker can defeat the mechanism without relying on brute force.


Credentials may be weak for different reasons, such as:


  - Hard-coded (i.e., static and unchangeable by the administrator)

  - Default (i.e., the same static value across different deployments/installations, but able to be changed by the administrator)

  - Predictable (i.e., generated in a way that produces unique credentials across deployments/installations, but can still be guessed with reasonable efficiency)

Even if a new, unique credential is intended to be generated for each product installation, if the generation is predictable, then that may also simplify guessing attacks.

- **CVE-1999-0074:** Listening TCP ports are sequentially allocated, allowing spoofing attacks.




## CWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a cryptographic primitive that uses an Initialization
			Vector (IV), but the product does not generate IVs that are
			sufficiently unpredictable or unique according to the expected
			cryptographic requirements for that primitive.
			

### Extended Description
By design, some cryptographic primitives (such as block ciphers) require that IVs must have certain properties for the uniqueness and/or unpredictability of an IV. Primitives may vary in how important these properties are. If these properties are not maintained, e.g. by a bug in the code, then the cryptography may be weakened or broken by attacking the IVs themselves.
