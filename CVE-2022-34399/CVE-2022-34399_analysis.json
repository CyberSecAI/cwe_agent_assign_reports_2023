The vulnerability description states that a malicious user with admin privileges can send input larger than expected to **leak certain sections of SMRAM**.\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the root cause is a **buffer access vulnerability** due to insufficient input validation. The impact is information disclosure.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read), which accurately captures the out-of-bounds read condition caused by sending an input larger than expected. The description of CWE-126 states: \"The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\" This perfectly matches the vulnerability where the BIOS reads beyond the intended buffer, leading to information leakage.\n\nCWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is a secondary CWE because the vulnerability is triggered by sending input larger than expected and the BIOS **does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties**.\n\nCWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) was considered, but it is too high-level and discouraged by MITRE when more specific CWEs are available. Both CWE-126 and CWE-1284 offer more specific classifications.\n\nCWE-805 (Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value) was considered. The vulnerability occurs when the input is larger than expected. This can lead to the program reading past the end of a buffer. However, CWE-126 is more precise and accurately describes the **buffer over-read** condition.\n\nCWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is a parent of CWE-126, but CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read) is a more specific variant.\n\nBased on the vulnerability description and the supporting evidence, CWE-126 and CWE-1284 are the most appropriate CWEs for this vulnerability.",
