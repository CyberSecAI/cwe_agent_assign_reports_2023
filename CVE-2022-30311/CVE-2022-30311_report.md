# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2022-30311

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is that CWE-78 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')] is a child of CWE-77 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')] and CWE-74 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')]. CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization] is a class-level CWE and might have more specific base-level children. It's also related to CWE-285 [Improper Authorization] and CWE-284 [Improper Access Control]. The vulnerability is primarily an OS command injection issue (CWE-78) due to **improper neutralization** of elements in a command, combined with **improper access control**.

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control** combined with a **command injection** weakness. The lack of proper input validation on the port syntax within the cecc-x-refresh-request HTTP endpoint allows an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands. This leads to unauthorized execution of system commands with root privileges.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis indicates a primary weakness of CWE-78 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')] and a secondary weakness of CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization].

The vulnerability description explicitly states that the issue can result in unauthorized execution of system commands with root privileges due to **improper access control** and **command injection**. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms that the vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation, allowing **command injection** and highlighting the presence of **improper access control**, specifically an incorrect authorization mechanism. This evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-78 as the primary weakness because the root cause is the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an OS command.

CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization] is chosen as a secondary weakness because the description mentions "**improper access control**", suggesting that the authorization checks are not correctly implemented.

The Retriever Results also support this conclusion, listing CWE-78 as the top candidate with a high score. The mapping guidance for CWE-78 allows its usage at the Base level of abstraction.

The final decision is based on the provided evidence, relationship analysis, and mapping guidance. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, representing both the technical flaw (CWE-78) and the related security control issue (CWE-863).

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.

*Rationale for not selecting:* This is not about the software having insufficient privileges.

## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Rationale for not selecting:* This is not directly related to a lack of isolation.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Rationale for not selecting:* The primary issue is the **command injection**, not the reliance on the input for a security decision.

## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Rationale for not selecting:* This is not about the software having insufficient privileges.

## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Rationale for not selecting:* While there is improper access control, it's more of a failure to check authorization.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

*Rationale for not selecting:* CWE-78 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')] is a better match since this is OS Command Injection.

## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. However, classification research is limited for weaknesses of this type, so there can be gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE that force use of this weakness, even at such a high level of abstraction.

*Rationale for not selecting:* This is too high-level.

## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage:
