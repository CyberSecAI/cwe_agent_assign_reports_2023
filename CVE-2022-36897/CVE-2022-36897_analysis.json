Its parents are CWE-285 and CWE-284, both related to improper authorization. Since the vulnerability description explicitly states a **missing permission check**, which falls under the umbrella of authorization, CWE-862 is a good fit. However, due to its Class level, there may be more specific Base-level CWEs. Since the vulnerability resulted in the exposure of sensitive information, CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information is also being considered.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe200 -->|RELATED| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing permission check** (CWE-862), which leads to the enumeration of hosts, ports, and credential IDs. This information exposure can then be exploited to compromise credentials.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description and retriever results, points to CWE-862 as the primary weakness due to the **missing permission check**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating the **root cause** as the plugin not performing permission checks and the **weakness** as **missing authorization** checks, leading to information disclosure. The vulnerability description key phrases also highlight the **missing permission check**.\n\nWhile CWE-862 is a Class-level CWE, the evidence strongly supports it as the **root cause**. The retriever results also suggest CWE-200, as the **missing authorization** ultimately leads to information exposure.\n\nThe final decision is to map the vulnerability to CWE-862 primarily, as it directly reflects the **missing permission check**. CWE-200 is added as a secondary weakness because the **missing authorization** leads to the exposure of sensitive information (hosts, ports, credentials). This mapping provides a more complete picture of the vulnerability. Both are at appropriate levels of specificity given the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
