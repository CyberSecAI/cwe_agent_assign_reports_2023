The Retriever results did not include a Base or Variant alternative. CWE-862 is the parent of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). Given the specific context of the vulnerability, it might be possible to narrow the focus further but with the information provided, CWE-862 is the best fit. CWE-925 (Improper Verification of Intent by Broadcast Receiver) is a Variant and a child of CWE-940 (Improper Verification of Source Attribute in a Data Structure). It is being considered due to the vulnerability description referencing a broadcast receiver.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe925[\"CWE-925: Improper Verification of Intent by Broadcast Receiver\"]\n    cwe940[\"CWE-940: Improper Verification of Source Attribute in a Data Structure\"]\n\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    cwe284 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    cwe925 -->|CHILDOF| cwe940\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe925 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284,cwe940 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Missing permission check** in `registerBroadcastReceiver` (CWE-862).\n2.  Unprivileged app changes the preferred TTY mode.\n3.  Local escalation of privilege.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **missing permission check** as the root cause, which directly aligns with CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating, \"The vulnerability stems from a missing permission check when registering a receiver for the `ACTION_TTY_PREFERRED_MODE_CHANGE` intent.\"\n\nThe **missing permission check** allows an unprivileged application to change the preferred TTY mode, leading to a local escalation of privilege. This matches the description of CWE-862, where the product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to perform an action.\n\nCWE-925 (Improper Verification of Intent by Broadcast Receiver) was considered since a broadcast receiver is involved. The evidence suggests that the core issue is the **missing permission check** rather than the improper verification of the intent itself. Therefore, CWE-862 is a more precise and suitable classification.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity. While it's a Class, the retriever results did not identify a Base or Variant alternative. Given the provided evidence, the **missing authorization** is the core weakness, and CWE-862 accurately captures this.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information\n- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.\n- **CVE-2009-3597:** Web application stores database file under the web root with insufficient access control (CWE-219), allowing direct request.",
