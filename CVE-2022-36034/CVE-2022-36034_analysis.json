It is related to CWE-407 (Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity) as a child. This relationship suggests that the inefficient regular expression is a specific type of inefficient algorithm.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe407 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the use of an inefficient regular expression (CWE-1333). This inefficiency leads to excessive CPU consumption, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, particularly the \"**rootcause:** **regular expression denial of service**\" phrase in the vulnerability description key phrases and the retriever results.\n\nCWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity) is the most appropriate because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"Possible ReDoS\" which stands for Regular expression Denial of Service. The description of CWE-1333 mentions ReDoS as an alternative term. The retriever results also show that CWE-1333 has a score of 1.0.\n\nThe other CWEs were considered but deemed less relevant. For example, CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) was considered, but the description doesn't talk about template engines.\n\nCWE-1333 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: the inefficient regular expression.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Similarity Score**: 1.000\n**Source**: alternate_terms\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
