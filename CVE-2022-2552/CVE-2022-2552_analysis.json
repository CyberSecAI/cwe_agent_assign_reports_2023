CWE-306 has relationships with CWE-287 **Improper Authentication**.\nCWE-425 **Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')** is related to CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** which is a child of CWE-285 **Improper Authorization**.\nThe abstraction levels influenced the decision to prefer the base-level CWE-306 and CWE-425 over the class-level CWE-862.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe425 secondary\n    class cwe862 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of authentication**, leading to direct access of sensitive information and ultimately information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-306 **Missing Authentication for Critical Function** as the primary weakness, which aligns with the vulnerability description stating that the plugin \"does not authenticate or authorize visitors before displaying information about the system\".\nThe **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** confirms this, stating the root cause is the \"Duplicator plugin for WordPress does not properly authenticate or authorize users before displaying sensitive system information.\" This directly supports the selection of CWE-306. The presence of \"no authentication\" further reinforces this choice.\nCWE-425 **Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')** is considered a secondary weakness because the vulnerability allows direct access to restricted URLs without proper authorization enforcement. The description of CWE-425, \"The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files,\" supports this classification.\nCWE-862 **Missing Authorization** is considered a tertiary weakness since it more generally describes the **lack of authorization** checks, but is less specific than CWE-306. It's a class-level CWE, making CWE-306 a better fit.\nThe retriever results also listed CWE-306 as the top candidate.\nThe final CWE selections are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-306 capturing the core **missing authentication** issue and CWE-425 highlighting the direct access aspect.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as \"/abs/path\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
