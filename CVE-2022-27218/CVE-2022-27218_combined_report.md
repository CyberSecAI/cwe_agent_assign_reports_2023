## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **unencrypted storage of tokens** (CWE-256) leading to the impact of allowing users with extended read permissions or access to the file system to view the tokens.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis pointed to CWE-256, CWE-522, CWE-260 and CWE-538. The final selection was made based on the specific details in the vulnerability description, the relationships between the CWEs, and the mapping guidance provided by MITRE. The analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" section which highlights the **rootcause** as **unencrypted storage of tokens**, and the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" which states that the incapptic connect uploader Plugin stores personal tokens unencrypted.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the **rootcause** of the vulnerability (CWE-256) and other potential contributing factors (CWE-538, CWE-260).

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
The vulnerability description clearly states that tokens are stored **unencrypted**, which directly aligns with the description of CWE-256: "Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise." The impact of this is that users with Extended Read permission can view the tokens. This is a direct consequence of the **plaintext storage**. The CWE-256 is a base level CWE and is a child of CWE-522. The mapping guidance recommends using Base level CWEs. Confidence: 1.0

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
The vulnerability involves storing tokens in `config.xml` files, which can be accessed by users with Extended Read permission. This aligns with CWE-538, which describes placing sensitive information into files or directories accessible to authorized users but not the sensitive information itself. The tokens are sensitive information, and the `config.xml` files are externally accessible to users with specific permissions. CWE-538 is a base level CWE. Confidence: 0.8

## CWE-260: Password in Configuration File
The vulnerability involves storing tokens in `config.xml` files. This aligns with CWE-260, which describes storing passwords in configuration files, leading to potential compromise. While the vulnerability involves tokens and not passwords, tokens are sensitive information. CWE-260 is a base level CWE. Confidence: 0.7

## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
CWE-522 is a class-level CWE that broadly covers situations where credentials are not adequately protected. The storage of **unencrypted tokens** falls under this category. However, given the more specific nature of CWE-256, CWE-522 is less preferred. The mapping guidance recommends reviewing children of this CWE to see if there is a better fit. Confidence: 0.6

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.


Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.


When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to "sniff" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.
