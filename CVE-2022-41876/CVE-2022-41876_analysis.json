Although it's a Class-level CWE and MITRE recommends selecting a Base-level CWE when possible, the provided information does not give enough evidence to select a lower-level CWE.\n\nCWE-201 and CWE-202 are related to information exposure but are at a base level of abstraction. They represent different aspects of the information exposure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe922[\"CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe202[\"CWE-202: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries\"]\n    \n    cwe201 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe922\n    cwe202 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe922\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe922 primary\n    class cwe201,cwe202 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **insecure storage of sensitive information** (CWE-922). This leads to the exposure of sensitive information either through sending the data (CWE-201) or through data queries (CWE-202).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **insecure storage of sensitive information** as the root cause. The vulnerability description clearly states \"**insecure storage of sensitive information**\" as the root cause. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further supports this by mentioning the exposure of password hashes and other sensitive user information through GraphQL queries.\n\nThe retriever results also indicate that CWE-922 is a strong candidate.\n\nGiven the evidence and the guidance to choose the most specific CWE, CWE-922 is selected as the primary CWE. CWE-201 and CWE-202 are supplementary because they describe the different ways the information is exposed. The selection of CWE-922 is at the Class level, but the evidence does not support a more specific Base or Variant CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the

CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that

abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is

Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6948.10\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other
