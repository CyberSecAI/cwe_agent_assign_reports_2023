CWE-863 is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), which, in turn, is a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). While CWE-863 is a class-level CWE and the mapping guidance suggests examining its children for a better fit, none of the child CWEs appear to be a more precise match for the provided vulnerability description. CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management) was considered but deemed less appropriate as it is often misused and the root cause seems more directly related to incorrect authorization checks. CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) was also considered as it relates to authorization bypass, but it's less specific to the **misconfigured endpoints**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|PEEROF| cwe269\n    cwe863 -->|PEEROF| cwe639\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe269,cwe639 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **misconfigured application endpoints**, leading to **incorrect authorization**, which allows attackers with user privileges to perform activities with admin privileges, ultimately compromising the confidentiality and integrity of the application.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-863 as the primary candidate due to the **misconfigured application endpoints** that enable attackers to perform activities with admin privileges. The retriever results and vulnerability description key phrases support this classification. The relationships among CWEs, particularly the parent-child relationship between CWE-863, CWE-285, and CWE-284, were considered to ensure that the chosen CWE was at the appropriate level of specificity. While CWE-863 is a class-level CWE, its description closely aligns with the vulnerability details, making it the most suitable option. The evidence is \"Due to **misconfigured application endpoints**, SAP SuccessFactors attachment APIs allow attackers with user privileges to perform activities with admin privileges over the network.\" The other possible CWEs such as CWE-269, CWE-639 are secondary in nature or less specific.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\nThis CWE was not selected because the vulnerability is related to **misconfigured application endpoints** that allowed users to perform activities with admin privileges.
