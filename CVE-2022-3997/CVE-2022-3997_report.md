# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2022-3997

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the decision is the ChildOf relationship between CWE-89 and CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')), and CWE-943 (Improper Neutralization Across Site For Scripting Sites). However, CWE-89 is a more specific **rootcause** for SQL Injection. No chain relationships strongly influenced this decision, as the immediate cause is the **improper sanitization** leading directly to SQL injection.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper input sanitization**, leading directly to the impact of SQL injection.
  - **Root Cause:** **Improper input sanitization**
  - **Weakness:** CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
  - **Impact:** Allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized access.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified the **rootcause** as **improper input sanitization** leading to SQL injection. The analysis strongly relies on the vulnerability description and key phrases, particularly the statement about manipulation of arguments leading to SQL injection.

> Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
> - **rootcause:** **improper input sanitization**
> - **impact:** sql injection
> - **vector:** manipulation of email/lozinka/ime/id argument

The retriever results and graph relationships reinforce that CWE-89 is the most appropriate and specific CWE. Other CWEs were considered but deemed less relevant. For example, CWE-74 is a parent class, but CWE-89 directly addresses the SQL injection vulnerability. The decision to use CWE-89 is based on its specificity and direct alignment with the provided evidence.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

**Explanation:** While CWE-74 is a parent of CWE-89, it is too general for this case. The vulnerability is specifically an SQL Injection, making CWE-89 a better fit.

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Explanation:** This CWE is related to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), which is not the vulnerability described. The description clearly states SQL Injection, not XSS.

## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Explanation:** This CWE is related to HTTP Request/Response Splitting, which is not the vulnerability described. The description clearly states SQL Injection.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Explanation:** While there's a reliance on untrusted inputs, the more specific issue is that these inputs are not properly neutralized before being used in an SQL query.

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Explanation:** This is not the primary issue. The core problem is the lack of neutralization, not the validation of equivalence.

## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

**Explanation:** This CWE is not applicable. The vulnerability is not related to interaction frequency.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Explanation:** This CWE is not applicable. The vulnerability is not related to path equivalence.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Explanation:** While there could be an incomplete list of disallowed inputs, the main issue is the lack of neutralization of special characters in SQL commands.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which
