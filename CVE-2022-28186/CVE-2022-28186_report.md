# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2022-28186

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Discouraged: Consider lower-level children. |
| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is that CWE-1284 is a ChildOf CWE-20. CWE-20 is a high-level Class, while CWE-1284 is a more specific Base. Although CWE-20 is flagged as Discouraged, it remains the closest single fit, capturing the essence of the **unvalidated input** weakness. However, given the context hints towards the quantity i.e size or length, CWE-1284 is considered as a supporting, more specific CWE.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **unvalidated input** received by the NVIDIA GPU Display Driver. This **weakness** leads to potential denial of service and data tampering.
  - The root cause is the lack of input validation (CWE-20).
  - A more specific weakness could be the lack of validation of input quantity (CWE-1284).
  - The impact is denial of service or data tampering.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified CWE-20 as the primary candidate due to the explicit mention of **"does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly."** However, the Retriever Results and Complete CWE Specifications suggested considering more specific CWEs. The vulnerability description indicates that the driver **fails to validate the properties of the input data**, which aligns with the description of CWE-20. The "denial of service or data tampering" impact suggests potential consequences of this **weakness**. Given that the quantity of the input may be a factor, CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is considered.

The final decision is based on the evidence that the driver receives input but **fails to validate its properties**. This aligns directly with CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation). While CWE-20 is a Class-level CWE and is generally discouraged, no other CWE provides a better, more precise fit. Given the potential relevance of quantity, CWE-1284 is noted as a secondary candidate. The selected CWEs are at an optimal level of specificity, capturing the essence of the vulnerability while acknowledging its potential nuances.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.81
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why Not Selected:** This vulnerability focuses on **improper input validation**, not privilege handling.

## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.81
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.

**Why Not Selected:** This vulnerability focuses on **improper input validation**, not privilege handling.

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why Not Selected:** This CWE is too specific and does not fit the general description of the vulnerability, which is about **improper input validation** in general.

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

**Why Not Selected:** This vulnerability focuses on **improper input validation**, not improper locking.

## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

**Why Not Selected:** While the description mentions not checking, the root cause is clearly about **improper input validation**, not the handling of exceptional conditions.

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

**Why Not Selected:** This vulnerability focuses on **improper input validation**, not resource management.

## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why Not Selected:** This vulnerability focuses on **improper input validation**, not isolation or compartmentalization.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why Not Selected:** This vulnerability focuses on **improper input validation** in general, not specifically path equivalence.

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why Not Selected:** While a buffer overflow could be a consequence, the root cause is the **lack of input validation**, not the buffer size calculation.

## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.

**Why Not Selected:** This vulnerability focuses on **improper input validation**, not the handling of exceptional conditions.
