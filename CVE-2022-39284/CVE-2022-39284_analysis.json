The vulnerability specifically involves the absence of the HttpOnly flag on a sensitive cookie, which directly aligns with CWE-1004's description. CWE-614 (Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute) was considered as a secondary candidate due to the potential absence of the Secure attribute in HTTPS sessions, but the description focuses more on the `httponly` flag.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1004[\"CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Security-Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe614[\"CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"]\n    \n    cwe1004 -->|CHILDOF| cwe732\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1004 primary\n    class cwe732,cwe614 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **improper** configuration of cookie settings in CodeIgniter, specifically the **failure** to correctly apply the `$secure` and `$httponly` flags from the `Config\\Cookie` file. This **leads** to cookies being created without the HttpOnly flag, **resulting** in the potential exposure of cookie values to scripts.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-1004 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of the `httponly` flag. The vulnerability description clearly states that setting `$secure` or `$httponly` to `true` in `Config\\Cookie` is **not reflected** in `set_cookie()` or `ResponsesetCookie()`, **resulting** in cookie values being erroneously exposed to scripts. This directly aligns with CWE-1004's description: \"The product uses a cookie to store sensitive information, but the cookie is not marked with the HttpOnly flag.\"\n\nThe retriever results also support this classification, with CWE-1004 being the top-ranked CWE. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section confirms that the root cause is the failure to inherit default values for the secure and httponly flags.\n\nThe CWE-614 was considered as a secondary weakness, the primary issue highlighted is the absence of the `httponly` flag. The decision to prioritize CWE-1004 is based on the clear and direct evidence of the missing `httponly` flag.\n\nThe selected CWE, CWE-1004, is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the vulnerability's root cause and impact. It accurately represents the specific weakness of a sensitive cookie lacking the HttpOnly flag, making it more precise than its parent, CWE-732.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
