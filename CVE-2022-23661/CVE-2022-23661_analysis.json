The primary CWE match from the provided data is CWE-78, \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection').\" This aligns directly with the vulnerability description's mention of **command injection**.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision is strong, and the retriever results also list CWE-78 as a top candidate. The description matches the scenario where the product constructs an OS command using external input without proper neutralization.\n\nThe selection of CWE-78 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the **OS command injection** rather than a more general injection issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\nThis CWE was considered, but CWE-78 is more specific since the command injection involves OS commands.\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\nThis CWE was considered but is not relevant because the vulnerability is about **command injection**, not path traversal.\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\nThis CWE was considered but is not relevant because the vulnerability is about **command injection**, not SQL injection.\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\nThis CWE was considered but is not relevant because the vulnerability is about **command injection**, not path traversal.\n## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\nThis CWE was considered but is not relevant because the description explicitly refers to command injection.\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\nThis CWE was considered but is not relevant because the vulnerability is about **command injection**, not file path manipulation.\n## CWE-284: Improper Access Control\nThis CWE was considered but is not relevant because the description explicitly refers to command injection.\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\nThis CWE was considered but is too high-level; CWE-78 provides more specificity.\n## CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\nThis CWE was considered, but CWE-78 is more relevant as it directly addresses the **OS command injection** vulnerability.",
