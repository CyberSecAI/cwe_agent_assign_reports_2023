This is related to CWE-20 (**Improper Input Validation**) as a child. CWE-1284 can precede CWE-789 (**Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value**).\n\nCWE-400 (**Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**) is a Class-level CWE that could result from the **Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input**.\n\nCWE-306 (**Missing Authentication for Critical Function**) is a **Base** level CWE that could also contribute to the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe1284 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe789\n    cwe1284 -->|CANLEADTO| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1284 primary\n    class cwe20,cwe789,cwe400,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input** (CWE-1284) - The plugin does not validate the length of data from unauthenticated users.\n2.  Missing Authentication (CWE-306) enables unauthenticated users to send data.\n3.  **Impact:** Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400), leading to Denial of Service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified that the Custom Popup Builder WordPress plugin before 1.3.1 is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The root cause is the **lack of validation** on the length of data sent by unauthenticated users. This data is autoloaded on every page, which can lead to excessive resource consumption.\n\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-1284 (**Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input**). This CWE accurately describes the core issue of the plugin failing to validate the length of the data it receives. The vulnerability description states that the data is \"not validated in length,\" which directly aligns with the definition of CWE-1284.\n> \"The plugin loads popup data on every page, and this data can be sent by unauthenticated users without validation of the data's length.\"\n\nThe retriever results listed CWE-1284 as the top combined result, further supporting this selection.\n\nCWE-400 (**Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**) is considered a secondary CWE because the **lack of validation** (CWE-1284) leads to this condition. An attacker can send a large amount of data, causing the server to consume excessive resources.\n\nCWE-306 (**Missing Authentication for Critical Function**) is also a secondary candidate. The fact that an unauthenticated user can send the malicious data contributes to the vulnerability's exploitability.\n\nCWE-20 (**Improper Input Validation**) was considered as a parent of CWE-1284, but CWE-1284 is more specific and therefore more appropriate.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-1284 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred for mapping to root causes. CWE-400 is a Class level CWE that describes the impact of the vulnerability. CWE-306 is a Base level CWE that describes another contributing factor.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
