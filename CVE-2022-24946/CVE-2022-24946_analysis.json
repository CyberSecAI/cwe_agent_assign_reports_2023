CWE-400 is a Class level CWE and parent of CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling). The relationship between CWE-413 and CWE-400 is not direct, but resource locking issues can lead to uncontrolled resource consumption, especially if locks are not released properly, potentially causing denial of service.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe413[\"CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n\n    cwe413 -->|CHILDOF| cwe667\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe413 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Resource Locking** (CWE-413). If resource locking is not correctly implemented, it can lead to race conditions or deadlocks. In this case, the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section mentions a stack-based buffer overflow which is not described in the main \"Vulnerability Description\". The **Improper Resource Locking** can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the provided evidence, mainly the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**Improper Resource Locking**\" as the root cause. The CVE reference summary confirms this and adds that it leads to a stack-based buffer overflow and denial of service. The retriever results also list CWE-413 as the top candidate.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-413 (Improper Resource Locking). The evidence strongly supports this classification, as it is explicitly mentioned in the vulnerability description and confirmed in the CVE reference summary. The abstraction level is Base, which is preferred.\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) was considered as a secondary CWE because **improper resource locking** can lead to resource exhaustion. However, CWE-400 is discouraged due to its broad nature. The evidence for CWE-400 is indirect, so the confidence is lower.\n\nCWE-130 (Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency) and CWE-805 (Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value) were considered because the CVE summary mentions a stack-based buffer overflow, however the evidence is insufficient to include these CWEs.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-413 directly reflects the **root cause** described in the vulnerability, and is a base level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale:

abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This

have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is
