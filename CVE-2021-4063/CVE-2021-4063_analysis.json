The description strongly points to a Use After Free condition, making CWE-416 the most appropriate variant. Other CWEs like CWE-123, CWE-415, and CWE-787 were considered but deemed less directly relevant.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource after Expiration\"]\n    \n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe825,cwe672 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of the following sequence:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Use after free** (CWE-416) in developer tools.\n2.  **Weakness:** **Heap corruption**.\n3.  **Impact:** Potential to exploit **heap corruption**\n4.  **Attack Vector:** Crafted HTML page.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly suggests CWE-416 as the primary CWE due to the explicit mention of \"**use after free**\" in the vulnerability description, key phrases, and CVE reference links content summary.
