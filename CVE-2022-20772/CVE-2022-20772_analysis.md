# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-113 | Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting') | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |

| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.5 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-113, which is a Variant of CWE-93 and a child of CWE-20 and CWE-436. CWE-93 can precede CWE-117. CWE-113 can precede CWE-79. The relationships show the progression from a general input issue (CWE-20) to the specific CRLF injection (CWE-93) that leads to HTTP Response Splitting (CWE-113).

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper input sanitization**, leading to CRLF injection and finally resulting in HTTP response splitting.
  - **Root Cause:** **Improper Input Sanitization**
  - **Weakness:** CRLF Injection (CWE-93)
  - **Impact:** HTTP Response Splitting (CWE-113)

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified CWE-113 as the primary weakness due to the description of HTTP response splitting and the **improper sanitization** of input. The relationships between CWE-113 and its parent CWE-93 (CRLF Injection) support this conclusion. CWE-20, a parent of CWE-113, represents the general **improper input validation** but is less specific.

The evidence from the vulnerability description includes:
*   "This vulnerability is due to the failure of the application or its environment to properly sanitize input values."
*   "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious HTTP headers, controlling the response body, or splitting the response into multiple responses."
*   "The vulnerability stems from the failure of the Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager to properly sanitize input values."

CWE-113 is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability, making it the optimal choice. CWE-93 is a valid secondary classification as the root cause of the splitting. CWE-20 is too general and therefore less appropriate.
