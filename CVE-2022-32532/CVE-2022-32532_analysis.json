The vulnerability description explicitly states that the application is \"possibly vulnerable to an authorization bypass.\" This is strong evidence supporting the selection of CWE-863.\n\nCWE-185 is a secondary consideration because the **misconfiguration** likely stems from an **incorrect regular expression**, but the direct impact is the authorization failure. Selecting CWE-863 is a good fit because the vulnerability description states the application is \"possibly vulnerable to an authorization bypass.\"\n\nI am selecting CWE-863 and CWE-185 at the Class level as there is no variant or base that better describes the **misconfiguration** of the regex that leads to the authorization bypass.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## Vulnerability Description\nApache Shiro before 1.9.1, A RegexRequestMatcher can be **misconfigured to be bypassed** on some servlet containers. Applications using RegExPatternMatcher with `.` in the regular expression are possibly vulnerable to an **authorization bypass**.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **misconfigured A RegexRequestMatcher**\n- **impact:** authorization bypass\n- **product:** Apache Shiro\n- **version:** before 1.9.1\n- **component:** RegExPatternMatcher\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.221 |\n| 2 | 1333 | Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.210 |\n| 3 | 552 | Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.198 |\n| 4 | 917 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.186 |\n| 5 | 201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.184 |\n| 6 | 185 | Incorrect Regular Expression | Class | Allowed-with-Review | dense | 0.537 |\n| 7 | 182 | Collapse of Data into Unsafe Value | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.183 |\n| 9 | 668 | Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.183 |\n| 10 | 732 | Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.183 |\n\n**CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization**: The vulnerability description explicitly states \"authorization bypass,\" making this the most relevant CWE. The **root cause** is the **misconfiguration** which directly leads to the bypass. This aligns perfectly with the CWE description: \"The product performs an authorization check...but it does not correctly perform the check.\" The usage is \"Allowed-with-Review\" because it's a Class, but given the direct evidence, it's a suitable choice.\n\n**CWE-185 Incorrect Regular Expression**: While not the primary issue, the **misconfigured RegexRequestMatcher** strongly suggests a problem with the regular expression itself. CWE-185's description, \"The product specifies a regular expression in a way that causes data to be improperly matched or compared,\" aligns with the potential root cause. The usage is \"Allowed-with-Review\" because it's a Class, however, there are no more specific Base/Variants of the CWE.\n\n**CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity**: This is less likely because the issue is not about performance (excessive CPU cycles) but about a functional bypass due to **misconfiguration**. Therefore, this CWE is not appropriate.\n\n**CWE-552 Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties**: This is not relevant as the issue is not about file access, but about bypassing authorization checks.\n\n**CWE-917 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')**: This is not relevant because the vulnerability is related to how the regular expression is configured, not about injecting code into an expression language statement.\n\n**CWE-201 Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data**: This is not relevant because the issue is not about sensitive information being sent, but about bypassing authorization.\n\n**CWE-182 Collapse of Data into Unsafe Value**: This is not relevant as the issue is not about collapsing data, but about bypassing authorization.\n\n**CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function**: This is not relevant because the authorization is present but the **misconfigured RegexRequestMatcher** isn't performing the check correctly.\n\n**CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere**: This is too high-level and generic. CWE-863 provides a more specific description of the authorization failure. Additionally, the Mapping Guidance recommends against using it and to \"Closely analyze the specific mistake.\"\n\n**CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource**: This is not relevant because the issue is related to the **misconfigured RegexRequestMatcher** and not about incorrect permission assignments for a critical resource.",
