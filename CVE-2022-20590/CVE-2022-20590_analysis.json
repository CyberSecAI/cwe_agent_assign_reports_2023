While discouraged for direct mapping, the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**improper input validation**\" as the root cause, which aligns directly with the definition of CWE-20 ([CWE-20: Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)). The retriever results also list CWE-20 ([CWE-20: Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)) as a potential match, further supporting this selection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe20 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation**, which then leads to information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states that the root cause is \"**improper input validation**.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by mentioning the vulnerability lies within a component and leads to information disclosure.\n\nThe retriever results list CWE-20 ([CWE-20: Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)) as a candidate, but it's discouraged for direct mapping because it's a Class-level CWE, and more specific CWEs are preferred. However, in this case, the description directly uses the term \"**improper input validation**,\" making CWE-20 ([CWE-20: Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)) the most accurate representation of the vulnerability's root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
