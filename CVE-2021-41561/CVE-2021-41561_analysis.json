While CWE-20 is a general weakness, it aligns with the description of the vulnerability. CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-400 (Resource Consumption), which could be a consequence of the improper input validation. The relationship between CWE-20 and CWE-770 is that improper input validation can lead to excessive resource allocation, eventually causing a denial-of-service.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe770 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20) of a malicious Parquet file, leading to excessive resource allocation and consumption (CWE-770), which ultimately results in a denial-of-service (DoS) impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the provided evidence, points towards **improper input validation** (CWE-20) as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description states \"**Improper Input Validation** vulnerability in Parquet-MR of Apache Parquet allows an attacker to DoS by malicious Parquet files.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating, \"Root Cause of Vulnerability: **Improper Input Validation** in Apache Parquet-MR\" and \"The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation when processing Parquet files. This allows specially crafted (malicious) Parquet files to trigger the vulnerability.\"\n\nWhile CWE-20 is a high-level class, it aligns with the root cause explicitly mentioned in the description. The retriever results also list CWE-20 as the top combined result. However, the mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-20 and suggests considering lower-level children.\n\nGiven that the impact is a denial-of-service, a secondary weakness of CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is also considered. The improper input validation allows for the allocation of excessive resources, eventually leading to the DoS.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity based on the available evidence. While a more specific variant of input validation might exist, the description primarily highlights the lack of validation as the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
