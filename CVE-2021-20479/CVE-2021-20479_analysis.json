CWE-326 **(Inadequate Encryption Strength)** is a Class-level CWE that can encompass various Base-level weaknesses related to the strength of encryption. The vulnerability description indicates the use of **weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms**, which aligns well with the definition of CWE-326. The description's mention of potential decryption of sensitive information emphasizes the impact of inadequate encryption strength. CWE-327 **(Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm)** is also a Class-level CWE and a peer of CWE-311. CWE-327 is considered a secondary weakness since \"weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms\" does not necessarily mean broken, but could simply mean \"risky\".\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe326[\"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe326 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe327 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe311 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe327 --|PEEROF| cwe311\n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe326 primary\n    class cwe327,cwe311,cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events for this vulnerability starts with the **ROOT CAUSE**: using **weak cryptographic algorithms**. This leads to the IMPACT: an attacker being able to **decrypt highly sensitive information**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability description clearly points to a problem with the cryptographic algorithms used by the IBM Cloud Pak System. The evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states that \"The vulnerability stems from the use of **weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms** during negotiation in IBM Cloud Pak System,\" and that \"TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are not disabled by default.\" This supports the selection of CWE-326 **(Inadequate Encryption Strength)** as the primary CWE, as it directly addresses the use of encryption that is not strong enough.\n\nAdditionally, the use of older TLS versions (1.0 and 1.1) that are not disabled by default suggests a potential risk of transmitting sensitive data in cleartext if the newer, stronger encryption methods are not negotiated. This supports considering CWE-319 **(Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information)**. The fact that encryption is present, but weak, rules out a more direct \"missing encryption\" classification like CWE-311, but the possibility of falling back to older TLS versions makes it a secondary concern.\n\nCWE-327 was considered because the algorithms may be broken.\n\nCWE-326 is the most specific and relevant to the provided evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n*   **CWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength)**: This CWE is a Class, but it best describes the vulnerability, as the main issue is that the encryption used is **weaker than expected**.\n*   **CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm)**: This CWE is a Class, but it's relevant because the **weak algorithms** could be considered risky. It is a secondary candidate.\n*   **CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data)**: This CWE is a Class, but less relevant because the system *does* use encryption, albeit **weak** encryption. Therefore, it is a secondary candidate.\n*   **CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information)**: This CWE is a Base level and is a child of CWE-311. It's relevant because older TLS versions being enabled could allow sensitive data to be sent without strong encryption during negotiation. Therefore, it is a secondary candidate.",
