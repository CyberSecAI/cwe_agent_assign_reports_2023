CWE-787 is a base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The parent child relationship of CWE-787 to CWE-119 was considered.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is **memory corruption** due to a specially crafted HTTP request leading to an **out-of-bounds write**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the vulnerability description and the retriever results. The description clearly states that **a memory corruption vulnerability** exists which can lead to an **out-of-bounds write**.\n\nThe primary CWE match from the retriever results was CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write. The vulnerability description supports this selection, as it directly mentions the **out-of-bounds write**.\n\nThe selection is based on the provided evidence only, and the evidence is: \"A **memory corruption vulnerability** exists in the netserver parse_command_list functionality of reolink RLC-410W v3.0.0.136_20121102.
