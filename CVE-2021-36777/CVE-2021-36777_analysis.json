The vulnerability description and CVE reference links confirm that the `login-proxy` accepted an unsanitized `url` parameter, allowing attackers to redirect credentials to an attacker-controlled server.\n\n*   The assessment is primarily based on the provided evidence, specifically:\n    *   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** \"**rootcause:** **reliance on untrusted inputs**\"\n    *   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** \"The `login-proxy` used by SUSE and openSUSE services was vulnerable to a flaw where it could be tricked into sending user credentials (username and password) to an attacker-controlled server. This was due to the `login-proxy` accepting a `url` parameter which was not properly sanitized.\"\n\n*   The graph relationships influenced the selection by prioritizing the base-level CWE (CWE-807) over the class-level CWEs (CWE-522, CWE-863) for the primary mapping.\n\n*   The selected CWE, CWE-807, is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability which is the **reliance on untrusted inputs** when making security decisions.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n*   **CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision**\n    *   The `login-proxy` uses the `url` parameter without proper sanitization.\n    *   Attackers can modify this input to redirect credentials to their own server.\n    *   This aligns with the CWE description: \"The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\"\n    *   Confidence: 1\n\n*   **CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials**\n    *   The credentials are sent in clear text to the attacker specified server.\n    *   This is a valid, but secondary issue as the root cause is the **reliance on untrusted inputs**\n    *   Confidence: 0.7\n\n*   **CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization**\n    *   The `login-proxy` does not correctly authorize the redirect URL.\n    *   The check is missing or insufficient, allowing unauthorized redirection.\n    *   This is a valid, but secondary issue as the root cause is the **reliance on untrusted inputs**.\n    *   Confidence: 0.6\n\n*   **CWEs Considered but Not Used:**\n    *   CWE-61, CWE-184, CWE-183, CWE-1289, CWE-303, CWE-41, CWE-204, CWE-1391, CWE-1390, CWE-668, CWE-59, CWE-386, CWE-434, CWE-78, CWE-79, CWE-22, CWE-98, CWE-252, CWE-367, CWE-178, CWE-113, CWE-697, CWE-565\n    *   These CWEs were considered, but ultimately deemed less relevant as they did not directly address the root cause which is the **reliance on untrusted inputs** in security decisions. For example, CWE-61 (UNIX Symbolic Link Following) is not applicable as the vulnerability does not involve symbolic links.",
