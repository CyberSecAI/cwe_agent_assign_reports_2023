CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) can also be a related weakness, as the information obtained through the discrepancy might include sensitive data. The relationships between these CWEs influenced the decision to include both, with CWE-203 as the primary cause due to the observable nature of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe203[\"CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    \n    cwe203 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe201 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe203\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe203 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of** proper URL request validation in the CobaltStrike HTTP(S) listener. This **allows** attackers to specify arbitrary URLs, leading to an observable discrepancy in the server's response. This discrepancy **results** in the potential insertion of sensitive information into the response, which can then be obtained by the attacker.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description, which states that attackers can obtain relevant information by specifying the URL in CobaltStrike <=4.5 HTTP(S) listener. The key phrase \"obtain relevant information\" strongly suggests an information disclosure vulnerability.\n\nThe Retriever Results listed several candidate CWEs, including:\n\n*   CWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name\n*   CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n*   CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n*   CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n*   CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n*   CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings\n*   CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n*   CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n*   CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n*   CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\n\nBased on the vulnerability description and the definitions of the CWEs, CWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy) is the most relevant. The vulnerability allows attackers to observe differences in the server's response based on the specified URL, which can reveal sensitive information. CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) is also relevant, as the \"relevant information\" obtained could be sensitive.\n\nCWE-203 is chosen as the primary CWE because the root cause is the observable difference in behavior based on attacker-controlled input.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTwo separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
