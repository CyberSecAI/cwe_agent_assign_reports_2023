# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-269 is commonly misused. It can be conflated with "privilege escalation," which is a technical impact that is listed in many low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis.
**Comments:** If an error or mistake allows privilege escalation, then use the CWE ID for that mistake. Avoid using CWE-269 when only phrases such as "privilege escalation" or "gain privileges" are available, as these indicate technical impact of the vulnerability - not the root cause weakness. If the root cause seems to be directly related to privileges, then examine the children of CWE-269 for additional hints, such as Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250) or Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266).
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-1555:** Terminal privileges are not reset when a user logs out.
- **CVE-2001-1514:** Does not properly pass security context to child processes in certain cases, allows privilege escalation.
- **CVE-2001-0128:** Does not properly compute roles.




## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description


Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.


When access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.


### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information
- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.
- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.




## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

### Extended Description


Resources such as files and directories may be inadvertently exposed through mechanisms such as insecure permissions, or when a program accidentally operates on the wrong object. For example, a program may intend that private files can only be provided to a specific user. This effectively defines a control sphere that is intended to prevent attackers from accessing these private files. If the file permissions are insecure, then parties other than the user will be able to access those files.


A separate control sphere might effectively require that the user can only access the private files, but not any other files on the system. If the program does not ensure that the user is only requesting private files, then the user might be able to access other files on the system.


In either case, the end result is that a resource has been exposed to the wrong party.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-664

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.
**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** A "control sphere" is a set of resources and behaviors that are accessible to a single actor, or a group of actors. A product's security model will typically define multiple spheres, possibly implicitly. For example, a server might define one sphere for "administrators" who can create new user accounts with subdirectories under /home/server/, and a second sphere might cover the set of users who can create or delete files within their own subdirectories. A third sphere might be "users who are authenticated to the operating system on which the product is installed." Each sphere has different sets of actors and allowable behaviors.






## CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment.

### Extended Description


When a product allows a user's input to contain code syntax, it might be possible for an attacker to craft the code in such a way that it will alter the intended control flow of the product. Such an alteration could lead to arbitrary code execution.


Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.


### Alternative Terms

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-74
ChildOf -> CWE-74
ChildOf -> CWE-913

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This entry is frequently misused for vulnerabilities with a technical impact of "code execution," which does not by itself indicate a root cause weakness, since dozens of weaknesses can enable code execution.
**Comments:** This weakness only applies when the product's functionality intentionally constructs all or part of a code segment. It could be that executing code could be the result of other weaknesses that do not involve the construction of code segments.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
- Frequent Misinterpretation



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-29374:** Math component in an LLM framework translates user input into a Python expression that is input into the Python exec() method, allowing code execution - one variant of a "prompt injection" attack.
- **CVE-2024-5565:** Python-based library uses an LLM prompt containing user input to dynamically generate code that is then fed as input into the Python exec() method, allowing code execution - one variant of a "prompt injection" attack.
- **CVE-2024-4181:** Framework for LLM applications allows eval injection via a crafted response from a hosting provider.




## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.

### Extended Description


There are many different kinds of mistakes that introduce information exposures. The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker. Some kinds of sensitive information include:


  - private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details

  - system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages

  - business secrets and intellectual property

  - network status and configuration

  - the product's own code or internal state

  - metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers

  - indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider

Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected. These parties include:

  - the product's own users

  - people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users

  - the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates

  - the developer

Information exposures can occur in different ways:

  - the code  **explicitly inserts**  sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been "scrubbed" or "sanitized"

  - a different weakness or mistake  **indirectly inserts**  the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.

  - the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are  **unintentionally made accessible**  to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.

It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an "information exposure," but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read. CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store, transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

### Alternative Terms
Information Disclosure: This term is frequently used in vulnerability advisories to describe a consequence or technical impact, for any vulnerability that has a loss of confidentiality. Often, CWE-200 can be misused to represent the loss of confidentiality, even when the mistake - i.e., the weakness - is not directly related to the mishandling of the information itself, such as an out-of-bounds read that accesses sensitive memory contents; here, the out-of-bounds read is the primary weakness, not the disclosure of the memory. In addition, this phrase is also used frequently in policies and legal documents, but it does not refer to any disclosure of security-relevant information.
Information Leak: This is a frequently used term, however the "leak" term has multiple uses within security. In some cases it deals with the accidental exposure of information from a different weakness, but in other cases (such as "memory leak"), this deals with improper tracking of resources, which can lead to exhaustion. As a result, CWE is actively avoiding usage of the "leak" term.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].
**Comments:** If an error or mistake causes information to be disclosed, then use the CWE ID for that error. Consider starting with improper authorization (CWE-285), insecure permissions (CWE-732), improper authentication (CWE-287), etc. Also consider children such as Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data (CWE-201), Observable Discrepancy (CWE-203), Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory (CWE-538), or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As a result of mapping analysis in the 2020 Top 25 and more recent versions, this weakness is under review, since it is frequently misused in mapping to cover many problems that lead to loss of confidentiality. See Mapping Notes, Extended Description, and Alternate Terms.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-31162:** Rust library leaks Oauth client details in application debug logs
- **CVE-2021-25476:** Digital Rights Management (DRM) capability for mobile platform leaks pointer information, simplifying ASLR bypass
- **CVE-2001-1483:** Enumeration of valid usernames based on inconsistent responses




## CWE-278: Insecure Preserved Inherited Permissions
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
A product inherits a set of insecure permissions for an object, e.g. when copying from an archive file, without user awareness or involvement.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-732

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-1724:** Does not obey specified permissions when exporting.




## CWE-499: Serializable Class Containing Sensitive Data
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The code contains a class with sensitive data, but the class does not explicitly deny serialization. The data can be accessed by serializing the class through another class.

### Extended Description
Serializable classes are effectively open classes since data cannot be hidden in them. Classes that do not explicitly deny serialization can be serialized by any other class, which can then in turn use the data stored inside it.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-668
CanPrecede -> CWE-200

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use






## CWE-287: Improper Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
authentification: An alternate term is "authentification", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.
AuthN: "AuthN" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authentication" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from "AuthZ," which is an abbreviation of "authorization." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.
AuthC: "AuthC" is used as an abbreviation of "authentication," but it appears to used less frequently than "AuthN."

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).




## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-287
ChildOf -> CWE-287

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-31260:** Chain: a digital asset management program has an undisclosed backdoor in the legacy version of a PHP script (CWE-912) that could allow an unauthenticated user to export metadata (CWE-306)
- **CVE-2022-29951:** TCP-based protocol in Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) has no authentication.
- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.
