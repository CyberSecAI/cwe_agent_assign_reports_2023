## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **DTLS resumption handshake falls back to a DTLS full handshake on a parameter mismatch**. This leads to the **missing HelloVerifyRequest during fallback**, which results in **message amplification** and **high CPU load**, ultimately causing a Denial of Service (DoS).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the server's failure to perform a `HelloVerifyRequest` during a full handshake fallback on session resumption attempts with mismatched parameters. This missing check allows an attacker to force the server into expensive full handshakes, leading to resource exhaustion and amplification attacks.

The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference links supports this analysis:

*   **Vulnerability Description:** "DTLS resumption handshake falls back to a DTLS full handshake on a parameter mismatch without using a HelloVerifyRequest...that results in message amplification (DDoS other peers) and high CPU load (DoS own peer)."
*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) implementation of Eclipse Californium...the server incorrectly falls back to a full handshake without performing a stateless cookie exchange using a HelloVerifyRequest. This bypass of the cookie exchange mechanism is the root cause."

The graph relationships and retriever results also influenced the final selection. CWE-408 (Incorrect Behavior Order: Early Amplification) was identified as the best match due to the server performing an expensive operation (full handshake) before proper authentication (HelloVerifyRequest). The MITRE mapping guidance allows for the use of CWE-408 as it is at the Base level of abstraction.

The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2022-2576

## Vulnerability Description
In Eclipse Californium version 2.0.0 to 2.7.2 and 3.0.0-3.5.0 a **DTLS resumption handshake falls back to a DTLS full handshake on a parameter mismatch** without using a HelloVerifyRequest. Especially, if used with certificate based cipher suites, that results in message amplification (DDoS other peers) and high CPU load (DoS own peer). The misbehavior occurs only with DTLS_VERIFY_PEERS_ON_RESUMPTION_THRESHOLD values larger than 0.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **DTLS resumption handshake falls back to a DTLS full handshake on a parameter mismatch**
- **impact:** message amplification and high CPU load
- **vector:** mismatch in DTLS_VERIFY_PEERS_ON_RESUMPTION_THRESHOLD values
- **product:** Eclipse Californium
- **version:** 2.0.0 to 2.7.2 and 3.0.0-3.5.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2576:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) implementation of Eclipse Californium. Specifically, during session resumption, if a client attempts to resume a session with a different cipher suite than what was initially negotiated, the server incorrectly falls back to a full handshake without performing a stateless cookie exchange using a HelloVerifyRequest. This bypass of the cookie exchange mechanism is the root cause.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing HelloVerifyRequest during fallback:** The DTLS server fails to send a `HelloVerifyRequest` when a session resumption attempt triggers a fallback to a full handshake due to a parameter mismatch (e.g., different cipher suite).
*   **Bypass of DoS protection:** The stateless cookie exchange, intended to protect against DoS attacks, is skipped, making the server susceptible to resource exhaustion and amplification attacks.
*   **Incorrect handling of session resumption:** The server does not properly enforce the requirement for the same cipher suite during session resumption.
*  **Missing check of cipher suite**: During session resumption, the server did not check if the cipher suite of the client hello matched the one from the stored session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a DoS on the server. By repeatedly sending ClientHello messages with different cipher suites but valid session IDs, the attacker can force the server into expensive full handshakes, consuming excessive resources (CPU, memory).
*   **Amplification Attack:** The vulnerability also exposes the server to use as an amplification vector. An attacker can send connection initiation messages with a forged source IP address, causing the server to send large responses (e.g., Certificate messages) to the victim, potentially overwhelming the victim's network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based attacks:** The attack is performed over the network by sending crafted DTLS handshake messages (ClientHello).
*   **Spoofed IP address:** By using forged source addresses the attacker can perform an amplification attack.
*   **Repeated Session Resumption Attempts:** The attack relies on the server's failure to perform a `HelloVerifyRequest` during a full handshake fallback on session resumption attempts with mismatched parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable DTLS server.
*   **Valid Session IDs:** The attacker must obtain valid session IDs from previous connections to initiate the attack, if `DTLS_VERIFY_PEERS_ON_RESUMPTION_THRESHOLD` is enabled.
*   **Ability to Send DTLS Messages:** The attacker needs to be able to send DTLS packets (ClientHello) with specific parameters, including a valid session ID and a different cipher suite.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Eclipse Californium versions 2.0.0 to 2.7.2 and 3.0.0 to 3.5.0
*   The vulnerability is triggered when  `DTLS_VERIFY_PEERS_ON_RESUMPTION_THRESHOLD` is larger than zero. Setting this property to 0 mitigates the vulnerability.
*   The fix involves ensuring the HelloVerifyRequest is always used when falling back to a full handshake.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-408 (Incorrect Behavior Order: Early Amplification)

## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.

### Extended Description


Cryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.


It is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.


Since the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered "unsafe" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.


For a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples

- **[REF-1374]:** Chain: JavaScript-based cryptocurrency library can fall back to the insecure Math.random() function instead of reporting a failure (CWE-392), thus reducing the entropy (CWE-332) and leading to generation of non-unique cryptographic keys for Bitcoin wallets (CWE-1391)
- **CVE-2021-3011:** virtual interrupt controller in a virtualization product allows crash of host by writing a certain invalid value to a register, which triggers a fatal error instead of returning an error code




## CWE-599: Missing Validation of OpenSSL Certificate
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses OpenSSL and trusts or uses a certificate without using the SSL_get_verify_result() function to ensure that the certificate satisfies all necessary security requirements.

### Extended Description
This could allow an attacker to use an invalid certificate to claim to be a trusted host, use expired certificates, or conduct other attacks that could be detected if the certificate is properly validated.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-295

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** CWE-295 and CWE-599 are very similar, although CWE-599 has a more narrow scope that is only applied to OpenSSL certificates. As a result, other children of CWE-295 can be regarded as children of CWE-599 as well. CWE's use of one-dimensional hierarchical relationships is not well-suited to handle different kinds of abstraction relationships based on concepts like types of resources ("OpenSSL certificate" as a child of "any certificate") and types of behaviors ("not validating expiration" as a child of "improper validation").






## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

### Extended Description
In security-relevant contexts, even small variations in timing can be exploited by attackers to indirectly infer certain details about the product's internal operations. For example, in some cryptographic algorithms, attackers can use timing differences to infer certain properties about a private key, making the key easier to guess. Timing discrepancies effectively form a timing side channel.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-203
CanPrecede -> CWE-385
CanPrecede -> CWE-327

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Often primary in cryptographic applications and algorithms.

**[Maintenance]** CWE 4.16 removed a demonstrative example for a hardware module because it was inaccurate and unable to be adapted. The CWE team is developing an alternative.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-10071:** Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies
- **CVE-2019-10482:** Smartphone OS uses comparison functions that are not in constant time, allowing side channels
- **CVE-2014-0984:** Password-checking function in router terminates validation of a password entry when it encounters the first incorrect character, which allows remote attackers to obtain passwords via a brute-force attack that relies on timing differences in responses to incorrect password guesses, aka a timing side-channel attack.




## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Overflow: "Stack Overflow" is often used to mean the same thing as stack-based buffer overflow, however it is also used on occasion to mean stack exhaustion, usually a result from an excessively recursive function call. Due to the ambiguity of the term, use of stack overflow to describe either circumstance is discouraged.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-788
ChildOf -> CWE-787

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Stack-based buffer overflows can instantiate in return address overwrites, stack pointer overwrites or frame pointer overwrites. They can also be considered function pointer overwrites, array indexer overwrites or write-what-where condition, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-35395:** Stack-based buffer overflows in SFK for wifi chipset used for IoT/embedded devices, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.

### Extended Description
This typically occurs when the pointer or its index is incremented to a position beyond the bounds of the buffer or when pointer arithmetic results in a position outside of the valid memory location to name a few. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-125
ChildOf -> CWE-788

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** These problems may be resultant from missing sentinel values (CWE-463) or trusting a user-influenced input length variable.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-1733:** Text editor has out-of-bounds read past end of line while indenting C code
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated, leading to buffer over-read or heap-based buffer overflow.




## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.

### Extended Description
This can allow the actor to perform actions more frequently than expected. The actor could be a human or an automated process such as a virus or bot. This could be used to cause a denial of service, compromise program logic (such as limiting humans to a single vote), or other consequences. For example, an authentication routine might not limit the number of times an attacker can guess a password. Or, a web site might conduct a poll but only expect humans to vote a maximum of once a day.

### Alternative Terms
Insufficient anti-automation: The term "insufficient anti-automation" focuses primarly on non-human actors such as viruses or bots, but the scope of this CWE entry is broader.
Brute force: Vulnerabilities that can be targeted using brute force attacks are often symptomatic of this weakness.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-691

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
