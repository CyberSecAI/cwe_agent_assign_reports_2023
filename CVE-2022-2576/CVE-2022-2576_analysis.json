This CWE is a Base level CWE, providing a good balance between specificity and generality.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe408[\"CWE-408: Incorrect Behavior Order: Early Amplification\"]\n    cwe405[\"CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\"]\n    cwe696[\"CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order\"]\n    \n    cwe408 -->|CHILDOF| cwe405\n    cwe408 -->|CHILDOF| cwe696\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe408 primary\n    class cwe405,cwe696 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **DTLS resumption handshake falls back to a DTLS full handshake on a parameter mismatch**. This leads to the **missing HelloVerifyRequest during fallback**, which results in **message amplification** and **high CPU load**, ultimately causing a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the server's failure to perform a `HelloVerifyRequest` during a full handshake fallback on session resumption attempts with mismatched parameters. This missing check allows an attacker to force the server into expensive full handshakes, leading to resource exhaustion and amplification attacks.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference links supports this analysis:\n\n*   **Vulnerability Description:** \"DTLS resumption handshake falls back to a DTLS full handshake on a parameter mismatch without using a HelloVerifyRequest...that results in message amplification (DDoS other peers) and high CPU load (DoS own peer).\"\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** \"The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) implementation of Eclipse Californium...the server incorrectly falls back to a full handshake without performing a stateless cookie exchange using a HelloVerifyRequest. This bypass of the cookie exchange mechanism is the root cause.\"\n\nThe graph relationships and retriever results also influenced the final selection. CWE-408 (Incorrect Behavior Order: Early Amplification) was identified as the best match due to the server performing an expensive operation (full handshake) before proper authentication (HelloVerifyRequest). The MITRE mapping guidance allows for the use of CWE-408 as it is at the Base level of abstraction.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This CWE was considered, but is not as good a fit as CWE-408, since it does not capture the specific issue of early amplification.*\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This CWE was considered, but is a Class level CWE.*\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This CWE was considered, but is a Class level CWE.*\n\n## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTwo separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was considered, but it is not the primary weakness.*\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was considered, but it is not the primary weakness.*\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This CWE was considered, but it is not the primary weakness.*\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was considered, but it is not the primary weakness.*\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
