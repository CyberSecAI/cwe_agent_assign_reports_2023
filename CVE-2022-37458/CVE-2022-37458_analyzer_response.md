# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2022-37458

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-799 | Improper Control of Interaction Frequency | 0.9 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE |
| CWE-307 | Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-799, is a Class-level CWE, which suggests the possibility of a more specific Base-level child CWE. CWE-307 is a child of CWE-799 and represents a more specific case of **improper control of interaction frequency** related to authentication attempts. Since the vulnerability involves sending unlimited email invitations, which could be considered a type of interaction, both CWEs are relevant.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient rate limiting** of email invitations in the Discourse software. This leads to the ability for admins to send invitations to arbitrary email addresses at an unlimited rate, ultimately resulting in email spam and potential phishing attacks.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment, based on the provided evidence, points to CWE-799 (Improper Control of Interaction Frequency) as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly indicate that the Discourse software **fails to properly limit the rate at which admins can send email invitations**. This aligns with the description of CWE-799, which states that "the product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor."

However, given that the **improper control of interaction frequency** specifically relates to sending invitations, and that the invitations are sent via email and can be unlimited, CWE-307 (Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts) is a closely related candidate. While not strictly an authentication attempt, the unlimited invitation sending could be seen as a form of resource exhaustion and abuse of the invitation system.

The final decision is to assign CWE-799 as the primary CWE, given its direct match to the core issue of **improperly controlling the interaction frequency** of sending invitations. CWE-307 is included as a secondary candidate because it focuses on a specific type of interaction (authentication attempts) but is still relevant as a more granular perspective.

The selection of CWE-799 as the primary CWE is based on the following evidence:

*   **Vulnerability Description:** "Discourse through 2.8.7 allows admins to send invitations to arbitrary email addresses at an unlimited rate."
*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** "The core issue is the **lack of sufficient rate limiting** on email invitations, allowing a malicious user to send a large volume of invitations in a short period."

The abstraction level of CWE-799 (Class) is appropriate because it captures the general weakness. While CWE-307 (Base) is more specific, the vulnerability is not strictly related to authentication. Therefore, keeping CWE-799 as the primary allows for a broader understanding of the weakness.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.

## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges 
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities
