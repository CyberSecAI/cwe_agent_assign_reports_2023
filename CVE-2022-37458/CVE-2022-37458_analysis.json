CWE-307 is a child of CWE-799 and represents a more specific case of **improper control of interaction frequency** related to authentication attempts. Since the vulnerability involves sending unlimited email invitations, which could be considered a type of interaction, both CWEs are relevant.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe799[\"CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\"]\n    cwe307[\"CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts\"]\n    \n    cwe307 -->|CHILDOF| cwe799\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe799 primary\n    class cwe307 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient rate limiting** of email invitations in the Discourse software. This leads to the ability for admins to send invitations to arbitrary email addresses at an unlimited rate, ultimately resulting in email spam and potential phishing attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the provided evidence, points to CWE-799 (Improper Control of Interaction Frequency) as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly indicate that the Discourse software **fails to properly limit the rate at which admins can send email invitations**. This aligns with the description of CWE-799, which states that \"the product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor.\"\n\nHowever, given that the **improper control of interaction frequency** specifically relates to sending invitations, and that the invitations are sent via email and can be unlimited, CWE-307 (Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts) is a closely related candidate. While not strictly an authentication attempt, the unlimited invitation sending could be seen as a form of resource exhaustion and abuse of the invitation system.\n\nThe final decision is to assign CWE-799 as the primary CWE, given its direct match to the core issue of **improperly controlling the interaction frequency** of sending invitations. CWE-307 is included as a secondary candidate because it focuses on a specific type of interaction (authentication attempts) but is still relevant as a more granular perspective.\n\nThe selection of CWE-799 as the primary CWE is based on the following evidence:\n\n*   **Vulnerability Description:** \"Discourse through 2.8.7 allows admins to send invitations to arbitrary email addresses at an unlimited rate.\"\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** \"The core issue is the **lack of sufficient rate limiting** on email invitations, allowing a malicious user to send a large volume of invitations in a short period.\"\n\nThe abstraction level of CWE-799 (Class) is appropriate because it captures the general weakness. While CWE-307 (Base) is more specific, the vulnerability is not strictly related to authentication. Therefore, keeping CWE-799 as the primary allows for a broader understanding of the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
