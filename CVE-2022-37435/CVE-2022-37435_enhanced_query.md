# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-269 is commonly misused. It can be conflated with "privilege escalation," which is a technical impact that is listed in many low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis.
**Comments:** If an error or mistake allows privilege escalation, then use the CWE ID for that mistake. Avoid using CWE-269 when only phrases such as "privilege escalation" or "gain privileges" are available, as these indicate technical impact of the vulnerability - not the root cause weakness. If the root cause seems to be directly related to privileges, then examine the children of CWE-269 for additional hints, such as Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250) or Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266).
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-1555:** Terminal privileges are not reset when a user logs out.
- **CVE-2001-1514:** Does not properly pass security context to child processes in certain cases, allows privilege escalation.
- **CVE-2001-0128:** Does not properly compute roles.




## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.

### Extended Description
When a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-285
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which "permissions" are not checked, which is an "authorization" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].
**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.
- **CVE-2009-3482:** Anti-virus product sets insecure "Everyone: Full Control" permissions for files under the "Program Files" folder, allowing attackers to replace executables with Trojan horses.
- **CVE-2009-3897:** Product creates directories with 0777 permissions at installation, allowing users to gain privileges and access a socket used for authentication.




## CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
Opening temporary files without appropriate measures or controls can leave the file, its contents and any function that it impacts vulnerable to attack.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-377

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24823:** A network application framework uses the Java function createTempFile(), which will create a file that is readable by other local users of the system

## CWE-620: Unverified Password Change
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When setting a new password for a user, the product does not require knowledge of the original password, or using another form of authentication.

### Extended Description
This could be used by an attacker to change passwords for another user, thus gaining the privileges associated with that user.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2007-0681:** Web app allows remote attackers to change the passwords of arbitrary users without providing the original password, and possibly perform other unauthorized actions.
- **CVE-2000-0944:** Web application password change utility doesn't check the original password.




## CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product performs an operation at a privilege level that is higher than the minimum level required, which creates new weaknesses or amplifies the consequences of other weaknesses.

### Extended Description


New weaknesses can be exposed because running with extra privileges, such as root or Administrator, can disable the normal security checks being performed by the operating system or surrounding environment. Other pre-existing weaknesses can turn into security vulnerabilities if they occur while operating at raised privileges.


Privilege management functions can behave in some less-than-obvious ways, and they have different quirks on different platforms. These inconsistencies are particularly pronounced if you are transitioning from one non-root user to another. Signal handlers and spawned processes run at the privilege of the owning process, so if a process is running as root when a signal fires or a sub-process is executed, the signal handler or sub-process will operate with root privileges.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-269
ChildOf -> CWE-657

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** There is a close association with CWE-653 (Insufficient Separation of Privileges). CWE-653 is about providing separate components for each privilege; CWE-250 is about ensuring that each component has the least amount of privileges possible.

**[Maintenance]** CWE-271, CWE-272, and CWE-250 are all closely related and possibly overlapping. CWE-271 is probably better suited as a category. Both CWE-272 and CWE-250 are in active use by the community. The "least privilege" phrase has multiple interpretations.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2007-4217:** FTP client program on a certain OS runs with setuid privileges and has a buffer overflow. Most clients do not need extra privileges, so an overflow is not a vulnerability for those clients.
- **CVE-2008-1877:** Program runs with privileges and calls another program with the same privileges, which allows read of arbitrary files.
- **CVE-2007-5159:** OS incorrectly installs a program with setuid privileges, allowing users to gain privileges.




## CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product creates a temporary file in a directory whose permissions allow unintended actors to determine the file's existence or otherwise access that file.

### Extended Description
On some operating systems, the fact that the temporary file exists may be apparent to any user with sufficient privileges to access that directory. Since the file is visible, the application that is using the temporary file could be known. If one has access to list the processes on the system, the attacker has gained information about what the user is doing at that time. By correlating this with the applications the user is running, an attacker could potentially discover what a user's actions are. From this, higher levels of security could be breached.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-377

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-27818:** A hotkey daemon written in Rust creates a domain socket file underneath /tmp, which is accessible by any user.
- **CVE-2021-21290:** A Java-based application for a rapid-development framework uses File.createTempFile() to create a random temporary file with insecure default permissions.




## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-285
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-453: Insecure Default Variable Initialization
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product, by default, initializes an internal variable with an insecure or less secure value than is possible.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1188

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This overlaps other categories, probably should be split into separate items.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-36349:** insecure default variable initialization in BIOS firmware for a hardware board allows DoS
