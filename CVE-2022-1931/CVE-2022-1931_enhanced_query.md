### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Incorrect Synchronization**
- **product:** polonel/trudesk
- **version:** prior to 1.2.3

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The commit message "fix(messages): validation check" and the changes in the `src/controllers/api/v1/messages.js` file indicate a fix related to message handling. Specifically, there was an issue with how the message owner was being assigned, leading to a potential inconsistency or error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Owner Assignment:** In the original code, the message owner was being overwritten. The code was first trying to find the user based on the provided `owner` ID, and then assigning the `owner` field of the new message object using `owner: owner,`. It was then immediately overwritten with the user ID fetched from database in a later step by `owner: user._id`. This indicates a logic error in how the message object was being created.
- **Potential for Logic Errors:** The code was using `convo.save` within the findOneAndUpdate callback, which could result in unexpected behavior if the save operation was not successful and cause issues with the update process, indicated by the `if (convo === null || convo === undefined)` block.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Message Corruption/Inconsistency**: Due to the incorrect owner assignment, messages might be associated with the wrong users or not be delivered/stored correctly. This can lead to confusion, miscommunication, or data loss. 
- **Potential for other unforeseen issues**: The issues with updating the conversation and saving it may have resulted in other errors or inconsistencies in the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending messages through the application's messaging interface.
- Any user with the capability of sending messages in the application could trigger the vulnerability, although no specific attack is detailed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be a valid user within the application with the ability to send messages within the system's chat/messaging functionality.

**Additional Notes:**
- The commit primarily focused on correcting the message owner assignment and seems to have fixed a logic error related to how users and messages were linked.
- The `src/public/js/pages/messages.js` file has changes primarily related to refactoring and modernizing the javascript, along with a fix for an issue with detecting if the user is typing, and other small fixes that do not seem related to the core messaging error.
- The changes in `src/client/containers/Tickets/TicketsContainer.jsx` appears to be a small, unrelated change and does not appear to be part of the vulnerability described.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-821: Incorrect Synchronization
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product utilizes a shared resource in a concurrent manner, but it does not correctly synchronize access to the resource.

### Extended Description
If access to a shared resource is not correctly synchronized, then the resource may not be in a state that is expected by the product. This might lead to unexpected or insecure behaviors, especially if an attacker can influence the shared resource.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms. Multiple entries are dependent on this research, which includes relationships to concurrency, race conditions, reentrant functions, etc. CWE-662 and its children - including CWE-667, CWE-820, CWE-821, and others - may need to be modified significantly, along with their relationships.






## CWE-648: Incorrect Use of Privileged APIs
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not conform to the API requirements for a function call that requires extra privileges. This could allow attackers to gain privileges by causing the function to be called incorrectly.

### Extended Description


When a product contains certain functions that perform operations requiring an elevated level of privilege, the caller of a privileged API must be careful to:


  - ensure that assumptions made by the APIs are valid, such as validity of arguments

  - account for known weaknesses in the design/implementation of the API

  - call the API from a safe context

If the caller of the API does not follow these requirements, then it may allow a malicious user or process to elevate their privilege, hijack the process, or steal sensitive data.

For instance, it is important to know if privileged APIs do not shed their privileges before returning to the caller or if the privileged function might make certain assumptions about the data, context or state information passed to it by the caller. It is important to always know when and how privileged APIs can be called in order to ensure that their elevated level of privilege cannot be exploited.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2003-0645:** A Unix utility that displays online help files, if installed setuid, could allow a local attacker to gain privileges when a particular file-opening function is called.




## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Resources that may contain sensitive data include documents, packets, messages, databases, etc. While this data may be useful to an individual user or small set of users who share the resource, it may need to be removed before the resource can be shared outside of the trusted group. The process of removal is sometimes called cleansing or scrubbing.


For example, a product for editing documents might not remove sensitive data such as reviewer comments or the local pathname where the document is stored. Or, a proxy might not remove an internal IP address from headers before making an outgoing request to an Internet site.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This entry is intended to be different from resultant information leaks, including those that occur from improper buffer initialization and reuse, improper encryption, interaction errors, and multiple interpretation errors. This entry could be regarded as a privacy leak, depending on the type of information that is leaked.

**[Relationship]** There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).

**[Terminology]** The terms "cleansing" and "scrubbing" have multiple uses within computing. In information security, these are used for the removal of sensitive data, but they are also used for the modification of incoming/outgoing data so that it conforms to specifications.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release
- **CVE-2005-0406:** Some image editors modify a JPEG image, but the original EXIF thumbnail image is left intact within the JPEG. (Also an interaction error).
- **CVE-2002-0704:** NAT feature in firewall leaks internal IP addresses in ICMP error messages.




## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Unrestricted File Upload: Used in vulnerability databases and elsewhere, but it is insufficiently precise. The phrase could be interpreted as the lack of restrictions on the size or number of uploaded files, which is a resource consumption issue.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

This can have a chaining relationship with incomplete denylist / permissive allowlist errors when the product tries, but fails, to properly limit which types of files are allowed (CWE-183, CWE-184).


This can also overlap multiple interpretation errors for intermediaries, e.g. anti-virus products that do not remove or quarantine attachments with certain file extensions that can be processed by client systems.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-5227:** PHP-based FAQ management app does not check the MIME type for uploaded images
- **CVE-2001-0901:** Web-based mail product stores ".shtml" attachments that could contain SSI
- **CVE-2002-1841:** PHP upload does not restrict file types




## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.

### Extended Description


Synchronization refers to a variety of behaviors and mechanisms that allow two or more independently-operating processes or threads to ensure that they operate on shared resources in predictable ways that do not interfere with each other. Some shared resource operations cannot be executed atomically; that is, multiple steps must be guaranteed to execute sequentially, without any interference by other processes. Synchronization mechanisms vary widely, but they may include locking, mutexes, and semaphores. When a multi-step operation on a shared resource cannot be guaranteed to execute independent of interference, then the resulting behavior can be unpredictable. Improper synchronization could lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.

**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**

- **CVE-2009-0935:** Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice




## CWE-820: Missing Synchronization
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product utilizes a shared resource in a concurrent manner but does not attempt to synchronize access to the resource.

### Extended Description
If access to a shared resource is not synchronized, then the resource may not be in a state that is expected by the product. This might lead to unexpected or insecure behaviors, especially if an attacker can influence the shared resource.

## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

### Extended Description


This could allow an attacker to access or modify system files or other files that are critical to the application.


Path manipulation errors occur when the following two conditions are met:

```
		1. An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.
		2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.
```
For example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker.

**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** CWE-114 is a Class, but it is listed a child of CWE-73 in view 1000. This suggests some abstraction problems that should be resolved in future versions.

**[Relationship]** 

The external control of filenames can be the primary link in chains with other file-related weaknesses, as seen in the CanPrecede relationships. This is because software systems use files for many different purposes: to execute programs, load code libraries, to store application data, to store configuration settings, record temporary data, act as signals or semaphores to other processes, etc.


However, those weaknesses do not always require external control. For example, link-following weaknesses (CWE-59) often involve pathnames that are not controllable by the attacker at all.


The external control can be resultant from other issues. For example, in PHP applications, the register_globals setting can allow an attacker to modify variables that the programmer thought were immutable, enabling file inclusion (CWE-98) and path traversal (CWE-22). Operating with excessive privileges (CWE-250) might allow an attacker to specify an input filename that is not directly readable by the attacker, but is accessible to the privileged program. A buffer overflow (CWE-119) might give an attacker control over nearby memory locations that are related to pathnames, but were not directly modifiable by the attacker.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)
- **CVE-2008-5748:** Chain: external control of values for user's desired language and theme enables path traversal.
- **CVE-2008-5764:** Chain: external control of user's target language enables remote file inclusion.




## CWE-574: EJB Bad Practices: Use of Synchronization Primitives
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product violates the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) specification by using thread synchronization primitives.

### Extended Description
The Enterprise JavaBeans specification requires that every bean provider follow a set of programming guidelines designed to ensure that the bean will be portable and behave consistently in any EJB container. In this case, the product violates the following EJB guideline: "An enterprise bean must not use thread synchronization primitives to synchronize execution of multiple instances." The specification justifies this requirement in the following way: "This rule is required to ensure consistent runtime semantics because while some EJB containers may use a single JVM to execute all enterprise bean's instances, others may distribute the instances across multiple JVMs."

### Alternative Terms

**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use






## CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition.

### Extended Description


Race conditions frequently occur in signal handlers, since signal handlers support asynchronous actions. These race conditions have a variety of root causes and symptoms. Attackers may be able to exploit a signal handler race condition to cause the product state to be corrupted, possibly leading to a denial of service or even code execution.


These issues occur when non-reentrant functions, or state-sensitive actions occur in the signal handler, where they may be called at any time. These behaviors can violate assumptions being made by the "regular" code that is interrupted, or by other signal handlers that may also be invoked. If these functions are called at an inopportune moment - such as while a non-reentrant function is already running - memory corruption could occur that may be exploitable for code execution. Another signal race condition commonly found occurs when free is called within a signal handler, resulting in a double free and therefore a write-what-where condition. Even if a given pointer is set to NULL after it has been freed, a race condition still exists between the time the memory was freed and the pointer was set to NULL. This is especially problematic if the same signal handler has been set for more than one signal -- since it means that the signal handler itself may be reentered.


There are several known behaviors related to signal handlers that have received the label of "signal handler race condition":


  - Shared state (e.g. global data or static variables) that are accessible to both a signal handler and "regular" code

  - Shared state between a signal handler and other signal handlers

  - Use of non-reentrant functionality within a signal handler - which generally implies that shared state is being used. For example, malloc() and free() are non-reentrant because they may use global or static data structures for managing memory, and they are indirectly used by innocent-seeming functions such as syslog(); these functions could be exploited for memory corruption and, possibly, code execution.

  - Association of the same signal handler function with multiple signals - which might imply shared state, since the same code and resources are accessed. For example, this can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.

  - Use of setjmp and longjmp, or other mechanisms that prevent a signal handler from returning control back to the original functionality

  - While not technically a race condition, some signal handlers are designed to be called at most once, and being called more than once can introduce security problems, even when there are not any concurrent calls to the signal handler. This can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.

Signal handler vulnerabilities are often classified based on the absence of a specific protection mechanism, although this style of classification is discouraged in CWE because programmers often have a choice of several different mechanisms for addressing the weakness. Such protection mechanisms may preserve exclusivity of access to the shared resource, and behavioral atomicity for the relevant code:

  - Avoiding shared state

  - Using synchronization in the signal handler

  - Using synchronization in the regular code

  - Disabling or masking other signals, which provides atomicity (which effectively ensures exclusivity)

## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.

### Extended Description
When the length value exceeds the size of the destination, a buffer overflow could occur.
