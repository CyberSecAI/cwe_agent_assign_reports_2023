While it has potential Base-level children, the provided information doesn't give specifics to select a more specific CWE. CWE-862 is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), indicating a broader context of access control issues. CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is a Base-level CWE and is related to resource management issues, specifically the absence of limits on resource allocation. It is a child of CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284,cwe400 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing permission check** (CWE-862), which directly leads to a local denial of service. The missing check allows unauthorized access, and if resources aren't properly managed (potentially CWE-770), the denial of service impact is more likely.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points to CWE-862 due to the explicit mention of a **missing permission check** in the vulnerability description. The description states: \"In messaging service, there is a **missing permission check**. This could lead to local denial of service in contacts service with no additional execution privileges needed.\"\n\nThe \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section lists CWE-862 as the Primary CWE Match. The retriever results also list CWE-862 as the top combined result. This evidence solidifies the selection of CWE-862.\n\nCWE-770 was considered as a secondary factor because a **missing permission check** leading to a denial of service could imply that resources are being allocated without limits or throttling, but this is not explicitly stated in the description.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity based on the available evidence. While CWE-862 is a Class, the description does not provide enough information to determine which of its children would be a better fit.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected.
