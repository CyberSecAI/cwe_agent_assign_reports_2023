The description indicates **improper input validation**, which is directly covered by CWE-20. However, the impact is memory corruption, which could be a consequence of an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). I am listing both CWEs because the root cause is **improper input validation**, but the consequence points to a memory corruption issue like CWE-787.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    cwe190 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n    class cwe190 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20) which then leads to corrupt memory mapping, potentially through an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates **improper input validation**, which could lead to corrupt memory mapping.\n\nThe primary assessment is CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) since the description explicitly mentions **improper input validation** as the root cause. However, CWE-20 is discouraged.\n\nThe impact of the vulnerability is memory corruption which can be caused by many different types of errors.\n\nThe CWE for similar CVE descriptions also lists CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as the primary CWE match.\n\nBased on the provided information, I'm choosing CWE-20 as the primary cause, but recognizing that the impact is likely memory corruption. I am also including CWE-787 as a secondary candidate based on the impact of memory corruption and the CWE for similar CVE descriptions.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25
