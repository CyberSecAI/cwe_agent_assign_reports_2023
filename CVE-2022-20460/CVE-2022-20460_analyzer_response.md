# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2022-20460

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.8 | Class | Primary | Discouraged |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.5 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship impacting my decision is that CWE-20 is a Class-level CWE, while CWE-787 is a Base-level CWE. The description indicates **improper input validation**, which is directly covered by CWE-20. However, the impact is memory corruption, which could be a consequence of an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). I am listing both CWEs because the root cause is **improper input validation**, but the consequence points to a memory corruption issue like CWE-787.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20) which then leads to corrupt memory mapping, potentially through an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description indicates **improper input validation**, which could lead to corrupt memory mapping.

The primary assessment is CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) since the description explicitly mentions **improper input validation** as the root cause. However, CWE-20 is discouraged.

The impact of the vulnerability is memory corruption which can be caused by many different types of errors.

The CWE for similar CVE descriptions also lists CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as the primary CWE match.

Based on the provided information, I'm choosing CWE-20 as the primary cause, but recognizing that the impact is likely memory corruption. I am also including CWE-787 as a secondary candidate based on the impact of memory corruption and the CWE for similar CVE descriptions.
