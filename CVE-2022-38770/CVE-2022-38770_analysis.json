This indicates a hierarchical relationship where the vulnerability is a specific type of incorrect authorization within the broader context of improper access control. The choice of CWE-639 is preferred because it is at the Base level of abstraction, offering greater specificity compared to its parent classes.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe639 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe284,cwe287 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a successful login, followed by an authorization **bypass** due to **user-controlled key**, which then enables fetching other users' data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered several CWEs related to authentication and authorization, but the presence of a **bypass** using a **user-controlled key** strongly suggests CWE-639 as the most fitting classification. This is because the vulnerability's description explicitly states that attackers can fetch other users' data upon a successful login request, indicating an authorization **bypass** rather than a complete lack of authorization. The retriever results also list CWE-639 as a potential candidate.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"The mobile application in Transtek Mojodat FAM (Fixed Asset Management) 2.4.6 allows remote attackers to fetch other users data upon a successful login request.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section confirms this by stating: \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect access control in the mobile application\" and \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application allows remote attackers to fetch other users' data upon a successful login request.\" This further supports that the application's access control mechanism is flawed.\n\nCWE-639 is at the optimal level of specificity because it precisely describes the scenario where authorization **bypass** occurs through manipulation of a **user-controlled key**, leading to unauthorized data access. Other CWEs considered, such as CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), are more general and do not capture the specific mechanism of exploitation. CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is less relevant because the attacker has already successfully authenticated.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
