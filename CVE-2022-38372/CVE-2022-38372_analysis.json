The other CWEs considered were related to privilege management, command injection, or general authorization issues, but they did not directly address the presence of **hidden functionality [CWE-1242]**. CWE-1242 is a base level CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1242[\"CWE-1242: Inclusion of Undocumented Features or Chicken Bits\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe1242 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1242 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of:\n  1. **Root Cause**: **Hidden functionality [CWE-1242]** (undocumented command) is present in the FortiTester CLI.\n  2. **Exploitation**: A local privileged user exploits this **hidden functionality [CWE-1242]** by executing the undocumented command.\n  3. **Impact**: The user obtains a root shell on the device.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which the description clearly states as a **hidden functionality [CWE-1242]** issue. The evidence is strong, with explicit mentions in both the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary.\n\nThe vulnerability description states \"A **hidden functionality vulnerability [CWE-1242]** in FortiTester CLI... may allow a local, privileged user to obtain a root shell on the device via an undocumented command.\"\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary states \"Root cause of vulnerability: A hidden functionality vulnerability exists in FortiTester CLI. An undocumented shell command allows a local, privileged user to obtain a root shell.\"\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-1242 is related to access control issues (CWE-284), but the core problem is the existence of the **hidden functionality [CWE-1242]** itself.\n\nThe selected CWE-1242 is at the optimal level of specificity, directly addressing the presence of **hidden functionality [CWE-1242]** or \"chicken bits\" as the root cause, as specified in the CWE description. Other CWEs considered, such as those related to privilege management or command injection, are not as directly relevant as they describe potential consequences or related issues but not the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1242: Inclusion of Undocumented Features or Chicken Bits\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.420\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe device includes chicken bits or undocumented features that can create entry points for unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-912: Hidden Functionality\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.296\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains functionality that is not documented, not part of the specification, and not accessible through an interface or command sequence that is obvious to the product's users or administrators.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.258\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an operation at a privilege level that is higher than the minimum level required, which creates new weaknesses or amplifies the consequences of other weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.255\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-269 is commonly misused.
