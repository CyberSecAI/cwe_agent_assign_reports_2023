The graph shows that CWE-226 is a ChildOf CWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer), which in turn can lead to CWE-200 (Information Exposure). However, there is not enough information to be more specific than CWE-200.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n    cwe226[\"CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\"]\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n\n    cwe226 -->|CHILDOF| cwe212\n    cwe212 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe226 secondary\n    class cwe212 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is:\n1.  **Root Cause:** The specific root cause is not evident from the vulnerability description.\n2.  **Weakness:** Information Disclosure\n3.  **Impact:** Sensitive information is exposed.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates an \"Information Disclosure Vulnerability\" within the Windows Kernel.\n\nThe primary match from \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" is CWE-NVD-noinfo, which is not a true CWE. The top CWEs include CWE-668 (Incorrect Permission Assignment) and CWE-362 (Race Condition), but these are not directly supported by the description.\n\nThe **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** lists the **impact** as Information Disclosure.\n\nThe retriever results suggest several CWEs, including CWE-226, CWE-909, CWE-665, and CWE-362. CWE-226 (Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse) is a base-level CWE, but there isn't enough evidence to confirm this is the actual root cause. CWE-200 (Information Exposure) is a Class-level CWE, which is the most appropriate level given the information available. I am choosing this CWE because the vulnerability description directly states Information Disclosure.\n\nCWE-200 is preferred over CWE-NVD-noinfo, because CWE-NVD-noinfo is not a real CWE.\n\nI also considered CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information) and CWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer), but neither is a close match.\n\nI am selecting CWE-200 with a confidence of 0.7 due to the limited information available. I will also include CWE-226 (Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse) with a confidence of 0.6 as a potential root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-200: Information Exposure\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nAn information exposure (or information leakage) vulnerability occurs when sensitive information is unintentionally exposed to an actor that is not authorized to have it.\n\n### Extended Description\n\nThis can take many forms:\n\n*   A web site reveals credit card numbers in the clear.\n*   A program stores passwords in a world-readable file.\n*   A program reveals portions of its memory, such as by failing to clear a buffer before providing it to another program.\n*   A program reveals its source code or internal configuration to unauthorized users.\n\nInformation exposure can lead to a variety of negative consequences, including identity theft, financial loss, damage to reputation, and legal liability.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nInformation Leak\nInformation Leakage\n\n### Relationships\nParentOf: CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\nParentOf: CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n### Potential Mitigations\n\n#### Phase: Implementation\nEnsure that sensitive information is not stored in clear text.
