It has child CWEs like CWE-23 (Relative Path Traversal) and CWE-36 (Absolute Path Traversal). CWE-22 can precede CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path). The secondary CWE is CWE-288, which describes authentication bypass using an alternate path or channel.

This vulnerability stems from a list of folders that are incorrectly included in a 'bypass list' for authentication.\" It also states, \"**Path Traversal**: The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authentication by using directory traversal sequences (e.g., `..%2f`) in the URL...**Improper Access Control**: The vulnerability also highlights a failure to properly restrict access to sensitive resources via the web interface.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-22 is based on the explicit mention of **path traversal** as the root cause. The selection of CWE-288 is based on the impact which is **authentication bypass**, and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section supports this.\n\nCWE-22 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the **improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory**. CWE-288 is also at a good level of specificity as it highlights that the **authentication bypass** is happening because of an alternate path.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-23 (Relative Path Traversal): While related, CWE-22 is broader and more appropriate as the description doesn't specifically mention relative path traversal.\n*   CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path): While the path is controlled externally, the core issue is the traversal itself, making CWE-22 more suitable.\n*   CWE-287 (Improper Authentication): This is a class-level CWE and is too general. The vulnerability is specifically an **authentication bypass** due to a **path traversal**, making CWE-288 more appropriate.\n*   CWE-284 (Improper Access Control): This is a pillar-level CWE and is too general. The specific weakness is **path traversal** leading to **authentication bypass**.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
