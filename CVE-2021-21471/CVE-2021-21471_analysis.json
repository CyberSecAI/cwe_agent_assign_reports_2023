CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) are children of CWE-284, representing more specific types of access control issues. CWE-863 is a Class, and CWE-639 is a Base, the most specific of the three.

An authenticated user exploits this to access API endpoints not intended for them, potentially impacting the application's integrity.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitial Analysis:\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly points to **improper access control**, as evidenced by the key phrase \"**improper access control**\" and the summary: \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control. Authenticated users can access API endpoints that are not intended for them.\"\n\nThe Retriever Results list CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) as the top candidate. However, the mapping guidance for CWE-284 discourages its use due to its high-level nature. It suggests considering more specific descendants.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) are also strong candidates, offering more specific classifications of the **improper access control**.\n\nCWE-639 more closely fits the description of an authenticated user bypassing authorization to access another user's data by manipulating keys. However, the description doesn't explicitly mention key manipulation, so it's a slightly less confident match than CWE-863.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\n\nGiven the guidance against using the high-level CWE-284, it is still selected, since it's the best match for the root cause, but more specific CWEs will also be selected.\nCWE-863 is included as a secondary CWE because it represents a more specific form of **improper access control**, namely an incorrect authorization check.\n\nCWE-639 is also considered as a secondary CWE due to the possibility of the authenticated user exploiting the API via user-controlled keys.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at a good level of specificity. While more specific CWEs might exist, they would require assumptions not directly supported by the provided information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-284: Improper Access Control\n**Abstraction:** Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.247 (sparse)\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-284 is extremely high-level, a Pillar. Its name, \"Improper Access Control,\" is often misused in low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287] or by active use of the OWASP Top Ten, such as \"A01:2021-Broken Access Control\". It is not useful for trend analysis.\n**Comments:** Consider using descendants of CWE-284 that are more specific to the kind of access control involved, such as those involving authorization (Missing Authorization (CWE-862), Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863), Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource (CWE-732), etc.); authentication (Missing Authentication (CWE-306) or Weak Authentication (CWE-1390)); Incorrect User Management (CWE-286); Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints (CWE-923); etc.\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.244 (sparse)\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.238 (sparse)\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.",
