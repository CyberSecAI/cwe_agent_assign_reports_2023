CWE-415 is related to CWE-416 (Use After Free) as a peer. These two are often caused by similar underlying issues in memory management. Both are children of CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference) and CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiration).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe415[\"CWE-415: Double Free\"]\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource after Expiration\"]\n    \n    cwe415 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe415 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe415 -- PEEROF --> cwe416\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe415 primary\n    class cwe416 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper implementation of the Value class's default assignment operator** in Jsonxx, which leads to a **shallow copy of pointer members**. This, in turn, causes multiple `Value` objects to point to the same memory. When these objects are destructed, the same memory is freed multiple times (CWE-415) or is used after being freed (CWE-416). The final impact is memory corruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-415 (Double Free) as the primary candidate based on the vulnerability description and the provided information. The **weakness** is explicitly described as \"**double free or use after free**\" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause involves multiple `Value` objects pointing to the same memory, resulting in memory being freed multiple times during object destruction. The retriever results also list CWE-415 as a highly relevant CWE.\n\nCWE-416 (Use After Free) is considered a secondary candidate because the vulnerability description mentions both \"double free or use after free\". Since both weaknesses are possible outcomes of the same root cause, it is appropriate to include both.\n\nThe selection of CWE-415 and CWE-416 is at the Variant level, providing a specific representation of the **weakness**. The evidence strongly supports these classifications, and the relationship analysis confirms their relevance.\n\nThe retriever scores support this decision, with CWE-415 having a high score. The vulnerability description key phrases highlight \"**double free or use after free**\" as the **weakness**, which directly aligns with the descriptions of these CWEs.\n\nRelevant CWE
