It directly addresses the **missing permission check** described in the vulnerability. While CWE-862 is a Class, the provided evidence does not point to a more specific Base or Variant, making it the most appropriate choice.\n\nCWE-862 is a child of CWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**) and CWE-284 (**Improper Access Control**). These parent CWEs are broader, covering general authorization and access control issues. CWE-862 is more specific, focusing on the absence of an authorization check.\n\nCWE-269 (**Improper Privilege Management**) and CWE-250 (**Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**) are also considered as secondary candidates because of the privilege escalation impact.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    cwe250[\"CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe269 -->|PEEROF| cwe862\n    cwe250 -->|PEEROF| cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe269,cwe250 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission check** (CWE-862), which leads to a local escalation of privilege.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment is based on the vulnerability description that explicitly states a \"**missing permission check**\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the root cause is a \"Missing permission check in Bluetooth\" and also specifies \"CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management\" as a weakness.\n\nThe retriever results suggest CWE-862 (**Missing Authorization**) as the top candidate. Given the root cause evidence \"**missing permission check**\" and the direct impact of \"escalation of privilege\", CWE-862 is a strong fit.\n\nCWE-269 (**Improper Privilege Management**) is also relevant, as the vulnerability leads to privilege escalation, but the root cause is the **missing check**, making CWE-862 the more precise mapping. CWE-250 (**Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**) is less directly applicable, as there's no specific indication that the code is running with unnecessary privileges beyond the **missing permission check**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is at the Class level, as the available information does not allow for a more specific Base or Variant mapping.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information\n- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.\n- **CVE-2009-3597:** Web application stores database file under the web root with insufficient access control (CWE-219), allowing direct request.",
