CWE-209 can also precede CWE-600 (Uncaught Exception in Servlet) which means that an uncaught exception in a servlet can result in an error message. The relationship analysis reinforces the selection of CWE-209 as it provides a direct and specific classification for the vulnerability described.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n    cwe600[\"CWE-600: Uncaught Exception in Servlet\"]\n\n    cwe209 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe600 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe209\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe209 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe600 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with a remote attacker triggering a **detailed technical error message**, leading to the **generation of an error message containing sensitive information (CWE-209)**, and culminating in the **attacker obtaining sensitive information**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis confirms the selection of CWE-209 as the primary CWE for this vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly states that a **detailed technical error message** allows a remote attacker to **obtain sensitive information**. This directly aligns with the description of CWE-209, which involves the **generation of an error message containing sensitive information**. The \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section also lists CWE-209 as the primary match. The retriever results also list CWE-209 as the best match.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description and the supporting information from the retriever results. CWE-209 is selected as it is at the optimal level of specificity, providing a direct and accurate classification of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 4968.93\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 4883.58\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-3",
