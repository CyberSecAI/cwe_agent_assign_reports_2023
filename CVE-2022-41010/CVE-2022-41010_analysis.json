CWE-120 is a `BASE` CWE and a child of CWE-119 as well.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe120 secondary\n    class cwe787,cwe119,cwe123 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **stack-based buffer overflow** (CWE-121), which is caused by using `sprintf` without proper bounds checking when parsing `DetranCLI` commands. This leads to the ability to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified a **stack-based buffer overflow**. The evidence provided clearly indicates a buffer overflow on the stack due to the use of `sprintf` without proper bounds checking.\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states \"Several **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerabilities exist in the DetranCLI command parsing functionality\".\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section says \"The root cause is a **stack-based buffer overflow**\" and \"The vulnerability is a classic **stack-based buffer overflow** (CWE-120) caused by using `sprintf` without proper bounds checking.\"\n\nCWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) is the most accurate and specific CWE.\nCWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')) is also relevant because the `sprintf` function copies data into a buffer without checking the size of the input.\nI am selecting CWE-121 as the primary because it is a `VARIANT` and more specific than CWE-120, which is a `BASE`.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n...\n## CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives a complex input with multiple elements or fields that must be consistent with each other, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually consistent.\n...\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n...\n## CWE-606: Unchecked Input for Loop Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly check inputs that are used for loop conditions, potentially leading to a denial of service or other consequences because of excessive looping.\n...\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n...\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive -
