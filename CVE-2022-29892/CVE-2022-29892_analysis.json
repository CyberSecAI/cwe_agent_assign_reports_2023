The retriever results suggested more specific base-level CWEs such as CWE-1284 and CWE-1286, children of CWE-20, but the evidence is not granular enough to confirm which *type* of input validation is missing, so CWE-20 is used. CWE-400 can result from improper input validation. CWE-400 is a class-level CWE with discouraged usage because it is often misused and a more specific CWE could be identified.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    cwe1286[\"CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\"]\n    \n    cwe1284 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe1286 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n    class cwe1284,cwe1286 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper input validation** (CWE-20). This leads to repeatedly displaying errors which results in the final impact of denial-of-service (DoS). CWE-400 describes the final impact and it is CANPRECEDE by CWE-20.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **improper input validation** as the root cause, leading to a denial-of-service. The retriever results pointed to more specific CWEs related to input validation, such as CWE-1284 and CWE-1286. However, the provided evidence only states \"**improper input validation**\" without specifying the type. Therefore, selecting CWE-20 is appropriate because it directly reflects the documented root cause. The vulnerability description indicates a DoS, which can be mapped to CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, as the repeated errors likely consume resources.\n\n*Vulnerability Description Key Phrases*:\n- **rootcause:** **Improper input validation**\n- **impact:** denial-of-service (DoS)\n\n*CVE Reference Links Content Summary*:\n- The root cause is an \"**Improper input validation**\" vulnerability in the Space functionality of Cybozu Garoon.\n- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-20, which indicates a failure to properly validate user-supplied input. Specifically, the application does not perform adequate checks on user input within the Space feature.\n- A successful exploit of this vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. An attacker can repeatedly trigger errors in certain functions of the application.\n\nCWE-20 is at the optimal level of specificity because the type of input that is not validated is not known.",
