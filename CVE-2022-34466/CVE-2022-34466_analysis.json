The vulnerability is caused by **expression injection** due to **improper neutralization**. |\n| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability leads to leakage of sensitive information. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-917, which is a Base level CWE. It is related to CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) as a ChildOf. CWE-917 represents the specific case of expression language injection, which aligns well with the vulnerability description. CWE-200 represents the impact of the vulnerability where sensitive information is exposed.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe917[\"CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe917 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe917 -->|IMPACT| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe917 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **expression injection** (CWE-917), which allows a malicious user to **leak sensitive information** (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-917, **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')**. This is based on the vulnerability description stating an **expression injection** vulnerability exists. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also mentions this as the **root cause of the vulnerability**. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section also mentions **expression injection** as a root cause.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"An **expression injection** vulnerability was discovered in the Workflow subsystem of Mendix Runtime, that can affect the running applications. The vulnerability could allow a malicious user to **leak sensitive information** in a certain configuration.\"\n\nCWE-917 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The \"Retriever Results\" also lists CWE-917 as the top combined result.\n\nCWE-200, **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**, is included as a secondary CWE because the impact of the **expression injection** is the leakage of sensitive information. However, CWE-200 is a Class level CWE and is often misused, as it represents the impact rather than the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 7773.95\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].",
