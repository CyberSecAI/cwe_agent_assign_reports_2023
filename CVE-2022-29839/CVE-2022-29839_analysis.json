It is a child of CWE-1390 [CWE-1390: Weak Authentication], CWE-287 [CWE-287: Improper Authentication], and CWE-668 [CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere]. These relationships show that insufficient protection of credentials can stem from broader authentication or resource exposure issues. CWE-256 [CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password] and CWE-523 [CWE-523: Unprotected Transport of Credentials] are Base-level CWEs and children of CWE-522 [CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials].

The evidence supporting this is: \"**Insufficiently Protected Credentials** vulnerability in the remote backups application on Western Digital My Cloud devices that could allow an attacker who has gained access to a relevant endpoint to use that information to access protected data.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section further confirms this by stating that the \"**root cause of vulnerability**\" is \"**Insufficient protection of credentials** in the Remote Backups application\" and that \"**Credentials** for the remote backups application are **not encrypted**.\"\n\nGiven that the credentials are not encrypted, CWE-256 [CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password] was considered as a candidate to further classify the vulnerability. Because it is unclear whether the credentials were in transit or at rest, I selected both CWE-256 [CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password] and CWE-523 [CWE-523: Unprotected Transport of Credentials] as secondary mappings.\n\nCWE-522 [CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials] is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the **weakness** identified in the vulnerability description. The evidence supports this, and while more specific details about the nature of the insufficient protection could further refine the mapping, the provided information is best captured by CWE-522 [CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials], CWE-256 [CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password], and CWE-523 [CWE-523: Unprotected Transport of Credentials].\n\n**CWEs Considered but Not Used:**\n\n*   **CWE-22 [CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')]**: While listed in the Retriever Results, this CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability is about credential protection, not path manipulation.\n*   **CWE-668 [CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere]**: While a parent of CWE-522 [CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials], it's too high-level and doesn't specifically address the credential protection issue.\n*   **CWE-287 [CWE-287: Improper Authentication]**: Also a parent of CWE-522 [CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials], it's too broad as the issue is not about failing to authenticate but about **insufficiently protecting** existing credentials.\n*   **CWE-306 [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function]**: Not relevant as the vulnerability is about **insufficiently protected credentials**, not a complete lack of authentication.\n*   **CWE-73 [CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path]**: Not relevant because the vulnerability is about credential protection, not external control of file paths.\n*   **CWE-697 [CWE-697: Incorrect Comparison]**: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability is not related to incorrect comparisons.\n*   **CWE-1289 [CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input]**: Not relevant because the vulnerability is about credential protection, not input validation.\n*   **CWE-1391 [CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials]**: While related to credentials, the primary issue is not the **weakness** of the credentials themselves but their **insufficient protection**.\n*   **CWE-1390 [CWE-1390: Weak Authentication]**: While related to authentication, it's too broad.
