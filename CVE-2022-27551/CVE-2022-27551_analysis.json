It's a child of CWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**) and CWE-284 (**Improper Access Control**), indicating a hierarchical relationship. While CWE-863 offers more specificity than its parents, there could be even more specific Base-level CWEs that describe the exact flaw in the authorization check.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively simple:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper security checking** leads to\n2.  **Weakness:** **Incorrect Authorization** (CWE-863)\n3.  **Impact:** An authenticated user can obtain sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and its corresponding CWE. The vulnerability description mentions \"**improper security checking**,\" leading to sensitive information disclosure for authenticated users.\n\nThe Retriever Results suggested several CWEs, including CWE-322 (**Key Exchange without Entity Authentication**), CWE-284 (**Improper Access Control**), CWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**), and CWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**).\n\nCWE-284 (**Improper Access Control**) is a Pillar-level CWE and too high-level. CWE-322 (**Key Exchange without Entity Authentication**) does not fit the description of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**) and CWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**) were considered, as they directly relate to authorization issues. CWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**) is a Class-level CWE and is more general, indicating the absence or incorrect implementation of an authorization check. CWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**) is also a Class-level CWE but more specific, indicating that an authorization check is performed but incorrectly. Given the description focuses on \"**improper security checking**\", I believe CWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**) is a better fit.\n\nThe evidence is limited, as the description only provides a high-level overview of the vulnerability. However, the \"**improper security checking**\" phrase strongly suggests an issue with authorization.\n\nTherefore, the final assessment is that CWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**) is the most appropriate CWE at the optimal level of specificity given the available information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.

However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
