CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400, providing a more specific classification by focusing on the allocation of resources without limits. This hierarchical structure helped refine the CWE selection from the more general \"Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\" to the more specific \"Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling.\"\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe774[\"CWE-774: Allocation of Excessive Resources\"]\n    cwe1325[\"CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe770 -->|PARENTOF| cwe789\n    cwe770 -->|PARENTOF| cwe774\n    cwe770 -->|PARENTOF| cwe1325\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n    \n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper handling of internal resources** leading to resource exhaustion and finally resulting in a denial-of-service condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, CWE-400 \"Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\" was considered as the primary CWE due to the **improper handling of internal resources** which leads to a denial-of-service condition. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly mentions \"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\". However, the MITRE mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-400 because it is often misused and conflated with the \"technical impact\" of vulnerabilities.\n\nConsidering the discouragement of CWE-400 and the specific nature of the vulnerability, the analysis shifted towards identifying a more specific CWE. The vulnerability involves **improper handling of internal resources**, which means resources are allocated without proper limits or throttling. Therefore, CWE-770 \"Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\" was considered as a secondary CWE, as it provides a more precise description of the **root cause**.\n\nThe final decision is to classify this vulnerability primarily as CWE-400, with secondary classification as CWE-770. This decision acknowledges the general resource consumption issue while also highlighting the specific allocation issue. This multi-faceted approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability. The selection of CWE-770 offers a more specific base level identification of the **root cause**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is

does not properly check inputs that are used for loop conditions, potentially leading to a denial of service or other consequences because of excessive looping.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a

Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual
