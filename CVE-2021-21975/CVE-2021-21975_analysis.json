It has parent-child relationships with CWE-441 (Unintended Proxy or Intermediary) and CWE-610 (Insufficiently Protected Internal Assets). There is also a peer relationship between CWE-918 and CWE-611 (Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference), as both can involve outbound requests to unexpected destinations.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe441[\"CWE-441: Unintended Proxy or Intermediary\"]\n    cwe610[\"CWE-610: Insufficiently Protected Internal Assets\"]\n    cwe611[\"CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\"]\n    \n    cwe918 -->|CHILDOF| cwe441\n    cwe918 -->|CHILDOF| cwe610\n    cwe918 --|PEEROF| cwe611\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe918 primary\n    class cwe441,cwe610,cwe611 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Server Side Request Forgery** (**CWE-918**) vulnerability in the vRealize Operations Manager API, allowing a malicious actor with network access to perform an attack that leads to the theft of administrative credentials.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis concludes that **CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery)** is the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability.\n\nThe \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section explicitly mentions \"**rootcause:** **server-side request forgery**\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section further confirms this by stating \"The vRealize Operations Manager API contains a **Server Side Request Forgery vulnerability**\" and lists \"**Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**\" under \"Weaknesses.\" This provides direct evidence supporting the selection of CWE-918.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-918 as the top combined result.\n\nThe alternative CWEs considered, such as CWE-601 (URL Redirection to Untrusted Site) and CWE-611 (Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference), were not as fitting because the vulnerability is specifically described as a Server Side Request Forgery, involving the server making requests to unintended destinations. While CWE-611 shares similarities, the SSRF nature points directly to CWE-918.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level according to the mapping guidance. This provides a specific and actionable classification for the vulnerability.",
