While CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) is also a child of CWE-200 and a peer of CWE-209, the evidence more strongly supports the generation of an error message containing the sensitive path, rather than the general insertion of sensitive information into sent data.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n    \n    cwe209 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe209 -- CANALSOBE --> cwe201\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe209 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **weakness** where the application **fails to properly** handle errors when deleting deck card attachments, leading to the **exposure** of the full application path in the error message.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information) because the vulnerability description and CVE reference links clearly indicate that the application **exposes** its full path in an error message due to **improper** error handling during the deletion of deck card attachments.\n\nThe evidence includes:\n\n*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** \"**weakness:** **full path exposure**\"\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** \"This error inadvertently **exposes** the full application path to unauthorized users.\"\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** \"Information **Exposure**: The application leaks sensitive information by disclosing its full path in error responses related to deleting attachments.\"\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** \"Lack of proper error handling: The system returns detailed exception information, including the application path, instead of a generic error message.\"\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** \"The fix for this vulnerability involves suppressing exception details in the API response and returning a generic error message with a request ID for logging purposes.\"\n\nCWE-209's description aligns perfectly: \"The product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\"\n\nCWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) was considered because the full path is being sent in the error message. However, CWE-209 is more specific as it directly addresses the generation of error messages containing sensitive information, making it a better fit.\n\nI am confident in this assessment due to the clear evidence and direct applicability of CWE-209.",
