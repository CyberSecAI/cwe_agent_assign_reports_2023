This indicates that the **infinite recursion** leads to a loop that never terminates. CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) is considered as a secondary CWE because **heap-use-after-free** could lead to dereferencing a NULL pointer.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe835[\"CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')\"]\n    cwe834[\"CWE-834: Excessive Iteration\"]\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n    \n    cwe835 -->|CHILDOF| cwe834\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe835 primary\n    class cwe834,cwe476 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a malformed packet causing **infinite recursion** within the CMS dissector, leading to a denial-of-service. A possible result of this **heap-use-after-free** is a NULL Pointer Dereference.\n  - The root cause is the malformed packet processed by the CMS dissector.\n  - The primary weakness is **infinite recursion**.\n  - The impact is denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment was guided by the primary CWE match of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) for similar CVE descriptions. However, the retriever results and the description of the vulnerability indicate that the **infinite recursion** (CWE-835) is a more appropriate primary weakness. The vulnerability description key phrases also highlights the **infinite recursion** as a weakness. The provided evidence is that the CMS dissector crashes due to **infinite recursion**.\n> **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**\n> -   **weakness:** **infinite recursion**\n\nThe analysis concludes that CWE-835 is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability, as it directly addresses the **infinite recursion** caused by the malformed packet. CWE-476 is included as a possible secondary issue because of the **heap-use-after-free** condition.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as
