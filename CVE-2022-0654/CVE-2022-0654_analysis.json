CWE-212 is related as it represents a failure to remove sensitive information before transfer, which can lead to CWE-201. The abstraction levels guided the selection of CWE-201 as the most specific and relevant base-level CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe212 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe201\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe212 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of sensitive information**, specifically the \"Cookie\" and \"Authorization\" headers. This leads to the **insertion of sensitive information into sent data** (CWE-201) during redirects to external domains, resulting in the **exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed towards CWE-200 due to the \"**Exposure of Sensitive Information**\" impact. However, analyzing the root cause reveals that the vulnerability stems from the library forwarding sensitive headers during redirects without proper sanitization. This aligns more precisely with CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data), as the **sensitive information** is actively being included in the data being sent. The description of CWE-201 states: \"The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes **sensitive information** that should not be accessible to that actor.\" The fix implemented confirms this, as it introduces a `sanitizeHeaders` function to remove these headers before redirection. This is direct evidence.\n\nThe relationship graph also supports this. CWE-201 is a child of CWE-200, meaning it's a more specific case. The description clearly indicates the **insertion** aspect, pushing it towards CWE-201.\n\nCWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer) was also considered, as the headers are not being properly removed before being sent. This is a valid, secondary consideration.\n\nCWE-200 is discouraged as a primary mapping due to being too general, and is more of an impact than a root cause.\n\nI am confident in this assessment because the vulnerability description, CVE reference links, and retriever results all point towards the active insertion of sensitive data, making CWE-201 the most accurate and specific classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available.
