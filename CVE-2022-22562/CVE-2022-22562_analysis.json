CWE-410, a potential secondary weakness, can precede CWE-400 (Resource Exhaustion), illustrating a possible chain of events.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe230[\"CWE-230: Improper Handling of Missing Values\"]\n    cwe229[\"CWE-229: Improper Handling of Multiple Data Elements Separately\"]\n    cwe410[\"CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Resource Exhaustion\"]\n    \n    cwe230 -->|CHILDOF| cwe229\n    cwe410 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe230 primary\n    class cwe410 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of missing values** (CWE-230), which can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The missing values could potentially cause resource exhaustion (CWE-400) if the resource pool is insufficient (CWE-410).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **improper handling of missing values** which leads to a denial-of-service.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states \"**improper handling of missing values**\" as the root cause, which aligns directly with CWE-230's description: \"The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when a parameter, field, or argument name is specified, but the associated value is missing, i.e. it is empty, blank, or null.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating: \"**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** - Improper handling of missing values.\" This direct match and supporting evidence give high confidence in assigning CWE-230.\n\nCWE-410 (Insufficient Resource Pool) is considered as a secondary candidate because **improper handling of missing values** could lead to resource exhaustion if the system is not designed to handle such cases, but this is an inference rather than explicitly stated in the description. It is possible that handling the missing values incorrectly could lead to a state where resources are not released properly, or too many resources are requested, thus exhausting the pool.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-230 as the top combined result.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
