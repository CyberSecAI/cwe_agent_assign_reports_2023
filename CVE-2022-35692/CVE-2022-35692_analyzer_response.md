# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2022-35692

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.5 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the decision is the parent-child relationship between CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). CWE-862 is a more specific type of improper authorization where authorization checks are completely missing. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a potential impact of the missing authorization, where sensitive information is exposed due to the lack of access control. I chose CWE-862 because the description explicitly says that the vulnerability is due to **Improper Access Control**, and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary says "**Root cause of vulnerability: Improper Authorization**"

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check (CWE-862). This leads to a security feature bypass and the potential exposure of sensitive user account details (CWE-200).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment, based on the description, indicated an **Improper Access Control** issue. The retriever results suggested several CWEs, including CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). The final decision to select CWE-862 as the primary CWE was driven by the fact that the system completely **lacked authorization checks**. While CWE-285 is a parent, it's less specific. CWE-863 implies that there *is* an authorization check that is done incorrectly, which isn't supported by the evidence.

The vulnerability description states: "Adobe Commerce versions 2.4.3-p2 (and earlier), 2.3.7-p3 (and earlier) and 2.4.4 (and earlier) are affected by an **Improper Access Control** vulnerability that could result in a Security feature bypass. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to leak minor information of another users account detials. Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction."
Also, the CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: "**Root cause of vulnerability: Improper Authorization**"

CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was considered as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability leads to leaking minor information of another user's account details. However, it's more of an impact than a root cause.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-862 accurately describes the root cause, while CWE-200 describes the potential impact.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected:* This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not related to resource management.

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not related to sensitive information remaining in a resource after reuse.

## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.

*Not Selected:* This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not related to the overall control of a resource.

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected:* This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not related to locking mechanisms.

## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.

*Not Selected:* This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not about handling insufficient privileges. It is about a missing authorization check.

## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not related to the granularity of the access control, but rather a complete lack of an access control check.

## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not related to isolation or compartmentalization.

## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* Similar to CWE-274, this is about how the system handles *insufficient* privileges, not the *lack* of privilege checks.

## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This
