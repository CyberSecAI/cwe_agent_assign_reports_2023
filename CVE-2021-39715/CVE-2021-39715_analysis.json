It has child CWEs like CWE-201 and CWE-226 that are more specific and related to how the information is exposed. CWE-201 relates to inserting sensitive information into sent data, and CWE-226 concerns sensitive information not being cleared before reuse. The choice of CWE-200 is justified because the core issue is about exposing sensitive information, but the specifics of how this happens could potentially fall under CWE-201 or CWE-226, providing additional context.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe226[\"CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\"]\n    \n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe226 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe201,cwe226 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the logging mechanism in the `show_regs` function. The **improper formatting** and handling of memory dumps lead to the **exposure of sensitive kernel memory and addresses**. This **information disclosure** can then be used by an attacker to further compromise the system. The chain is:\n1. **Improper formatting during memory dumps** in `show_regs` (Implicit Weakness)\n2. **Information Disclosure** (CWE-200)\n3. **Kernel Memory and Address Leak** (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **log information disclosure** in the `show_regs` function. The provided evidence clearly points to an information exposure issue, making CWE-200 the most appropriate primary classification. The vulnerability description key phrases highlight \"**log information disclosure**\" as the root cause, and the CVE reference links content summary confirms that the **improper formatting** of memory dumps leads to the exposure of sensitive data.\n\nThe retriever results also support this, with CWE-200 being the top combined result. While CWE-200 is a Class, its usage is Discouraged because it's often misused. However, in this case, the evidence directly supports the exposure of sensitive information due to improper handling of memory dumps in logs.\n\nOther CWEs considered include CWE-201 and CWE-226. CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) could apply if the logging mechanism explicitly inserts sensitive data into the logs. CWE-226 (Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse) might be relevant if the memory being dumped contains sensitive information that should have been cleared. These are included as secondary to give more context to the vulnerability's mechanics.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause and contributing factors of the vulnerability, based on the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
