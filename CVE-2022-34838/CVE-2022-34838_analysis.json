This indicates that the vulnerability is a specific case of storing credentials in an insecure manner.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe257[\"CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe257 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe257 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Storing passwords in a recoverable format** (CWE-257)\n2.  **Impact:** An attacker may add or alter data points and corresponding attributes, leading to altered data visualization for the end user.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence and the relationships between CWEs. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the **root cause** is \"**storing passwords in recoverable format**\". This maps directly to CWE-257 (Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format). The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-257 as the most relevant CWE.\n\nThe evidence is \"**rootcause:** **storing passwords in recoverable format**\" from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section.\n\nThe relationship analysis supports selecting CWE-257 as a specific base-level weakness, rather than a more general class.\n\nThe selected CWE, CWE-257, is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the **root cause** identified in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users. In fact, it should be noted that recoverable encrypted passwords provide no significant benefit over plaintext passwords since they are subject not only to reuse by malicious attackers but also by malicious insiders. If a system administrator can recover a password directly, or use a brute force search on the available information, the administrator can use the password on other accounts.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\nCWE-321 was considered because it appeared in the retriever results, but it was not selected because the vulnerability description focuses on passwords, not cryptographic keys.\n\n## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\nCWE-256 was considered because it appeared in the retriever results, but it was not selected because the vulnerability description focuses on passwords that are recoverable, implying some form of encryption (however weak) is in use.\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\nCWE-916 was considered because it appeared in the retriever results, but it was not selected because there is no specific evidence that a hash is used, or that the computational effort is insufficient. The vulnerability description is about passwords being recoverable, not about the strength of the hashing algorithm.\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\nCWE-23 was not considered because the vulnerability description does not involve path manipulation or file access.\n\n## CWE-620: Unverified Password Change\nCWE-620 was considered because it appeared in the retriever results, but it was not selected because the vulnerability description does not describe changing a password without verification.\n\n## CWE-640: Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password\nCWE-640 was considered because it appeared in the retriever results, but it was not selected because the vulnerability description is not specific to password recovery mechanisms.\n\n## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\nCWE-522 was considered as a potential parent CWE, but the description focuses on a specific type of credential storage and the use of CWE-522 would not be specific enough.\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\nCWE-328 was considered because it appeared in the retriever results, but it was not selected because there is no specific evidence that a weak hash is used.\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\nCWE-798 was considered because it appeared in the retriever results, but it was not selected because there is no specific evidence that credentials were hard-coded. The vulnerability description is about passwords being recoverable.",
