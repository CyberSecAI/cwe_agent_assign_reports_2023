However, CWE-359 provides more specific context regarding the exposure of private personal information, making it a more appropriate choice than its parent. There aren't strong chain relationships to consider. The analysis focuses on selecting the most descriptive base CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe359 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively simple:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper** access control allows a project member to filter issues by contact and organization, which they should not be authorized to do.\n2.  **Weakness:** **Exposure of Private Personal Information** to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-359).\n3.  **Impact:** Unauthorized filtering of issues by contact and organization.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the ability of a project member to filter issues by contact and organization. The evidence clearly indicates that this results in the exposure of private personal information to an unauthorized actor. CWE-359 directly addresses this scenario.\n\nThe **Vulnerability Description** states that a \"project member\" was **allowed** to filter issues by contact and organization, which directly relates to access of personal information by an unauthorized actor.\n\nThe selection of CWE-359 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the vulnerability's core issue: the exposure of private personal information. While other CWEs like CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) were considered, they were deemed too general compared to the specific privacy violation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
