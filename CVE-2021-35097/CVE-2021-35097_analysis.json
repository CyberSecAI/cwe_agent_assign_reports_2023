Although CWE-302 addresses authentication bypass, CWE-347 better captures the root cause. Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction. There are child of relationships to CWE-345 and CWE-807 for CWE-347 and CWE-302, respectively.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe302[\"CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    cwe807[\"CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\"]\n    \n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    cwe302 -->|CHILDOF| cwe807\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe302 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper order of signature verification and hashing**, leading to a failure to properly authenticate, which results in an authentication bypass.\n  - Root cause: **improper order of signature verification and hashing**\n  - Weakness: Failure to properly authenticate\n  - Impact: Authentication Bypass\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **improper order of signature verification and hashing** as the root cause of the authentication bypass. The retriever results suggested CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature) and CWE-302 (Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data).\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions the \"**improper order of signature verification and hashing**\" which directly relates to the core concept of CWE-347. The description of CWE-347 states: \"The product does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.\" This aligns perfectly with the provided vulnerability description.\n\nCWE-302, while related to the impact (authentication bypass), doesn't directly address the **root cause** of the **improper signature verification process**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-347 is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description and its strong alignment with the CWE's definition. This provides a more specific and accurate representation of the weakness than CWE-302.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
