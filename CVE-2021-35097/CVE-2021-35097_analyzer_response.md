# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2021-35097

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-347 | Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-302 | Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the decision is that CWE-347 is a more direct match for the **improper signature verification** described in the vulnerability. Although CWE-302 addresses authentication bypass, CWE-347 better captures the root cause. Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction. There are child of relationships to CWE-345 and CWE-807 for CWE-347 and CWE-302, respectively.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper order of signature verification and hashing**, leading to a failure to properly authenticate, which results in an authentication bypass.
  - Root cause: **improper order of signature verification and hashing**
  - Weakness: Failure to properly authenticate
  - Impact: Authentication Bypass

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on the **improper order of signature verification and hashing** as the root cause of the authentication bypass. The retriever results suggested CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature) and CWE-302 (Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data).

The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the "**improper order of signature verification and hashing**" which directly relates to the core concept of CWE-347. The description of CWE-347 states: "The product does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data." This aligns perfectly with the provided vulnerability description.

CWE-302, while related to the impact (authentication bypass), doesn't directly address the **root cause** of the **improper signature verification process**.

The selection of CWE-347 is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description and its strong alignment with the CWE's definition. This provides a more specific and accurate representation of the weakness than CWE-302.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.

## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
