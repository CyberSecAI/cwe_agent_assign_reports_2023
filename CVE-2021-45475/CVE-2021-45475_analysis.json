While CWE-200 is a broader class, CWE-497 provides a more specific description that aligns better with the vulnerability description, focusing on system-level information. The abstraction levels also influenced selection, favoring the Base level (CWE-497) over the Class level (CWE-200) for greater specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe497 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively simple. The **lack of authentication** for accessing the system leads directly to the **exposure of sensitive information**. There are no explicit prerequisites mentioned beyond the existence of sensitive system information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability description indicates an **information disclosure** vulnerability in the Yordam Library Information Document Automation product before version 19.02, which is accessible to an **unauthenticated attacker**.\n\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere). This selection is based on the vulnerability description, which specifically mentions \"Information disclosure,\" and the fact that the product exposes this information to an **unauthenticated attacker**, which aligns with the concept of an \"Unauthorized Control Sphere\". The description of CWE-497 states: \"The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\" This aligns well with the unauthenticated access leading to information disclosure.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was also considered, but it is a more general class. While the vulnerability does involve exposing sensitive information, the specificity of CWE-497, focusing on \"system-level\" information, makes it a better fit. Furthermore, the mapping guidance for CWE-200 discourages its use as it is often misused and suggests considering more specific children.\n\nThe decision is based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description's mention of \"**unauthenticated** Information disclosure\" and the alignment of CWE-497's description with this scenario. The graph relationships highlight that CWE-497 is a child of CWE-200, further supporting the choice of the more specific CWE-497. The confidence level is 0.7 due to the lack of more detailed information on the nature of the disclosed information. If the disclosed information was more specific (e.g., passwords, cryptographic keys), a different CWE might be more appropriate.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-497 directly addresses the **exposure of sensitive system information** to **unauthorized actors**, a scenario explicitly described in the vulnerability. While other CWEs might be related (e.g., those related to authentication bypass), CWE-497 captures the core weakness of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-776: Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses XML documents and allows their structure to be defined with a Document Type Definition (DTD), but it does not properly control the number of recursive definitions of entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
