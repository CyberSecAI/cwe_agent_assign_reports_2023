This reflects the specific nature of the buffer overflow occurring on the stack.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **stack overflow** condition in the `setIpPortFilterRules` function. The `sPort/ePort` parameters cause a buffer overflow on the stack. This leads to the potential for arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that there is an authenticated **stack overflow** in the `setIpPortFilterRules` function due to the `sPort/ePort` parameter.\n\nThe Retriever Results identify CWE-121 as the top candidate with a score of 1.0.\nCWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) is a Variant of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), which aligns with the nature of the vulnerability.\n\nThe description mentions that the stack overflow is in the `setIpPortFilterRules` function due to the `sPort/ePort` parameter. This is sufficient evidence to assign CWE-121 as the primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-35395:** Stack-based buffer overflows in SFK for wifi chipset used for IoT/embedded devices, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\nCWE-190, CWE-78, CWE-674, CWE-125, CWE-790, CWE-128, CWE-120, CWE-770 and CWE-1284 were considered but are not a fit because the description specifically says stack overflow which is best represented by CWE-121.",
