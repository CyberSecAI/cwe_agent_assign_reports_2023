CWE-257 is a peer that focuses on storing passwords in a recoverable format, which is a contributing factor in this vulnerability. Both CWEs are at the Base level, providing sufficient specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe257[\"CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe257 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe257 -->|PEEROF| cwe798\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe497 primary\n    class cwe257 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **storage of SNMP credentials in a recoverable format (CWE-257)**. This leads to the **exposure of sensitive system information (CWE-497)** when the device **prints SNMP credentials** on the serial port during boot. The **printing of SNMP credentials** leads to an unauthorized actor being able to gain access to the credentials.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the fact that the device **prints SNMP credentials** on the serial port during boot. The summary of the CVE reference link indicates that the **root cause** is that the \"Airspan AirVelocity 1500 device exposes sensitive information via an RS232 serial console (DBG port). Specifically, during the boot process, the device prints the contents of the `/bsdata/snmpd.conf` file, which contains plaintext SNMP credentials\". This aligns with CWE-497 because the device does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors. This is further supported by the vulnerability description key phrases which mentions the **weakness** is that it **prints SNMP credentials**. The `Retriever Results` also point to `CWE-497 Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere` as a candidate CWE, further strengthening the case.\n\nI considered CWE-522, `Insufficiently Protected Credentials`, but this is more about how credentials are transmitted or stored and is a class level CWE. Since the serial port is physically accessible, the root cause is more about exposing the credentials than how they are protected.\n\nI am also adding CWE-257, `Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format`, to account for the fact that the credentials were stored in plaintext.\n\nThese selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they address both the exposure and storage aspects of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
