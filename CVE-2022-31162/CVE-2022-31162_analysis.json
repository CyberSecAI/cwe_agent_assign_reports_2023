It is a child of both CWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer) and CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor). The vulnerability description strongly aligns with CWE-1258 because it involves the leakage of OAuth client details in application debug logs due to insufficient sanitization. CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) is considered as a secondary candidate because the sensitive information is being written to a log file. CWE-200 is a class-level CWE and is discouraged as per the MITRE mapping guidance.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1258[\"CWE-1258: Exposure of Sensitive System Information Due to Uncleared Debug Information\"]\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n\n    cwe1258 -->|CHILDOF| cwe212\n    cwe1258 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1258 primary\n    class cwe532,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** of **leak of sensitive information** in application debug logs due to insufficient sanitization. This leads to the impact of potential exposure of Slack OAuth client information. The root cause is the **improper** handling of debug information for OAuth secrets, which results in the exposure of sensitive data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **leak of sensitive information** in debug logs. The Retriever Results suggested CWE-1258 as the top candidate, which aligns with the vulnerability description. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of debug output, leading to the exposure of OAuth secrets. The graph relationships show that CWE-1258 is a child of CWE-200 and CWE-212, providing a hierarchical context for the weakness. The MITRE mapping guidance recommends using base-level CWEs, which further supports the selection of CWE-1258. The evidence from the vulnerability description, combined with the relationship analysis and mapping guidance, confirms that CWE-1258 is the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
