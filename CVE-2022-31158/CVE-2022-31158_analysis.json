It has a ChildOf relationship to CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication). CWE-330 is a Class level CWE, and the mapping guidance suggests that children of this entry should be examined to see if there is a better fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe294[\"CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\"]\n    cwe330[\"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    cwe804[\"CWE-804: Guessable CAPTCHA\"]\n    \n    cwe294 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe294 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe330 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe330 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe804\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe294 primary\n    class cwe330 secondary\n    class cwe1390,cwe287,cwe693,cwe804 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** of the **nonce claim value was not validated against nonce value**. This leads to an **Improper Authentication** issue, which can then allow for **Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment indicated that the **nonce claim value was not validated against nonce value**, resulting in a potential for authentication bypass. The retriever results suggested CWE-294 (Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay) as the top candidate, followed by CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values).\n\nThe selection of CWE-294 is supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states that the root cause is the **nonce claim value was not being validated against the nonce value** and the impact of exploitation is that it could potentially allow an attacker to bypass authentication. This aligns well with the description of CWE-294: \"A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).\"\n\nCWE-330 was considered because the use of a nonce is intended to provide a unique, unpredictable value. If the nonce isn't validated, it's possible the value itself may not be sufficiently random. However, the description focuses on the **lack of validation**, not the quality of the random number generation itself. Therefore, CWE-294 is the more appropriate choice.\n\nThe selection of CWE-294 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability: the **lack of validation** of the nonce, which allows for potential replay attacks. This is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-1289 was not selected as it is more general than CWE-294. The vulnerability is specific to authentication bypass.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\nCWE-74 was not selected as the vulnerability does not involve injection of special elements.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-807 was not selected as the vulnerability is more specific to the **lack of validation** of the nonce value in the authentication process.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-184 was not selected as the vulnerability does not involve an incomplete list of disallowed inputs.\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\nCWE-799 was not selected as the vulnerability does not involve improper control of interaction frequency.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names.
