This is a child of CWE-119, which is a broader class describing improper restriction of operations within memory buffers. However, since the description specifically mentions a read operation, CWE-125 is a more precise fit. CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is included as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability stems from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which is the root cause. CWE-129 is considered since the improper input is related to an array index.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe129[\"CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\"]\n    \n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe125\n    cwe129 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe125\n    cwe129 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe20,cwe129 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (CWE-20), leading to an **improper validation of the array index** (CWE-129) which results in an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125). The impact of this out-of-bounds read is the disclosure of sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-125 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of a \"read past the end of an allocated array.\" The vulnerability description key phrases also support this finding.\n\nThe analysis was refined to include CWE-20 because the root cause lies in the **\"lack of proper validation of user-supplied data\"**. While CWE-20 is a class-level CWE and discouraged for use, the vulnerability description clearly states the **lack of proper validation** as the root cause.\n\nThe inclusion of CWE-129 provides further specificity, as the user-supplied data is used as an array index.\n\nThe final selection represents a balance between specificity (CWE-125, CWE-129) and root cause identification (CWE-20). The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity based on the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE does not apply because the issue is not related to privilege handling.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
