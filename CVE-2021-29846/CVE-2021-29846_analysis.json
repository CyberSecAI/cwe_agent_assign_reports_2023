It has child relationships to CWE-672 (Operation on a Resource after Expiration or Release). This confirms that session expiration issues can lead to further problems by allowing operations after the session should no longer be valid. There are no other relationships that are relevant to the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe613[\"CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on a Resource after Expiration or Release\"]\n    \n    cwe672 -->|CHILDOF| cwe613\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe613 primary\n    class cwe672 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient session expiration** (CWE-613), which leads to the impact of an authenticated user being able to obtain sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly suggests CWE-613 (Insufficient Session Expiration) as the primary CWE.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states \"**insufficient session expiration**\" as the **rootcause**, which directly aligns with the definition of CWE-613. The impact is that an authenticated user can obtain sensitive information.\n\nThe Retriever Results list CWE-613 as the top result with a score of 0.300. The CWE specification for CWE-613 states that it is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The Mapping Guidance Usage is \"Allowed\".\n\nTherefore, CWE-613 is the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not implement sufficient measures to prevent multiple failed authentication attempts within a short time frame.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
