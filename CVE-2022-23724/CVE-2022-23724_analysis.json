CWE-798 is a child of CWE-1391, indicating that using hard-coded credentials is a specific type of using weak credentials. The hierarchical relationship helps to understand the context of the vulnerability, and the variant level of CWE-321 is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1391\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe321 primary\n    class cwe798 secondary\n    class cwe1391 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of static encryption key material** (CWE-321), which leads to the ability to forge authentication tokens, ultimately bypassing MFA and potentially compromising other users.\n- The **rootcause** is the **use of static encryption key material** (CWE-321).\n- The impact is the ability to forge authentication tokens and bypass MFA.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the **rootcause** phrase \"**Use of static encryption key material**\" from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section. This directly aligns with CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key), which describes a scenario where a product uses a hard-coded cryptographic key, increasing the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered. The relationships between CWE-321, CWE-798, and CWE-1391 helped to refine the selection to the most specific and accurate CWE.\n\nCWE-321 is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **use of static encryption key material**, which directly corresponds to the description of CWE-321.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n- CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials): While related, it's a broader category. CWE-321 is more specific as it involves cryptographic keys.\n- CWE-1391 (Use of Weak Credentials): This is a class-level CWE and less specific than CWE-321.\n- CWE-304 (Missing Critical Step in Authentication): This CWE doesn't exactly fit because the **rootcause** isn't necessarily a missing step, but the **use of static encryption key material**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
