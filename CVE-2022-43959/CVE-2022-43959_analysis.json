CWE-256 is a child of CWE-522, making it more specific, as the password was stored in plaintext. CWE-798, Use of Hard-coded Credentials, is also related as hardcoded values are often insufficiently protected. CWE-200, Exposure of Sensitive Information, is a high-level class related to the impact but is discouraged as a primary mapping.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe540[\"CWE-540: Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Source Code\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe540 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe200\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe798 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe540 primary\n    class cwe522,cwe256,cwe798 secondary\n    class cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient protection of credentials**, which leads to the **inclusion of the password in cleartext within the source code**, and finally results in the **exposure of sensitive information** to remote administrators.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability and its subsequent impact. The primary focus was on the fact that the password was exposed in the source code.\n\nThe selection of CWE-540 is strongly supported by the vulnerability description, which explicitly states that the AD/LDAP administrative password can be discovered by reading the source code of `/bitrix/admin/ldap_server_edit.php`. The \"**Insufficiently Protected Credentials**\" leads to the **password being included in the source code**, allowing its discovery.\n\nCWE-540 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the inclusion of sensitive information in the source code. Other considered CWEs, such as CWE-200, represent the impact (exposure of sensitive information) rather than the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage

Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible

guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 5697.65\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a hard-coded password,",
