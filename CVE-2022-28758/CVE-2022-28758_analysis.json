While CWE-284 is a high-level Pillar, CWE-285 is a Class. CWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**) is also a child of CWE-285, representing a more specific type of authorization failure. Due to the provided information, it is hard to decide if **authorization** was missing or **incorrect**. Therefore, I picked **Improper Authorization** as the primary weakness, with **Incorrect Authorization** as a secondary.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **improper access control**, leading to unauthorized access to audio and video feeds.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**improper access control**\" as the root cause, making it a key factor in the CWE selection. The retriever results also list CWE-284 (**Improper Access Control**), CWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**), and CWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**) as potential candidates.\n\nThe description states, \"a malicious actor could obtain the audio and video feed of a meeting they were not authorized to join,\" which points to an authorization issue. Therefore, CWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**) is the most appropriate primary CWE.\n\nThe MITRE mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-284 (**Improper Access Control**) due to its high-level nature and suggests using more specific descendants. Since the vulnerability involves unauthorized access to meeting feeds, CWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**) is a better fit. The authorization could have either been missing or implemented in an **incorrect** fashion. I can't say for sure which one occurred, so I am picking the parent **Improper Authorization**.\n\nI considered other CWEs such as CWE-940 (**Improper Verification of Source of a Communication Channel**) and CWE-639 (**Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key**), but they are not as directly relevant to the provided description. The core issue is that the system **does not properly** authorize access to meeting feeds, rather than a problem with communication channel verification or user-controlled keys.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately capture the root cause (**improper access control**) and the resulting impact (unauthorized access to meeting feeds).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
