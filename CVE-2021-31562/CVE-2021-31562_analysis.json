The analysis considered its children, as recommended in the mapping guidance. The relationships between the various cryptographic weaknesses were also considered to determine if any chain relationships existed. The analysis considered CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information), CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation), and CWE-757 (Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')) as secondary issues related to the SSL/TLS configuration.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe295[\"CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\"]\n    cwe757[\"CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n\n    cwe327 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe757 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe295 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe311 -->|PEEROF| cwe327\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe327 primary\n    class cwe319,cwe295,cwe757 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **serious deficiencies in the SSL/TLS configuration**, which leads to potential exploitation through:\n  - The use of **broken or risky cryptographic algorithms** (CWE-327)\n  - Potential for **cleartext transmission of sensitive information** (CWE-319)\n  - **Improper certificate validation** (CWE-295)\n  - **Selection of less-secure algorithms during negotiation** (CWE-757).\n\nThe final impact includes:\n  - Eavesdropping on transferred data\n  - Manipulation of secured data\n  - Impersonation to gain access to sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points towards CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) due to the **rootcause** being **\"serious deficiencies in SSL/TLS configuration\"** and the explicit mention of **\"Use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm (CWE-327)\"** in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\". The other CWEs were chosen based on their potential contribution to the overall vulnerability based on the description and retriever results.\n\nThe selection of CWE-327 as the primary CWE is justified by the direct evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\". The abstraction level is a Class, but there is no additional information to make it more specific.\n\nCWE-319, CWE-295, and CWE-757 are included as secondary weaknesses because they describe other potential issues that could stem from **\"serious deficiencies in SSL/TLS configuration\"**. They are at the Base level of abstraction, providing more specific insights into the weakness than the Class level CWE-327.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
