The vulnerability involves calling `free()` on memory that was not allocated on the heap due to a **disturbed heap layout** which leads to memory corruption. CWE-590 is more specific and accurately describes the error.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe590[\"CWE-590: Free of Memory not on the Heap\"]\n    cwe762[\"CWE-762: Mismatched Memory Management Routines\"]\n\n    cwe590 -->|CHILDOF| cwe762\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe590 primary\n    class cwe762 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **disturbed heap layout**, leading to `calloc` not returning a zeroed buffer, and subsequently to `free(o->attr)` being called with an invalid pointer. This results in a crash, causing a Denial of Service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates that a **disturbed heap layout** causes an invalid pointer to be passed to `free()`. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" indicates that the `calloc` function does not return a zeroed buffer when the heap layout is disturbed, leading to `free(o->attr)` being called with an invalid pointer. This aligns precisely with CWE-590 (Free of Memory not on the Heap), as it involves calling `free()` on memory that was not allocated via heap allocation routines.\nThe evidence supporting this is: \"The `calloc` function in `tee_obj_alloc` does not return a zeroed buffer when the heap layout is disturbed. This leads to `free(o->attr)` being called with an invalid pointer.\"\nCWE-762 (Mismatched Memory Management Routines) was considered but is more general. Since the vulnerability specifically involves calling `free()` on memory not allocated on the heap, CWE-590 is a more precise fit.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
