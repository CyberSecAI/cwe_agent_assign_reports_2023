This CWE is a Variant, which is a preferred level of abstraction. The retriever results and similar CVE descriptions also strongly suggest this CWE. Other considered CWEs, like race conditions, are not directly supported by the provided information, although a race condition can precede a Use After Free.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on a Resource after Expiration\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n    cwe366[\"CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\"]\n\n    cwe416 -->|ChildOf| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|ChildOf| cwe672\n    cwe416 -->|CanPrecede| cwe120\n    cwe416 -->|CanPrecede| cwe123\n    cwe366 -->|CanPrecede| cwe416\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe825,cwe672,cwe120,cwe123,cwe366 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain, based on the description, starts with user interaction leading to a **use after free**, which can then result in **heap corruption**. The key elements in this chain are:\n\n1.  User Interaction (Trigger)\n2.  **CWE-416 (Use After Free)**\n3.  **Heap Corruption** (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the explicit mention of \"**use after free**\" in the vulnerability description and \"**rootcause:** **use after free**\" in the key phrases. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms \"**Use after free** in Omnibox.\" and identifies \"**Use after free**\" as one of the weaknesses.\n\nThe Retriever Results list **CWE-416 (Use After Free)** as the top match. The \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section lists **CWE-416** as the primary CWE match.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity (Variant) as it directly describes the nature of the vulnerability. Other CWEs, such as CWE-366 (Race Condition within a Thread), were considered but not selected because there's no direct evidence of a race condition in the description. The description focuses on memory being reused after being freed, which aligns perfectly with CWE-416.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-356: Product UI does not Warn User of Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product's user interface does not warn the user before undertaking an unsafe action on behalf of that user. This makes it easier for attackers to trick users into inflicting damage to their system.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n\n\n## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 7045.73\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is",
