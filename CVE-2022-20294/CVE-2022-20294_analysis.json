However, in this case, no specific type of authorization mechanism is mentioned, so the class-level CWE is appropriate. CWE-203 **Observable Discrepancy** is a potential secondary weakness as information disclosure can lead to observable differences in system behavior.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe203[\"CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe203 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission check** (CWE-862) leading to local information disclosure. This is a relatively short chain, with the missing authorization being the direct cause of the information leak.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **missing permission check** as the root cause of the vulnerability, which directly aligns with CWE-862 **Missing Authorization**. The evidence for this is the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section that identifies \"missing permission check\" as the root cause. The other candidate CWEs from the Retriever Results were considered, but they were either too general (CWE-20 **Improper Input Validation**) or did not accurately represent the root cause.\n\nThe decision to use CWE-862 is based on the clear statement that a permission check is **missing**. This is a direct authorization issue. While the impact is information disclosure, the root cause is the lack of authorization.\n\nCWE-203 **Observable Discrepancy** was considered as a secondary weakness. The vulnerability description mentions \"local information disclosure\". This disclosure could lead to observable discrepancies in the system's behavior, which might be exploitable. However, the primary issue remains the **missing** authorization check that allows the information disclosure in the first place.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives a complex input with multiple elements or fields that must be consistent with each other, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually consistent.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive -
