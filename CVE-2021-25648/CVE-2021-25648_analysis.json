The server relies on client-side mechanisms for security, which can be bypassed by modifying the client. |\n| CWE-472 | External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The application does not sufficiently verify parameters assumed to be immutable, leading to potential tampering. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-602 [Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security], indicating that the server relies on the client to enforce security measures. This makes the system vulnerable because the client-side controls can be easily bypassed. CWE-602 [Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security] is a class-level CWE, and it is related to CWE-693 [Protection Mechanism Failure].\n\nA related weakness is CWE-472 [External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter], which highlights that the application doesn't properly validate inputs assumed to be immutable, such as the \"isAdmin\" and \"isPremium\" parameters. This allows attackers to modify these parameters and gain unauthorized access. CWE-472 [External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter] is a base-level CWE and is a child of CWE-642 [External Control of Critical State Data] and CWE-471 [Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)].\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe602[\"CWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security\"]\n    cwe472[\"CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    cwe642[\"CWE-642: External Control of Critical State Data\"]\n    cwe471[\"CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)\"]\n\n    cwe602 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe472 -->|CHILDOF| cwe642\n    cwe472 -->|CHILDOF| cwe471\n    cwe602 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe472\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe602 primary\n    class cwe472 secondary\n    class cwe693,cwe642,cwe471 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the application relying on client-side storage for sensitive user permissions (\"isAdmin\" and \"isPremium\"). This leads to the ability to tamper with these values (CWE-472 [External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter]), and finally, gaining unauthorized access to administrative interface and premium features (CWE-602 [Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security]).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the reliance on client-side enforcement of security, as identified by CWE-602 [Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security]. The application trusts the client to maintain and enforce security measures, which is a flawed approach. The supporting evidence comes from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section, which states, \"The mobile application relies on client-side storage of user permissions, specifically the 'isAdmin' and 'isPremium' parameters.\" This aligns with the description of CWE-602 [Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security], which states, \"The product is composed of a server that relies on the client to implement a mechanism that is intended to protect the server.\"\n\nAdditionally, CWE-472 [External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter] is relevant because the application doesn't properly validate the \"isAdmin\" and \"isPremium\" parameters, which are assumed to be immutable. This allows an attacker to modify these values and gain unauthorized access. This is also supported by the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section, which mentions that the application \"does not properly validate or secure these permissions.\"\n\nI considered other CWEs like CWE-285 [Improper Authorization] and CWE-287 [Improper Authentication], but they are too high-level. CWE-602 [Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security] and CWE-472 [External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter] are more specific and better capture the root cause of the vulnerability. I am overriding the Retriever's recommendation to use CWE-285 [Improper Authorization] and CWE-287 [Improper Authentication] as they are too generic for this case.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
